<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Our literature is rich enough in works on the principles of
Political Economy. So far as the translator is informed,
however, it possesses none in which the science is treated in
accordance with the historical method. We may therefore
venture to express the hope that this translation will fill a
place hitherto unoccupied in the literatures of England and
America, and fill it all the more efficiently and acceptably,
as Professor <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Roscher</span></span> is the founder and still the leader of
the historical school of Political Economy. Were this the
only recommendation of our undertaking, it would not be a
useless one. But a glance at Professor <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Roscher's</span></span> book will
convince even the most hasty reader that its pages fascinate
by their interest and are rich in treasures of erudition which
should not remain inaccessible to the English student from
being locked up in a foreign tongue.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The present translation has received, throughout, the revision
of the author, and should any imperfections remain in the
rendering of his thought into English, the blame is certainly
not his, for his revision has been most minute.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The three appendices have been supplied by Professor
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Roscher</span></span> expressly for this edition. As they are intended to
form a part of the work on the Political Economy of Industry
and Commerce, on which he is now engaged, he authorizes
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagevi">[pg vi]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pgvi"></a>
their publication in English, only by the publishers of this
edition of his principles; and only for the purpose of being
added to the present translation. He desires especially that
their appearance in their present shape should not in any way
interfere with any of his rights in his forthcoming volume,
and that they should not be translated into any language nor
translated back into German.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The essay of Mr. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Wolowski</span></span>, on the historical method in
Political Economy constitutes no part of Professor <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Roscher's</span></span>
book, and neither he nor its author, but only the translator, is
responsible for its appearance here. In it the reader will find
a short sketch of the life of Professor <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Roscher</span></span>, brought
down to the date at which the essay was written. The translator
has little to add to that sketch, all the information he
possesses in addition to what it contains being embraced in
the following lines from a letter received by him from the
author in answer to a request that he would supply the biographical
data not to be found in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Wolowski's</span></span> essay: <span class="tei tei-q">“You
might perhaps say ... that I have repeatedly declined calls
to the Universities of Munich, Vienna and Berlin, but that
I have never regretted remaining in Leipzig.”</span>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The acknowledgments of the translator are due, in the
first place, to the eminent author himself, for the revision of
the plate-proof of the entire work, and then to Professor
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">William F. Allen</span></span>, of the University of Wisconsin, for his
interest in the progress of the enterprise, and for many valuable
suggestions; also to Professor <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">W. G. Sumner</span></span>, of
Yale College, for some excellent hints as to the best translation
of certain words in the Appendix on Paper Money.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Of the peculiar method which I have followed in this work,
and which will produce still better fruits in the succeeding
volumes, I have given a sufficient explanation in
§§ <a class="tei tei-ref pginternal" href="#Section_26">26</a> ff., and
all I desire now is to say a few words on the relation the notes
bear to the text. The careful reader will soon be convinced
that of the many citations in this work, not one has been made
from a vain desire of the display of erudition. Part of them
serves as the necessary proof of surprising facts adduced, but
which are little known. Another part of them is intended to
incite the reader to the study of certain questions nearly related
to those treated in the text, but which are still different
from them. The object of the greater number is to supply
information concerning the history of economic principles. As
far as the sources at my command permitted, I have endeavored
to point out the first germs, the chief stages of development,
the contrasts, and, finally, what has been thus far attained
in economic science. This sometimes required some
little victory over self, inasmuch as I was conscious of having
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pageviii">[pg viii]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pgviii"></a>
independently discovered certain facts, when I afterwards
found that some old and long-forgotten writer had made similar
observations. Thus, this work may serve both as a handbook
and as a history of the literature of Political Economy.
Students of the science know how little has thus far been
done by writers in this direction. And hence I shall be very
grateful to those who labor in the same field, if they will, either
by writing to me personally, or through the medium of the
press, inform me when I have erred in ascribing a truth, or a
scientifically important error, to its earliest author.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I have already said in the title that this work is intended
not for the learned only, but for all educated men, for men of
a serious turn of mind, who desire truth and science for their
own sake. Like that ancient historian, whom I honor above
all others as my teacher, I desire that my work should be
useful to those, ὅσοι βουλήσοντοι τῶν τε γενομένων τὸ σαφὲς

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The preface to the second edition is dated October, 1856;
that to the third, April, 1858; that to the fourth, April, 1861;
that to the fifth, November, 1863; that to the sixth, November,
1865; that to the seventh, November, 1868; that to the
eighth, August, 1869; that to the ninth, March, 1871; that to
the tenth, May, 1873; that to the eleventh (unaltered), December,
1873. Each successive edition, nearly, has been announced
as an improved and enlarged one; and the tenth
edition contains one hundred and fifty-six pages more than
the first, although in places, a large number of abbreviations
had been made from previous editions. There are many
things in some of the previous editions which criticism induced
me, long since, to change. I have considered it my duty to
the public, who gave my work so warm and friendly a reception,
to take into consideration, in each successive edition, not
only my own new investigations, but those also of all others
with which I became acquainted, and, whenever possible, to
correct statistical illustrations from the latest sources. I have
especially, in each following edition, enriched a number of
paragraphs with here and there historical, ethnographic and
statistical features. Plutarch is certainly right, spite of the
fact that pedants may abuse him for it, when he says, that
trifling acts, a word and even a jest, are often more important,
as characterizing the life of a people or an age, than great
battles which cost the lives of tens of thousands of men.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I have changed the titles <span class="tei tei-q">“Ricardo's Law of Rent,”</span> and
<span class="tei tei-q">“The Malthusian Law of the Increase of Population,”</span> which
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagex">[pg x]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pgx"></a>
I formerly used, for others. But I would not be misunderstood
here. I hold it to be a duty of reverence in the
learned—as it has long been practiced in the case of the natural
sciences—in the sciences of the human mind to call the
natural laws, methods etc., in acquainting us with which, some
one particular investigator has won very distinguished merit,
by the name of that investigator. In the case of the law of
rent, the application of this rule would as unquestionably entitle
Ricardo to this honor as it would Malthus in that of
the increase of population, spite of the fact that Ricardo may
not have succeeded in finding the best possible form of the
abstraction, and although Malthus even, in a one-sided reaction
against a former still greater one-sidedness, was not
always able to steer clear of positive and negative errors.
Recent science has endeavored, and successfully, to examine
the facts which contradict the Ricardoan and Malthusian formulations
of the laws in question, and to extend the formulas
accordingly. I have myself contributed hereto to the extent
of my ability. But, in the interval, it is not hard to comprehend
that, while this process of elucidation is going on,
most scholars, those especially possessed more of a dogmatic
than of a historical turn of mind, should estimate these two
leaders more in accordance with their few defects than with
the great merits of their discoveries. If, therefore, I now
drop the title <span class="tei tei-q">“Malthusian law,”</span> it is to guard hasty readers
from the illusion that §§ 242 seq.
teach what the great crowd understand by Malthusianism; when they might, perhaps,
omit that portion entirely. For my own part, I have no doubt
that, when the process of elucidation above referred to shall
have been thoroughly finished, the future will accord both to
Ricardo and Malthus their full meed of honor as political
economists and discoverers of the first rank.<a href="#note_1" id="noteref_1" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1</span></span></a>

It is no foolish desire to make a vain display of citations, that
induces us, at the beginning of this essay, intended to point out
the results of the application of a new method to the study of
Political Economy, to invoke the authority of a poet and moralist,
of a jurisconsult and of a philosopher. The writer finds in
the words just quoted the loftiest expression of the thought
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page002">[pg 002]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg002"></a>
which dictates these lines, viz.: that the impartial researches
of history, a profound feeling of man's moral and material wants,
and the light of philosophy, should govern in the teaching of
a science, the object of which is to show us how those things
which are intended to satisfy our wants are produced and distributed
among the several classes or individuals of a nation;
how they are exchanged one against another, and how they
are consumed.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The nineteenth century affords us something more than the
admirable spectacle of the rapid and fertile development of
mechanical power and natural forces. This is but one of the
aspects, we might even say but one of the results, of the general
progress of the human mind. The renovation of moral
and intellectual studies has served as a starting point for the
application to facts of the conquests of thought. Science has
preceded art.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the foremost rank of the studies just referred to is
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">philosophy</span></span>, which initiates us into the knowledge of human nature,
the basis of right, and which translates its legitimate aspirations
into a language which we can understand; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">history</span></span>, that
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">prophetess</span></span> of the truth, as one of the ancients called it, which
places before us the faithful picture of times past, not by
simply putting together a skeleton of facts, but by following
the living progress of events and the organic development of
institutions. Such, at least, has been the work of those noble
minds who have consecrated their energies to the resuscitation
of ages past, in their true shape, and such is the service for
which we are indebted to them for the successful accomplishment
of the reformation of historical studies, which they
attempted with such rare devotion and such marvelous sagacity.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This renovation of history has exerted the most fertile influence
in the region of philosophy, in that of law, and we
believe that it will prove no less useful in that of Political Economy.
It has served to put us on our guard against being
easily misled by <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span> notions.
</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page003">[pg 003]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg003"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
By exhibiting to us the results of the life and of the experience
of centuries, by teaching us by what steps the human
mind has risen to its present eminence, and what the education
given it in the past has been, it has enabled us to ascend from
phenomena to the principles which preside over them; from
facts to the law; and it has substituted for arbitrary assumptions
and purely ideal systems, the slow but progressive work
of the genius of nations. Not that it turns a deaf ear to the
exalted lessons of philosophy, nor that it denies the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">eternal relations
resulting from the nature of things</span></em>. Far from it. On
the contrary, it supplies a solid basis to intellectual investigations,
and, so to speak, an answer for all the moral sciences, to
this saying of Rœderer: <span class="tei tei-q">“Politics is a field which has been
traversed thus far only in a balloon; it is time to put foot on
solid ground.”</span>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Neither does history, as thus understood, confine itself to
mere description; it also assumes the office of judge. While
it pulls down much that passion and inaccuracy have reared, and
thus restores respect for the past, it does not turn that past into
a fetish. It looks it boldly in the face and questions it, instead
of prostrating itself before it and worshipping it with downcast
eyes. Thus, by plainly showing us the many bonds which tie
us to it, it escapes at once both the rashness of impatience and
the wearisomeness of routine.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The impartiality it inculcates is not indifference; and there
is no danger that the justice it metes out to past ages shall degenerate
into a vain scepticism or a convenient optimism.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The study of history, thus understood, has another advantage;
it accustoms us to those patient and disinterested investigations,
to those lengthy labors, the positive result of which at first
escapes us for a time, only to burst on our eyes, with so much
more brilliancy, when rigorous research has succeeded in discovering
it. It frees us from the deadly constraint of immediate
utility.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is nothing more fatal to science than the feverish impatience
for results which obtains only too much in our own
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page004">[pg 004]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg004"></a>
days, and which induces people to run after him who is in the
greatest hurry, and which leads to hasty conclusions.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Research undertaken from a disinterested love of science,”</span>
says the learned Hugo, one of the masters of the historical school
of law in Germany,<a href="#note_5" id="noteref_5" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">5</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“that research which at first promises no
other advantage but truth and the culture of the mind, is precisely
that which brings us the richest rewards. Would we
not be behind, in all the sciences, if we had clung only to those
principles, the utility of which in practice was already known?
Do we not, to-day, from many a discovery, reap advantages of
which its author never dreamed?”</span>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Doubtless this tendency, unless restrained by other demands,
is not exempt from danger. We may be carried away by the
attraction peculiar to these noble studies, withdraw into antiquity
and fall into a species of historical mysticism which ends
in the affirmation, that whatever has been is true, absolutely,
and which, instead of confining itself to the explanation of
transitory phenomena, invests them with all the dignity of principles.
We shall endeavor to avoid the peril pointed out by
Mallebranche. <span class="tei tei-q">“Learned men study rather to acquire a
chimerical greatness in the imagination of other men, than to
acquire greater breadth and strength of mind themselves.
They make their heads a kind of store-room, into which they
gather, without order or discrimination, everything which has
a look of erudition,—I mean to say everything which may
seem rare or extraordinary and excite the wonder of other
people. They glory in getting together, in this archæological
museum, antiques with nothing that is rich or solid about them,
and the price of which depends on nothing but fancy, chance
or passion.”</span>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A display of erudition may obscure the truth, and bury it under
its weight, instead of bringing it out into relief. By concentrating
the mind on the material vestiges of the past, it
may withdraw it from the intellectual movement of the present,
and give us a race of scholars, of great merit, doubtless,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page005">[pg 005]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg005"></a>
but who move about like strangers among their contemporaries.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Without a sense for the practical, and without ideas of an
elevated nature, a person may, indeed, be a man of erudition—he
cannot be a historian. As the proverb says, the forest cannot
be seen, for the trees. That this noble study may bear its
best and most useful fruit; that is, that it should preserve us
against ambitious <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">formulas</span></span> and destructive chimeras, we
must pursue another way.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The world,”</span> says Montaigne, <span class="tei tei-q">“is incapable of curing itself.
It is so impatient of what burthens it, that it thinks only
of how it shall rid itself of it, without inquiring at what price.
A thousand examples show us that it cures itself ordinarily at
its own cost. The getting rid of the present evil is not cure,
unless there be a general amendment of condition. Good does
not immediately succeed evil. One evil, and a worse, may
follow another, like Cæsar's assassins, who brought the
republic to such a pass, that they had reason to repent the
meddling with it.”</span> Such, too frequently, is the lot of those
who, abandoning themselves to their imagination, and without
consulting the past, mix together promises of liberty and
the despotism of Utopias which they would impose on nations
under pretext of enfranchising them. Despising the work of
the ages, they think they can build upon a soil shaken by destruction
and crumbled, until it may be likened to moving sand.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Contempt for the past is associated with a passion for
reform. Men think of destroying that which should only
be transformed. They condemn everything that has been,
unconditionally, and launch out towards a new future. The
suffering which has been gone through irritates and troubles
the mind. The work of pulling down is so easy, it is supposed
that the work of building up is equally so. Hence systems
rise, as if the world were to begin anew. The pride of
liberty and of human action becomes the principle of science;
and, like all new principles, it pretends to exclusive and absolute
dominion. Rationalism governs; abstract philosophy
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page006">[pg 006]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg006"></a>
ignores the traditions and the requirements of the life of nations;
and finds now in it, as in geometry, nothing but principles and
deductions. The memory of recent oppression causes us
to act as Tarquin did, and to level down the higher classes instead
of elevating the inferior. Liberty and equality then govern
by their negative side, instead of exercising the positive and
beneficent influence they should have, to develop all forces to
their utmost, to ennoble the mind, to give more elasticity to
the soul and greater vigor to thought, to give birth to those
varied forms and to that moral energy, which should bring us
nearer to final equality in the bosom of
God.<a href="#note_6" id="noteref_6" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">6</span></span></a>

virtue! Because the form has been changed, we believe that
we have changed human nature.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is easy to understand, why, where these ideas prevail, the
study of the past should be neglected and despised. Efforts
are made to avoid it. Why, it is asked, revive memories of
oppression and misery? The old world is wrecked. It is
annihilated. Peace to its ashes! Or else, after it has been
destroyed, it is sought for again; and, under pretext of eradicating
the evils existing in it, an attack is made on the eternal
basis on which human society rests, on the laws not made by
man, and which it is not given to man to change. The world
becomes one vast laboratory, in which the rashest experiments
are multiplied in number, in which mankind is but clay in the
hands of the potter which every pretended <span class="tei tei-q">“thinker”</span> may
mould at will, by giving him the false appearances of independence
and of an emancipated being.
</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page007">[pg 007]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg007"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And, indeed, if the will of man be all-powerful, if states are
to be distinguished from one another only by their boundaries,
if everything may be changed like the scenery in a play by a
flourish of the magic wand of a system, if man may arbitrarily
make the right, if nations can be put through evolutions like a
regiment of troops; what a field would the world present for
attempts at the realization of the wildest dreams, and what a
temptation would be offered to take possession, by main force,
of the government of human affairs, to destroy the rights of
property and the rights of capital, to gratify ardent longings
without trouble, and provide the much coveted means of enjoyment.
The Titans have tried to scale the heavens, and
have fallen into the most degrading materialism. Purely
speculative dogmatism sinks into materialism.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All is changed, both men and things. Yet we hear the
same old style of declamation. There are those who wish to
plough up the soil which the harrow of the revolution went
over yesterday; and they believe they are marching in the
way of progress. They do not see that they have mistaken
their age, and that the bold attempts of the past have now
come to possess a directly opposite meaning. Without stopping
to inquire to what side the new world inclines, they repeat
the same words, and swear <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">in
verba magistri</span></span>, and go the
road of destruction, believing themselves to be creating the
world anew!
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Nothing is more natural than that these excesses should
produce other excesses, in a contrary direction. Moved by
hatred or fear of revolutionary absolutism, nations seek an
asylum in governmental absolutism, or they retrograde towards
the middle ages, and consider the mutual bond of protection
and dependence of that period as the ideal and the
realization of true liberty. History is no longer the organic
development of social life, and man, like a soldier that
thoughtlessly and capriciously has gone beyond his place of
supplies, is obliged to retrace his steps. The reaction is
clearly defined. The past is opposed to the present, not as a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page008">[pg 008]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg008"></a>
lesson to be turned to advantage, but as a model which must
be hastily accepted; and men become revolutionary in a backward
direction.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
However, history, rigorously studied, knows neither these
complaisances nor these weaknesses. It does not descend to
the apotheosis of a past which cannot return again. The real
historical spirit consists in rightly discerning what belongs to
each epoch. Its object is, by no means, to call back the dead
to life, but to explain why and how they lived. In harmony
with a healthy philosophy, it assigns a limit to the vagaries of
arbitrary will, beyond which the latter cannot go. It unceasingly
calls us back, from the heights of abstraction, to positive
facts and things.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the creation of systems, only one thing was wont to be
forgotten, men, who were treated, in them, like so many
ciphers; for intellectual despotism has this in common with all
despotic authority. History teaches us that we can reach
nothing great or lasting, but by addressing ourselves to the
soul. If the soul decays, there can be no longer great thoughts
or great actions. Society lives by the spirit which inhabits it.
It may, for an instant, submit to the empire of force, but, in the
long run, it hearkens only to the voice of justice. It was thus
that the greatest revolution which history records, that of
Christianity, was accomplished. It addressed itself only to
the soul; but by changing the hearts of men, it transformed
society entirely.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The violent struggle between an imperious dogmatism and
an unintelligent and mistaken attempt at a retrogressive movement
is resolved into a higher view, which permits the union
of conservatism and progress. Violent attempts and rash endeavors
made, threatened to bring contempt on the noblest
teachings of philosophy, and to make them repulsive to man;
and, on the other hand, a blind respect for the institutions consecrated
by history threatened to stifle all examination and all
freedom of judgment.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But a healthier doctrine has permitted us to understand, that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page009">[pg 009]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg009"></a>
we are continuing the work of preceding generations; that we
are developing the germs which they successively sowed;
that we are perfecting that which they had only sketched, and
that we are letting drop that which has no support in the
social condition of man. Every thing is connected; each
thing is linked to every other; nothing is repeated. The
hopes of sudden and total renovation, based on absolute formulas,
vanish before the touch of this solid study. This shows
us how firm and unshaken are those reforms which have begun
by taking hold of the minds of men, the precise spirit of
which had penetrated into the souls of whole nations before
they had manifested themselves in facts.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Law and Economy constitute a part of the life of nations in
the same way that language and customs do. The power of
history in no way contradicts the supremacy of reason.

These two tendencies, the rationalistic and the historical, are
everywhere found face to face. They carry on an eternal
warfare, which is renewed in every age, under new names
and new forms. Accomplished facts and renovating thought
divide the world between them. They at one time moderate
its speed, and at others, spur it on its way. But these two
forces, instead of compromising the destinies of humanity by
their opposing action, maintain and balance them, as the contrary
impulses given by the hand of the Great Architect has
peopled the universe with worlds which gravitate in space.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Victor Cousin, a very competent authority on the subject,
has said that the history of philosophy is the torch of philosophy
itself. The remarkable works which have enriched it in
this direction are well known. History, on its side, is enlightened
by philosophy. Thus, it teaches us not to despise
facts, but at the same time not to be slaves to precedent. It
does equal justice to the incredulous and to the fanatic, to too
supple practitioners and to intractable theorizers.

the idea of right are the work of the legislator. It is not law
that made the family, property, liberty, equality, the idea of
good and evil. It may, indeed, give organization to all these
things, but in doing so, it is only working on the foundation
which nature has laid, and it is perfect in proportion as it
comes nearer to the eternal, immutable laws which the Creator
has engraved on our hearts. What changes is not the eternal
law, the revelation of which comes to man incessantly and by
a necessary action, but the form in which humanity clothes it,
the institutions which man builds on its immutable
foundation.”</span><a href="#note_10" id="noteref_10" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">10</span></span></a>

We therefore believe in the law of nature, and regret that our
opinion is not shared by Mr. Roscher, at least that he does
not explicitly enough express his faith in it, nor apply it broadly
enough in the beautiful work which we are happy to render
accessible to the French public.<a href="#note_11" id="noteref_11" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">11</span></span></a> We believe in it in its
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page011">[pg 011]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg011"></a>
philosophical sense, and not simply in the juridical sense attached
to it by Ulpian. <span class="tei tei-q">“Let us not,”</span> observes Portalis,
<span class="tei tei-q">“confound the physical order of nature, common to all animated
beings, with the natural law which is peculiar to man.
We call <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">natural law</span></span>, the principles which govern man considered
as a moral being, that is, as an intelligent and free being,
intended to live in the society of other beings, intelligent and
free like himself.”</span><a href="#note_12" id="noteref_12" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">12</span></span></a> Ulpian's famous tripartite division, of natural
law, the law of nations, and the civil law, is proof, from
the meaning he attaches to them, either of a misunderstanding
or of the imperfect idea which the Stoics had conceived
of the essence of natural law. In vain Cujas exhausted all
the resources of his noble intellect to explain it.<a href="#note_13" id="noteref_13" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">13</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is necessary to draw a distinction between physical law
and the law (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">droit</span></span>) of intelligent beings. Doubtless the existence
of men as well as that of animals is limited by time.
They both live and die; but the soul escapes the necessities
of material nature.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The moment there is question of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">right</span></span>, intelligence governs,
reason comes into play, and the science of right and wrong is
appealed to as a guide. Hence the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">natural</span></span> law of the human
species is not the physical law which all creatures obey.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was necessary for us to insist upon these principles. It
was necessary for us to show that there is a law independent
of positive and local law, a law which is not the expression of
an arbitrary will, but an emanation from the nature of
things.<a href="#note_14" id="noteref_14" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">14</span></span></a>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Hence come the features in common which we meet with
everywhere, and the variable forms which develop law in harmony
with the special conditions of each civil society.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We must descend into the very depths of human nature to
discover these eternal and permanent laws; and if the mere
effort of the mind should not reach them directly, they might
be discovered in the phenomena of the life of nations. History
affords us the counter-proof and confirmation of the philosophical
doctrine.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The development of society does not afford a mathematical
expression of these higher truths. It gives them a form
which is unceasingly modified in the written law. The person
who discovers in them nothing but an absolute rule, looks
upon the changes as evidences of caprice and error. He alone
understands the revolutions of things who knows their cause
and the necessity which produces them.

Solon was right when he gave the Athenians not the most
perfect laws, but the best which they could bear.

It is not in the attempts contemporary with the infancy of
society, or nearly so, that we are to look for the complete realization
of the precepts of the natural law; for principles obey
the rule laid down by Aristotle. <span class="tei tei-q">“The nature of each thing
is precisely that which constitutes its end; and when each being
has attained its entire development, we say that that is its
own proper nature.”</span><a href="#note_15" id="noteref_15" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">15</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The ideas of natural law are purified in proportion as society
grows enlightened and free; but the truth appears only
successively in the phases it passes through. It allows us to
grasp one aspect of itself after another, but does not surrender
itself entirely, at any one moment, to the investigations of the
historian or the jurisconsult.

The two schools, that of philosophy and that of history
have met in our day, in the field of law. Who is there that
does not remember the great and noble contest carried on,
about the beginning of this century, between two descendants
of Frenchmen who had sought a refuge in Germany,
and who united in their own persons, and in so marvelous a
manner, the different aptitudes of the country they owed their
origin to, and of the land that gave them birth,—between Thibaut
and Savigny?
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It would be difficult to find a scientific question of a higher
character, debated by champions more worthy to throw light
upon it.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">Code Napoléon</span></span>
had appeared. It had, to use Rossi's
happy expression, transferred into law the social revolution
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page014">[pg 014]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg014"></a>
produced by the destruction of privilege. It was the practical
formula expressive of the conquests which had been made.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The philosophy of the eighteenth century had previously
inspired the Prussian Code. And yet, it was on the question of
codification that this memorable controversy was carried on.
The two principal combatants, while manfully battling, the one
against the other, continued to hold each other in high esteem,
and the profound study of law was developed in the midst of
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">melée</span></span>.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We cannot delay long on this subject, nor analyze the arguments
advanced by Thibaut<a href="#note_16" id="noteref_16" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">16</span></span></a>
and Savigny.<a href="#note_17" id="noteref_17" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">17</span></span></a> What interests
us at present is not so much the question debated, as the
intellectual movement to which it gave birth. Savigny sustained
the ancient law, Thibaut attacked it. Numerous and
distinguished jurisconsults ranged themselves on the one side
and the other. A new school grew up which, with the most
brilliant success, made law throw light on history and history
on law.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The application of the historical method to the study of law
was productive of the most happy results.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Without acknowledging it to themselves, the chiefs of the
contending parties were each obeying a political impulse.
Savigny was by his birth and his tastes carried into the camp
of conservatism; Thibaut, led by his convictions, into the liberal
ranks. Nevertheless, the natural elevation of their genius
preserved them from all exaggeration. The glorious defender
of tradition preserved a liberal spirit, and the ardent advocate
of reform desired no upheaval.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In what more nearly concerns the question with which we
are now occupied, Savigny—while he maintained that law was
something contingent, human, national; and while he brought
out into relief the practical and exalted character of its successive
developments which introduced reform and guarded
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page015">[pg 015]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg015"></a>
against revolution—developments which, not confiding in the
letter of the written law, unceasingly feed the living and
created law, that law called in the energetic language of a
great jurisconsult, a law <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">écrit
es coeurs des citoyens</span></span>—is
far from denying the importance of a high and healthy philosophy
which directs man in the uninterrupted labor to which he is
called, in the sphere of jurisprudence.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Men can no more renounce law than language, the forms of
which last they have gradually modified in order to better
translate their thoughts into words. The legislator's task is
the successive elaboration of obligatory provisions. He will
sometimes oppose and sometimes second the natural progress
of law; but, in doing so, it will ever be necessary for him to
ascend to the nature of things, and grasp their relations, if he
would not go astray in practice, or lose himself among the
successive and partial changes to which the illustrious Berlin
professor would confine the legitimate ambition of legislative
power. To go beyond this, in an age like ours, seemed to
him to be a work of destruction. However, far from denying
the influence of thought, and therefore of philosophy, acting
within its sphere, Savigny invokes its fertile aid.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thibaut, on the other hand, with more confidence in the
powers of the spirit of modern times, did not believe a good
codification to be impossible. His starting point had been a
cry for national independence. He well knew how much veneration
was due those institutions which were the slow and progressive
work of national genius, and what was the power they
possessed. He wished, therefore, to reform, not to abolish
them. He well understood that the greatness of the
<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">Code Napoléon</span></span>
itself, and the respect which it inspired were due to the
fact that its roots ran deep into the soil of the past, even while
the modern idea it contained shone like a bright light in the
world of things. Hence, without contesting the value of history,
he refused to acknowledge its right to exclusive reign.<a href="#note_18" id="noteref_18" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">18</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The life and activity prevailing in the study of law, and the
brilliant successes that study has recently achieved, are due, in
great part, to the illustrious representatives of the historical
school. We may add, here, that the French historical school,
which has so worthily inherited the spirit of Montesquieu, has
not achieved less in this direction than the older German
school. It has reconciled the opposing but not mutually hostile,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page017">[pg 017]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg017"></a>
tendencies of Savigny and Thibaut. It has conscientiously
scrutinized facts to show their concatenation, and to
allow their meaning and bearing to be clearly grasped. A
French jurisconsult, who is at the same time our highest authority
in the natural law, opened the way by his excellent essays
on the necessity of reforming the historical studies applicable
to law; on the influence of the legists on French civilization<a href="#note_19" id="noteref_19" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">19</span></span></a>
etc.; and by his prefaces, equal in value to whole works,
on hypothecation, sales, loans, partnership, charter-parties etc.
He may truly be said to have renewed the ancient and prolific
alliance of history and law.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Instead of pursuing a pure abstraction, this historical school
has confined itself to the knowledge of the life of man and the
evolution of society. It has applied to law, with what success
is well known, the principle which has regenerated the social
sciences, philosophy, letters, history, Political Economy,—sciences
which are, so to speak, different provinces of one intellectual
empire, which interpenetrate one another without being
confounded one with another, between which no jealous barrier
should be raised, and between which reciprocity of exchange
should be encouraged by the suppression of factitious
duties, which have existed only too long.

We need not dwell any longer on the character of the historical
method as applied to law, nor on the services it has
already rendered. On this point, there can be no two opinions.
And, if any one wonders that we should speak of it at all, in a
work on Political Economy, we can only say to him, that we
have done so to call his attention to an instructive precedent,
and for the further reason that the same method is peculiarly
well adapted to the study of Political Economy. Its advantages
are the same here, its tendencies the same, and the same motives
exist to induce us to use it here. In describing the successive
phases of the question in the case of law, we have
performed an important part of the task we had imposed upon
ourselves, of vindicating the employment of the historical
method, in the sphere of Political Economy.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The study of history is the best and most powerful antidote
against social romances and ideal fancies. François Beaudouin
was right when he said: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">Cæca
sine historia jurisprudentia</span></span>;”</span>
and we are very sure that, without history as an
element in it, Political Economy runs a great risk of walking
blindfold.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The human mind has need of being able to know where it
is at any moment, surrounded, as it is, by so many roads, running
in so many different directions. It ought to account to
itself for its progress, its deviations from the right path, and
for its mistakes.<a href="#note_20" id="noteref_20" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">20</span></span></a>
History alone can throw any light on questions
which are not simply intellectual curiosities, but which,
rather, are most deeply concerned with the vital interests of
society. It confirms the noble teachings of philosophy, by
showing how our life is made up of one unchanging tissue of
relations, and how man, even if he may vary their colors, and
change their design, cannot renew their texture.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It teaches us to admire nothing, and to despise nothing, beyond
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page019">[pg 019]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg019"></a>
measure. It enlightens us concerning questions of a
very complicated nature. Witnessing the evolutions of humanity,
following the development of social facts and theories,
we better discern principles, and grow wary in relation to the
alchemists of thought, who imagine that society may be made
to undergo a transformation between the rising and the setting
of the sun.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As there is a natural law, so, too, there are certain principles
of Political Economy which emanate from philosophy, and
may be reduced to one supreme principle; that of liberty and
responsibility. The domain of Political Economy is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">labor</span></em>
of generations. But we reject with all our strength, the materialistic
doctrine which, inexplicably confusing matters, endeavors
to assimilate ideas so distinct as intelligence and
things; and which would descend so low as to employ the
dynamometer to measure the creative force of man and its results,
and which sees only figures where there is a living soul.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Man is an intelligent being, served by organs,<a href="#note_21" id="noteref_21" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">21</span></span></a> by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">personal</span></em>
organs, with which the Creator has endowed him, by giving
him a body provided with marvellous aptitudes, by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">external</span></em>
organs which he finds in nature subjected to his power. Man
was created in the image of God, say the Scriptures, and
these words contain a deep meaning. He alone, of all terrestrial
beings, possesses a spark of divine intelligence. He alone
has been called to pursue the magnificent work of creation, by
giving a new face to a world to which he cannot add so much
as an atom.

Hence its dignity and grandeur. Hence, also, the
difficulties in the way of economic studies; since, to consider
them only as concerned with questions of material production,
is to forget that the products of industry are made for man,
not man for industrial products; to ignore the close relationship
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page020">[pg 020]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg020"></a>
between their fruitful investigations and the whole circle
of the moral sciences; to debase them and to mutilate them.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From the moment that science concerns itself with man
only, and the action of the mind; from the moment that its end
becomes not simply material enjoyment, but moral elevation,
the questions it discusses become indeed more complex, but
the answer, when found, is more prolific in results. Wealth,
then, is treated only as one of the forces of civilization. Other
interests than purely material ones occupy the first place.
This matter-of-fact philosophy which, according to Bacon's
precept, seeks to improve the conditions of life, bears in mind,
that the most fruitful source of material development lies in
intellectual development. It humbly recognizes that it is not
the first-born of the family, and draws new strength from this
avowal. From the moment that it is the mind which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">produces</span></em>
and which governs the world, intellectual and moral perfection
become the cause and effect of material progress. <span class="tei tei-q">“But seek
ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all
these things shall be added unto you.”</span>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The increase of production, then, appears an instrument of
elevation in the moral order.<a href="#note_23" id="noteref_23" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">23</span></span></a>
It is energy of soul, intelligence
and manly virtue which constitute the chief source of the wealth
of nations; which create it, develop it, and preserve it. Wealth
increases, declines, and disappears with the increase, decline
and disappearance of these noble attributes of the soul.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Labor is the child of thought. Nothing happens in the external
world which was not first conceived in the mind. The
hand is the servant of the intellect; and its work is successful,
beautiful or useful in proportion to the activity and development
of the intellect, and in proportion as the just, the beautiful
and the good exert their power over it.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Production is, therefore, not a material, but a spiritual, work.
How, then, can acts and their morality be separated? How
not understand that the market of labor has its own distinct
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page021">[pg 021]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg021"></a>
laws, and that education, even from a material stand-point, becomes
the highest interest and the most important duty of
society, since on it depends the efficiency of labor?

From the time that, after a long series of years, the doctrine
of Christianity had permeated the law of the civilized world;
from the time that the teaching of Paul, that all men are children
of one Father, took form and body, and that the principle
of the equality of all men before their Maker, was supplemented
by the doctrine and by the practice of that equality
before the laws, the thinking masses have endeavored to discover
the wherefore of their actions, and the why of their sufferings.
They have called the past to account, and inquired
why they have obtained so limited a share.

Economy is sacrifice, binding the present to the future,

Life ceases to be a worry about how the body shall be sustained,
and the material world becomes the shadow of the
spiritual. The former is made to serve the latter, and man's
free effort lifts him into a higher region of thought, and into a
larger field of action. The more mind there is put into a piece
of work, says Channing, the more it is worth.

We, men of to-day, are lookers-on at a marvelous spectacle.
Steam furrows the earth. Industry has taken an immense
start. Mechanical force bends the most rebellious materials.
Chemistry, physics and the natural sciences are discovering a
new world. But whence all this? What is the principle of
this new life? We answer: intellectual and moral progress.
Mind has grown; the soul has been expanded. God has permitted
man to be free, and furnished him with the means to
be so.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus man, as Mignet has said, becomes that mighty creature
to whom God has given the earth for the vast theater of his
action, the universe as the inexhaustible object of his knowledge,
the forces of nature for the growing service of his wants,
by allowing him, by ever increasing information, to obtain an
ever increasing amount of well-being.

Man is free.—1789 put in action the sublime precept of the
gospel. He holds his destiny in his own hands. But the
rights which he enjoys impose new duties on him. If <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">equality</span></em>
be the sentiment which predominates in our day, we should
take care not to confound it with the leveling of Communism.
Nor is it externally to us, but within ourselves, that it should
be developed, by intellectual and moral culture.

History preserves the student from being led astray by a too
servile adherence to any system. It exposes the folly of the

<span class="tei tei-q">“social contract,”</span> and of the idyllic dreams of the advantages
of savage life. It shows that nature, instead of being prodigal
of her treasures, distributes them with a niggardly hand, and
that it is necessary to conquer her by labor, intelligence and patience
before we can control her.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It shows us human liberty growing stronger every day,
thanks to moral and intellectual progress, supported by the
two powerful props of property, the complement of man, the
material reflection of his spiritual power; and capital, the fruit
of abstinence, the symbol of moral power and the result of
enlightened activity.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
History walks with a firm step, because it feels secure in a
knowledge of the laws of human nature, and in its experience
of the successive manifestations of social life. Instead of the
vagueness of ideal conceptions, it allows us to grasp and to
appreciate what is real in life. It does not confine itself to the
study of man. It makes us acquainted with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">men</span></em>, whose
wants extend and are ennobled in proportion to the perfection
of their faculties. The feelings and the intellect are simultaneously
developed in man. The savage is the most egotistical
of men.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Hence, we believe that Political Economy cannot dispense
with the services of morals and philosophy, of history and
law; for these are branches of one common trunk, through
all of which the self-same sap circulates.

The isolation of the theory of Political Economy is peculiar
to our own day. In more remote times, we find this study
confounded with the other moral sciences, of which it was an
integral part. When the genius of Adam Smith gave it a
distinct character, he did not desire to separate it from those
branches of knowledge without which it could only remain a
bleached plant from the absence of the sunlight of ethics.

years could pass away without leaving any trace of what enlightened
men had thought and elaborated in the matter of
Political Economy, among so many nations, and that people
should never have thought of cultivating this rich intellectual
domain, while in every other direction, it is easy for us to ascend
by a road already cleared up to the most remote antiquity.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It has already been acknowledged, that the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">classic domain</span></span>,
fertilized by intellectual culture on a large scale and on a small
one, was exceedingly rich in valuable indications, although
they do not present themselves under the distinct form, which
later affected the different branches of public life.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As to the pretended <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">primitive simplicity</span></span> of the middle ages,
which it is claimed, prevailed during that period, a species of
economic vegetation, those who maintain it forget the long
series of communistic theories which, at near intervals, found
expression in many a bloody struggle, and whose repression required
the combined efforts of Church and State.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Doubtless, it is not in their modern forms that the elements
of politico-economical science are to be found, in the past. But
when we succeed in reuniting the scattered and broken parts;
when we have made our way into the customs, decrees, ordinances,
capitularies, laws and regulations of those times; when,
so to speak, we come, unaware, upon the life of nations, in the
most ingenuous and confidential documents which reflect it
most faithfully because most simply, we may well be astonished
at the results obtained. Where we expected, perhaps, to find
only erudition, we reap a rich harvest of lessons which are all
the more valuable for being disinterested.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Legislative and administrative acts frequently develop real
economic doctrines. It is easy to discover in them the onward
course of a theory which plunges directly into practical applications.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What results might we not expect from these efforts, if the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page025">[pg 025]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg025"></a>
genius of investigation and of divination, which has so elevated
historical studies in our day, should have an observing
and penetrating eye in this direction! How limited was the
field on which Guérard erected the scientific monument which
he has left us in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Polyptique d'Irminon</span></span>; and how precious
are the lessons he leaves us, since we have here to do, not
with the history of professed doctrines or unlooked-for events,
but with the historical development of economic society which
shows us the living march of principles.

Political Economy is not, as we have just said, a new science.
It has been a distinct science only a short time. Until
the eighteenth century, it was confounded with philosophy,
morals, politics, law and history. But it does not follow, that,
because it has grown so in importance, as to deserve a place
of its own, its intimate relationship with the noble studies
which had until then absorbed it should cease. There is another
consequence also to be deduced from this. From the
moment that Political Economy ceases to be considered a new
science, it finds a long series of ancestors behind it, since it
is compelled to investigate a past to which so many bonds
unite it. This duty may increase its difficulties, but, at the same
time, it singularly adds to the attractions of a study which, instead
of presenting us only with the arid deductions of dogmatism,
comes to us with all the freshness and all the color of
life.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We may allow those who make Political Economy simply a
piece of arithmetic to ignore these retrospective studies and
their importance; for mathematics has little to do with history.
But it is otherwise with the life of nations. These
would discover whence they come, in order to learn whither
they are tending.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
They are not obeying a vain interest of curiosity, as J. B.
Say supposed, when, in sketching a short history of the progress
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page026">[pg 026]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg026"></a>
of Political Economy, he said: <span class="tei tei-q">“However, every kind
of history has a right to gratify curiosity.”</span> It is a thing to be
regretted, that this eminent thinker could thus ignore one of
the essential elements of the science to which he rendered
such great and unquestioned services. A sense for the historical
was wanting in him. <span class="tei tei-q">“The history of a science,”</span> he
writes,<a href="#note_25" id="noteref_25" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">25</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“is not like the narration of things that have happened.
What would it profit us to make a collection of absurd opinions,
of decried doctrines which deserved to be decried? It
would be at once useless and fastidious to thus exhume them
in case we perfectly knew the public economy of social bodies.
It can be of little concern to us to learn what our predecessors
have dreamed about this subject, and to describe the
long series of mistakes in practice which have retarded man's
progress in the research after truth. Error is a thing to be
forgotten, not learned.”</span> As if that which was once to be
found in time is not to-day to be found in space; as if there
ever was an institution that did not have its
<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">raison d' etre</span></span> and
had not constituted a resting place in the search after a higher
truth or of a more intelligent and salutary application of an old
one! There are a great many actual systems and a great
many present facts which can be understood only by the help
of history; and how frequently would not an acquaintance
with history serve to keep us from taking for marvelous inventions
the antiquated machinery of other ages, whose only
advantage and only merit are that they have remained unknown.
How much of the pretended daring of innovators has
been old trumpery which the wisdom of the times had cast
off as rubbish. Besides, as Bacon has said: <span class="tei tei-q">“Verumtamen

It is not the result of mere chance that the greatest economists
have been both historians and philosophers. We need
only mention Adam Smith, Turgot, Malthus, Sismondi, Droz,
Rossi and Léon Faucher. It is too frequently forgotten that
the father of modern Political Economy, Adam Smith, looked
upon the science as only one part of the course of moral philosophy
which he taught at Glasgow, and which embraced
four divisions:
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Universal theology.</span></span>—The existence and attributes of
God; principles or faculties of the human mind, the basis of
religion.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ethics.</span></span>—Theory of the moral sentiments.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Moral principles relating to justice.</span></span>—In
this, as we learn from one of Adam Smith's pupils in a sketch preserved by
David Stewart, he followed a plan which seems to have been
suggested to him by Montesquieu. He endeavored to trace the
successive advances of jurisprudence from the most barbarous
times to the most polished. He carefully showed how the
arts which minister to subsistence, and to the accumulation of
property, act on laws and governments, and are productive
of advances and changes in them analogous to those they experience
themselves.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the first part of his course, as we learn from the same
authority, he examined the various political regulations not
founded on the principle of justice but in expediency, the
object of which is to increase the wealth, the power and the
prosperity of the state. From this point of view, he considered
the political institutions relating to commerce, finance, the
ecclesiastical and military establishments. His lectures on the
different subjects constitute the substance of the work he afterwards
published on the wealth of nations. A pupil of Hutcheson,
Adam Smith always applied the experimental method,
<span class="tei tei-q">“which, instead of losing itself in magnificent and hazardous
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page028">[pg 028]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg028"></a>
speculations, attaches itself to certain and universal facts discovered
to us by our own consciousness, by language, literature,
history and society.”</span><a href="#note_26" id="noteref_26" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">26</span></span></a>
Before taking the professorship
of philosophy, Adam Smith had taught belleslettres and rhetoric
in Edinburgh, in 1748. He had written a work on the
origin and formation of languages; and it was because he had
profoundly studied the moral sciences that it was given to him
to inaugurate a new science and to become a great economist.
Mr. Cousin has laid great stress on Adam Smith's taste and
talent for history. <span class="tei tei-q">“Whatever the subject he treats, he turns
his eyes backward over the road traversed before himself, and
he illuminates every object on his path by the aid of the torch
which reflection has placed in his hand. Thus, in Political
Economy, his principles not only prepare the future but renew
the past, and discover the reason, heretofore unknown, of
ancient facts which history had gathered together without understanding
them. It is not saying enough to remark that
Adam Smith possessed a great variety of historical information;
we must add that he possessed the real historical spirit.”</span>
Thanks to this eminent faculty of his, the Glasgow philosopher
acquired great influence over minds. In 1810, when the
French empire had reached the zenith of its greatness, Marwitz
wrote: <span class="tei tei-q">“There is a monarch as powerful as Napoleon:
Adam Smith.”</span> We need not recall Turgot's historical researches.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Malthus' chief title to distinction, his work on Population,
is as much a historical work as a politico-economical one; and
it is not sufficiently known that he was professor of history
and Political Economy in the college of the East India Company
at Aylesbury.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We need say no more on this subject. The works of the
other writers whom we have mentioned are too well known
to permit any one to think that they excluded history and
moral science from the study of Political Economy. Hence
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page029">[pg 029]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg029"></a>
the school which has risen up in Germany,<a href="#note_27" id="noteref_27" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">27</span></span></a> and which is endeavoring
to do for Political Economy what Savigny, Eichhorn,
Schrader, Mommsen, Rudorff, and so many other illustrious
scholars have done for jurisprudence, cannot be rightly
accused of rashness. It has done nothing but unfurl the noble
banner borne by the most venerated masters of the science.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At the head of this school stands William Roscher, professor
of Political Economy at the University of Leipzig, whose
excellent work, The Principles of Political Economy, in which
he follows <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the historical method</span></em>, we have just translated.
William Roscher is (1857) scarcely forty years of age. He
was born at Hanover, October 21, 1817. His laborious
and simple life is that of a worthy representative of the science.
<span class="tei tei-q">“You ask me,”</span> he wrote us recently, <span class="tei tei-q">“to give you some information
concerning the incidents of my life. I have, thank
God, but very little to tell you. Lives whose history it is interesting
to relate are seldom happy lives.”</span> He confined
himself to giving us a few dates which are, so to say, the
landmarks of a career full of usefulness. Roscher, from 1835
to 1839, studied jurisprudence and philology at the universities
of Göttingen and Berlin. The learned teachers who exercised
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page030">[pg 030]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg030"></a>
the greatest influence on his intellectual development
were the historians Gervinus and Ranke, the philologist K. O.
Müller and the Germanist Albrecht. It is easy to see that he
went to a good school, and that he profited by it. He was
made doctor in 1838; admitted in 1840 as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Privat-docent</span></span> at
Göttingen; appointed in 1843 professor extraordinary at the
same university, and called in 1844 to fill the chair of titular
professor at Erlangen. Since 1848 he has acted in the same
capacity in the University of Leipzig, where he was for six
years member of the Poor Board, where he teaches also in the
agricultural college. His fame has grown rapidly. Many of
the German universities have emulated one another for the
honor of possessing him, but he has not been willing to leave
Leipzig. His first remarkable work was his doctor's thesis:
<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">De historicæ doctrinæ
apud sophistas majores vestigiis</span></span>, written
in 1838. In 1842, he published his excellent work, which has
since become classical: <span class="tei tei-q">“The Life, Labors and age of
Thucydides.”</span><a href="#note_28" id="noteref_28" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">28</span></span></a>
From that time, important works, all bearing the
stamp of varied and profound scientific acquirements, and of
an erudition remarkable for sagacity and elegance, have followed
one another without interruption. In 1843, he treated
the question of luxury<a href="#note_29" id="noteref_29" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">29</span></span></a>
with a master hand, and laid the foundation
of his great work—only the first part of which has
thus far appeared—at the same time tracing on a large scale
the programme of a course of Political Economy according
to the historical method.<a href="#note_30" id="noteref_30" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">30</span></span></a> In 1844, he published his historical
study on Socialism and Communism,<a href="#note_31" id="noteref_31" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">31</span></span></a> and in 1845 and 1846,
his ideas on the politics and the statistics of systems of agriculture.
He is, besides, author of an excellent work on the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page031">[pg 031]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg031"></a>
corn-trade;<a href="#note_32" id="noteref_32" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">32</span></span></a> of a remarkable book on the colonial
system;<a href="#note_33" id="noteref_33" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">33</span></span></a>

antiquity;<a href="#note_35" id="noteref_35" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">35</span></span></a> of

doctrines in England in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries—a
work full of the most curious researches;<a href="#note_36" id="noteref_36" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">36</span></span></a> of a book on

great work, the first part of which we have translated, under the
title of The Principles of Political Economy, and which is to
be completed by the successive publication of three other volumes,
on the Political Economy of Agriculture, and the related
branches of primitive production, the Political Economy of
Industry and Commerce, and one on the Political Economy of
the State and the Commune. This work, when completed,
will be a real cyclopedia of the
science.<a href="#note_38" id="noteref_38" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">38</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Side by side with William Roscher, we must mention a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page032">[pg 032]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg032"></a>
young economist, Knies, formerly professor at the University
of Marburg, but whom political persecution compelled to accept
a secondary position at the gymnasium of Schaffhausen,
for a time, and who fills, to-day, in the University of Freiburg,
in Breisgau, a position more worthy of his great talent. We
hope, in a work which we intend to publish, on Political
Economy in Germany, to make the public acquainted with the
works of this writer. They deserve to attract the most serious
attention. We know of few works which equal his Political
Economy, written on the historical method.<a href="#note_39" id="noteref_39" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">39</span></span></a> We shall
also have something to say of another economist, formerly
professor at Marburg, a victim, also, of the power of the
elector of Hesse, Hildebrand, now professor at the University
of Zurich. His National-Œkonomie<a href="#note_40" id="noteref_40" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">40</span></span></a> is a book replete
with interest, and we have nowhere met with a better criticism
of Proudhon's system, than in its pages. If the new
school had produced but these three men, it would still have
left its impress on the history of the science.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Other works, no less important, will claim our attention in
the book to which we have already devoted many years of
labor. If we carry out our intention, we shall review the
works of a great many scholars, of great merit, whose names
only are, unfortunately, known outside of Germany. The
works of Rau, of Hermann, of Robert Mohl, of Hannsen,
Helferich, Schütz, Kosegarten, Wirth etc., are a rich mine,
from which we hope to draw much valuable information.
Nor shall we neglect the original productions of J. Moser, the
Franklin of Germany, nor the quaint, but sometimes striking,
ideas of Adam Müller. Lastly, our learned friend, Professor
Stein of Vienna, will afford us an opportunity to show forth
the merit of important and extensive works, animated by the
philosophic spirit. For the present, we must confine ourselves
to a view of the application of the historical method to Political
Economy.

There is a rather widespread prejudice existing against this
order of works, a souvenir of the struggle carried on formerly,
between Thibaut and Savigny, which inclines people to suppose
that the historical school leans towards the political doctrines
of the past, and that it is hostile to the liberal spirit
of modern times. Nothing can be farther from the truth.
The names of Roscher, Knies and Hildebrand are sufficient to
remove this prejudice. Their works, inspired by an enlightened
love for progress, do not allow of such a misconstruction.
The historical point of view does not consist in the worship of
the past, any more than in the depreciation of the present. It
does not view the succession of phenomena as a fluctuation of
events without unity or purpose. On the contrary, the historical
method harmonizes wonderfully well with the wants of
genuine progress. The changes accomplished bear testimony
to the free and creative power of man, acting within the limit
permitted to it by the degrees of intelligence reached, of the
development of morals, and of individual liberty. The philosophy
of Political Economy, which is the result of this calm
teaching, free from the passions of party—for science acknowledges
no adherence to party—is like that of law, opposed
to the, more or less, ingenious or rash dreams, which
build the world over again in thought. In showing how, at
all times, humanity has understood and applied the principles
which govern the production of wealth, it may say, with the
Roman jurisconsult: <span class="tei tei-q">“Justitiam namque colimus ... æquum
ab iniquo separantes ... veram nisi fallor philosophiam, non
simulatam affectantes.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“The human mind,”</span> says Rossi,
<span class="tei tei-q">“endeavoring to attain to a knowledge of itself, estimating its
strength, taking a method, and applying it with a consciousness
of its mode of procedure to the knowledge of all things;
such is philosophy. Without it, there is no science in any
branch of human knowledge.”</span> Thus do we rise, with the aid
of a critical mind, by careful investigation and great sagacity,
to the truths founded on observations made.

There is another method, which, starting out from principles,
evident of themselves, develops science by way of
conclusions drawn, after the manner of the geometricians.
The apparent severity and simplicity of this method are very
seductive, and very dangerous, when we have to deal not with
figures, but with men; when the varied, complex and delicate
exigencies which accumulate when human nature comes into
play do not exactly square with the formula; and, when instead
of dealing with abstractions, we have to tackle realities.
One of our venerated teachers, the illustrious Rossi, thought
he might remove the difficulty by drawing a distinction between
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pure</span></em> Political Economy and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">applied</span></em> Political Economy.
It is not without a certain amount of hesitation that we dare
differ with so high an authority; but confess we must, this distinction
is far from satisfying us. The doubt it has left in our
mind has been the principal cause which has inclined us to
the historical method. <span class="tei tei-q">“Rational Political Economy,”</span> says
Rossi, <span class="tei tei-q">“is the science which investigates the nature, the causes
and the movement of wealth, by basing itself on the general
and constant facts of human nature, and of the external world.
In applied Political Economy, the science is taken as the mean.
Account is taken of external facts. Nationality, time and
place play an important part.”</span>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let us for a moment accept these definitions; what is the
consequence? That there are two sciences, the one of which,
purely speculative, has more to do with philosophy than with
the permanent conflicts which agitate the world; the other of
which could not alone furnish us with rules in practice, nor
with a formulary for the measures to be taken in a given
case, since such a pretension would be both vain and ridiculous,
but which would inform the practical judgment of men
charged with the solution of the numberless difficult and complicated
questions which come up every day. If pure science
refuses to interfere in the affairs of this world; if, as the learned
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page035">[pg 035]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg035"></a>
originator of the doctrine we are just now considering gives
us to understand, it would compromise the solution of questions
by the intoxication of logic, and the ambition of perfect
system; if, consequently, it is to be worshipped like a motionless
and inactive divinity, how could this platonic satisfaction
suffice us? Would not the opponents of economic doctrines
be disposed to acknowledge all the principles, provided
the consequences to be drawn from them were left to themselves;
and would they not come to us, bristling with arguments
drawn from the circumstances of nationality, time and
space, to refute the possibility of applying pure science?

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This, therefore, is the ground we must explore. We must
develop applied Political Economy which takes cognizance of
external circumstances. To do this, no one will question that
the best and most decisive of methods is the historical, which
concerns itself with time, space and nationality, and which
leads to proper reformation where reformation is wanted.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Moreover, principles will be no less firmly established by
historical induction than by dogmatic deduction, and, moreover,
science will be inseparable from art. We are not of
those who deny principles, or who challenge them. What
we desire is, that they should not be worshiped as fetiches,
but that they should enter into the very life-blood of nations.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Further: the abstract deductions of pure science do not
leave us without disquietude, since they treat man much more
like a material than like a moral force. Under the vigorous
procedure of speculative mathematics, man becomes a constant
quantity for all times and all countries, whereas he is, in reality,
a variable quantity. All the elements put in play are
ideal entities, the reverse of which we find in poetry, where

the sum of enjoyments which may be procured for him. We
must not run the risk of lowering him to the level of a living
tool; and from the moment that we are required to take his
moral destiny into account, what becomes of abstract calculation?

We have been wrong, says Rossi, in reproaching Quesnay
for his famous <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">laissez faire,
laissez passer</span></span>, which is pure science.
We, also, are of opinion that the reproach was ill
founded, for it proceeded from a wrong conception of the
principle itself. But it seems to us that, far from condemning
this doctrine in its serious application, the historical method
may serve to explain and to justify it. Employing less of
rigidity and dryness in form, it reaches consequences more in
harmony with social life. But it is not to be imagined that
we do not meet in this way with many ancient and glorious
precedents. The great principles of industrial liberty, as well
as those of commercial liberty, originated in France. Forbonnais
was right when he said: <span class="tei tei-q">“We may congratulate
ourselves on being able to find, in our old books and ancient
ordinances, wherewith to vindicate for ourselves the right to
that light which we generally supposed to have been revealed
to the English and Dutch before us.”</span> The further Forbonnais
carried his researches into our annals, the greater the number
of traces of opposition to the prejudices in favor of exclusion
and monopoly, so long made principles of administrative policy,
did he find.<a href="#note_41" id="noteref_41" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">41</span></span></a>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The famous axiom, <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">laissez
faire</span></span>, and <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">laissez
passer</span></span>, the subversive
tendencies of which people affect to condemn, was not
invented by Quesnay. He only gave a scientific bearing to
what was the inspiration of a merchant called Legendre.
The latter, consulted by Colbert on the best means of protecting
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page037">[pg 037]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg037"></a>
commerce, dropped these words which have since become
so celebrated.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We must not lose sight of their real meaning, nor misunderstand
the intention which dictated them. What Quesnay
said was this: <span class="tei tei-q">“Let everything alone which is injurious,
neither to good morals, nor to liberty, nor to property, nor to
personal security. Allow everything to be sold which has
been produced without crime.”</span> And he added: <span class="tei tei-q">“Only freedom
judges aright; only competition never sells too dear, and
always pays a reasonable and legitimate price.”</span> Far from
being the absence of rule, liberty is the rule itself. To
<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">laisser faire</span></span>
the good is to prevent evil.<a href="#note_42" id="noteref_42" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">42</span></span></a>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is need of institutions to complete the exercise of the
independence acquired by labor, and of laws to regulate that
exercise. The <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">laisser faire</span></span>
and <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">laisser passer</span></span> of economists
is, in no way, like the absolute formula, which some have denounced
and others sought to utilize, as relieving authority of
all care and all intervention.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To understand this maxim aright, we must go back to the
oppressive regime of ancient society. Quesnay's formula was,
first of all, a protest against the restraints which hampered the
free development of labor. But it did not tend to abrogate
the office of legislator, nor to deprive society or the individual
of the support of the public power which watches over the
fulfillment of our destiny.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It may have seemed convenient to find in the gravity of a
politico-economical principle, an excuse for the sweets of legislative
and administrative <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">far niente</span></span>,
but it is generally conceded
that the role of authority has grown, rather than diminished,
under the regime of the liberty of labor. The task is, in our
days, a hard one, both for individuals and nations; for liberty
dispenses its favors only to the masculine virtues of a laborious
and an enlightened people.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Liberty is not license. It refuses to bend under the yoke,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page038">[pg 038]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg038"></a>
but it submits to rule. The mission of authority is not to constrain,
but to counsel; not to command, but to help accomplish;
not to absorb individual activity, but to develop it. It
does not pretend to raise a convenient indifference on the part
of government, nor the indolent withdrawal of all protective
influence to the dignity of a principle. To say, on the other
hand, that the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">laisser
faire</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">laisser
passer</span></span> of the economists
means: Let robbery alone; let fraud alone etc., is to amuse
one's self playing upon words, and to argue in a manner unworthy
of any serious answer. Under pretext of painting a
picture of economic doctrine, we are given its caricature.
Such has never been the system, to the elaboration of which
the purest hearts and noblest intellects have devoted themselves.
A negation does not constitute the science of Political
Economy.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is very convenient to inclose humanity within a circle of
action, drawn with rigorous precision, and to govern movements
seen in advance. But such artificial conceptions mutilate
the activity of man. To guarantee man all liberty, and
prevent its abuse—such are the data of the problem. The
work is a great and difficult one. Far from yielding in point
of elevation to ideal systems, it is superior to them in extent
and variety of combinations. Those who ignore its bearing,
yield, it may be, to a certain indolence of intellect. Restrained
within its natural limits, the famous
<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">laisser faire</span></span>
and <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">laisser
passer</span></span> of the Physiocrates deserves even to-day our respect
and our confidence. It ought to be preserved in the grateful
memory of men, side by side with the maxim which Quesnay
succeeded in having printed at Versailles, by the hand of
Louis XV himself: <span class="tei tei-q">“Pauvres paysans, pauvre royaume;
pauvre royaume, pauvre souverain.”</span><a href="#note_43" id="noteref_43" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">43</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To return to the question of method. Rossi made use of
an ingenious example to explain his thought:<a href="#note_44" id="noteref_44" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">44</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“Are,”</span> he inquires,
<span class="tei tei-q">“these deductions [of pure science] perfectly legitimate;
are these consequences always true? It is incontestably true
that a projectile, discharged at a certain angle, will describe a
certain curve; this is a mathematical truth. It is equally true,
that the resistance offered to the projectile by the medium
through which it moves modifies the speculative result in
practice, to some extent; this is a truth of observation. Is the
mathematical deduction false? By no means; but it supposes
a vacuum. I hasten to acknowledge it. Speculative economy
also neglects certain facts and leaves certain resistances out of
account.”</span> Now, from the moment that we have to deal with
human interests, it is not possible to suppose a vacuum, to
neglect the most vulgar facts, and the most common instances
of resistance, nor to lose one's self in abstraction. The correctives
of applied Political Economy either may not wipe out this
original sin, or else they run great danger of covering up the
principles themselves. In ballistics, again, we may measure
the resistance which the medium in which we are obliged
to operate, makes the force of impulsion and the target both
obey the same law, and yield to the same process of calculation.
But is it thus when you touch upon man's innermost
and most sensitive part? Is there not danger that the hypotheses
may be deceitful, and that you may be accused of toiling
in a vacuum? We well know the solid reason that may be
opposed to sarcasm of this nature; but is it expedient to lay
one's self open to it?
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Moreover, the consequences are not great enough to warrant
us to expose ourselves to the danger. The principles of
pure science are very small in number. They might even, be
easily reduced to one, of which M. Cousin has been the eloquent
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page040">[pg 040]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg040"></a>
interpreter—human liberty. This liberty has no need
of Political Economy to shine with the luster of evidence;
nothing can prevail against it. We can prove that it is as
fecund as it is respectable; but if the science of wealth should
endeavor to demonstrate the contrary, the primordial bases
of society, liberty, property and the family would not be less
sacred nor less necessary, for they are the right of humanity.
They could not be put aside, even under pretext of any mechanism
which would claim to produce more.<a href="#note_45" id="noteref_45" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">45</span></span></a> These sovereign
principles of economy flow from the moral law, and they have
no reason to dread the power of facts, for the prosperity of nations
depends on the respect with which they are surrounded
and the guarantees by which they are protected.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We have spoken of the moral law; and, indeed, in our opinion,
it is impossible to banish it from the domain of public
economy. Any other point of view seems to us too narrow.
And when we see eminent men go astray in the pursuit of an
ideal which fails to take the human soul into account, and
which finds nothing but equations where there are feelings and
ideas, we cannot help thinking that they are unfaithful to the
thought of the founder of the science, Adam Smith. Man is
not simply a piece of machinery. He does not blindly submit
to external impulse. Rather is he himself, the greatest of impulses.
But to govern things, he must first learn to conquer
himself. Personal interest is the powerful motive which he
obeys. Man does not live alone, in a state of isolation, in the
world. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Væ soli!</span></span> He lives in society and profits by the relations
which he forms with other beings, intelligent like himself,
and for whom he has a natural feeling of sympathy.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The good that comes to them yields satisfaction to him, and
the evil that befalls them falls on him likewise. He cannot turn
back entirely upon his own personality. Besides his own interest,
he feels and shares another interest—the interest of all.
Personal interest is perfectly legitimate. The love of self cannot
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page041">[pg 041]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg041"></a>
be condemned. The Savior himself has enjoined us to love
our neighbor as ourselves. To love him more than ourselves
is a very high and beautiful virtue. It is the self-abnegation
which inspired Christian heroes. But heroism is rare, and cannot
be imposed, nor taken, as a rule. Personal interest is a
powerful stimulant, and the superior harmony of social relations
makes it contribute to the general good.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What must be condemned is a fatal deviation of this sentiment
which destroys its effect and narrows its actions. What
we need to prevent is the degeneration of personal interest into
an egotism which parches, instead of fertilizing, and which
compromises the future by the exclusive search after present
advantage; for egotism is short-sighted. On the other hand,
the broader and more generous feeling which inclines us to
sympathize with our fellow beings in their sorrows, and to
unite our destiny to theirs; that is, the feeling of the general
interest, has a limit too.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It would be falsified if it absorbed the individual; if it destroyed
the most powerful motive-force by drying up the abundant
source of activity; if it attacked moral energy by enervating
responsibility; if it extended the circle of results obtained
to such an extent that scarcely any one should feel the rebound.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The evil produced by egotism, that sad travesty of personal
interest, appears under a form quite as formidable when the
general interest takes the form of communism. The coöperation
of personal interest and of the general interest is always
necessary, both for individual profit and social advantage.
There is as much danger in annihilating the individual as in
exalting him. History furnishes us with memorable examples
of this. It does not allow us to go astray in the narrow ways
of a peevish and jealous personality, nor to lose ourselves in
the vague labyrinth of a chimerical and false communism.
The latter would destroy what constitutes the power and dignity
of man. It would wipe out the most prominent features
of his noble nature, by destroying the support of energy and
activity and the food of moral force.

But, we are told, Political Economy is only the science of
selfishness; Adam Smith is the prophet of individualism; grow
rich <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">per fas et nefas</span></span> is its ultimate teaching. Such a judgment
is evidence of much levity and little enlightenment.
How could the man who conceived the study of human interests
on so large a scale, the philosopher who acknowledged
Hutcheson as his master and gave his ideas a still more expansive
character, be the apostle of egotism; and how can the
science which he founded be its gospel? There is here an
error of fact and a defect of appreciation. Hutcheson had
based moral philosophy on the feeling which, according to
him, engendered all the other virtues, on benevolence, which
is disinterested, busied with the welfare of others, with the
public weal and the general interest. Adam Smith went further,
and sought to base it on a still more energetic feeling,
on sympathy.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first sentence of his Theory of the Moral Sentiments,
which is a full resumé of his theory, is as follows: <span class="tei tei-q">“How
selfish soever man may be supposed, there are evidently some
principles in his nature which interest him in the fortune of
others, and render their happiness necessary to him, though
he derives nothing from it, except the pleasure of seeing it.”</span>
And this is no empty declaration on his part. It is the thought
which of all in his book is nearest to his heart; and hence he
energetically assails those philosophers who look upon self-love
and the refinements of self-love as the universal cause of
all our sentiments, and seek to explain sympathy by self-love.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
La Rochefoucauld, Mandeville and Helvetius never met
with a more determined or energetic adversary. Nowhere
have the sweet and amiable virtues, such as ingenuous condescension,
indulgent humanity, and the respectable and severe
virtues, such as disinterestedness and self-control which subject
our movements to the requirements of the dignity of our
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page043">[pg 043]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg043"></a>
nature, been better understood or interpreted. Adam Smith
is the philosopher of sympathy.<a href="#note_46" id="noteref_46" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">46</span></span></a> His theory triumphs over
the cowardly and shameful egotism which concentrates the
moral life of the individual in himself, and separates it from
the life of the human race of the
<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">outré</span></span> stoicism which refuses
the aid of sentiment to reason.<a href="#note_47" id="noteref_47" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">47</span></span></a> According to him, the law
of private morals is sympathy; the law of natural jurisprudence,
justice; the law of the production of wealth, free labor.
But while he defended this principle with energy, he did not
become guilty of a real recantation by worshiping the idol he
had just overthrown. He would have been culpable of the
strangest of all contradictions if he had made the vice which
he had just lacerated the very pivot of another part of his
teaching.

What is there that political economists have not been charged
with? They have been accused, above all, of a cold heartedness
and cruelty, and the sentence passed on them has been
resumed in these words: <span class="tei tei-q">“Political Economy has no bowels!”</span>
Indeed, the representative of the science, who has been most
attacked and who has been held up as a picture of impassible
insensibility; on whom have been heaped the most bloody outrages,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page044">[pg 044]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg044"></a>
is Malthus. Let us hear him. He tells us in his work
on Political Economy, that if a country had no other means
to grow rich, except by seeking for success in the struggle
with other countries, at the cost of a reduction of the wages of
labor, he would unhesitatingly say: Away with such riches;
that it is much to be desired that the working classes should
be well remunerated, and this for a reason much more important
than all the considerations relating to wealth; that is, the
happiness of the great mass of society. And he goes on to
say, that he knows nothing more detestable than the idea of
knowingly condemning the laboring classes to cover themselves
with rags, to lodge in wretched huts, to enable us to
sell a few more stuffs and calicoes to foreign countries. Certain
it is, that no defender, however determined, of the laboring
classes, has said anything stronger or more deeply felt. The
reason is, that nothing was more foreign to Malthus' ideas
than the systematic rigidity of mathematical theories of wealth;
that, a minister of the Gospel, he had meditated on its high
precepts. His whole doctrine is based on the moral idea.
<span class="tei tei-q">“He was profoundly convinced that there are principles in
Political Economy which are true only in as far as they are
restricted within certain limits. He saw the principal difficulty
of the science in the frequent combination of complicated
causes, in the action and reaction of causes on one another,
and in the necessity of setting limits or making exceptions to a
great number of important propositions.”</span> Here we are ever
brought back to the undulating ground of living science, instead
of having to follow the rectilineal way traced out by the dead
letter. We are always driven back, whatever may be pretended
to the contrary, to the realities of which history alone
possesses the secret. The idea of wealth cannot absorb everything
when there is question of judging and enlightening men.
To do this, it is necessary to know the various phases of social
housekeeping, what nations have thought of economic interests
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page045">[pg 045]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg045"></a>
which have never ceased to interest them greatly, what they
have attempted and what they have attained.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Hence, we must turn over the leaves of the book of the past,
and study its economic aspect, as we have studied its political
and literary aspect. We must follow living nations through
their divers periods of development, and fathom the causes of
the destruction of those that are dead. When we are dealing
with the comparative study of the economic destinies of nations,
our investigations are limited to a small number of individual
nations—a further reason not to omit any, and above
all, to scrutinize, as an anatomist would with his scalpel, the
principle of life of those which are no more. We may, by
accounting to ourselves for the immense variety of phenomena
which are brought to light by the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">application</span></em> of principles to
facts, and in which nothing is absolute or permanent, in which,
on the contrary, everything is relative and successive, acquire
that sureness of touch and correctness of vision which are
among the most valuable conquests of science.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It would be a mistake to suppose that theory simplifies practical
solutions. Far from providing us with a sort of formulary,
it teaches us to put our finger on a number of difficulties.
It brings to the surface the many aspects and fertile and varied
considerations, the examination of which is the mission of the
real statesman and legislator. In this way, the action of thought
and the power of the moral idea are revealed with most <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">éclat</span></span>.
Man ceases to be an inert element, and manifests himself as a
sensible being, and the sublime thought of Pascal: <span class="tei tei-q">“Humanity
is like one man who lives and learns always,”</span> is verified by
the result. The wish to violently abdicate the past, it would
be vain and rash to attempt to realize. The lessons it transmits
to us are as instructive as the picture it unrolls before our
eyes is attractive. We have no longer but to see and hear, to
be cured of the most generous impatience with what is, and to
retreat from the most perilous attempts.

The unvarying testimony of ages affirms the continued and
gradual amelioration of man by individual energy and moral
thought.<a href="#note_48" id="noteref_48" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">48</span></span></a> Want and suffering have urged him forward.
Foresight, labor, sacrifice and virtue have in part redeemed
him. No right has been lessened or usurped, and every step
in civilization has been a step in the way of freedom. Instead
of making the latter responsible for a material and moral
wretchedness which it is called upon to cure, we may prove,
that, in proportion as real liberty and legal guarantees increase,
evil diminishes.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We do not desire to yield to a convenient optimism, and deny
the sufferings which weigh only too heavily on the world.
We are far from having reached the end assigned to our efforts;
but let not the hope we entertain of further progress blind
us to that which has already been accomplished. This latter
shows us that we are on the right road, and that we have not
done unwisely in giving free rein to the human faculties.
Sudden changes are made only in theaters. In the real world,
the march of progress is slow and laborious. It may be accelerated
by a happy hit; but it would be vain to try to hurry it.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Man still suffers. No one desires to deny the evil, but only
to estimate its extent. Yet it cannot be gainsaid that its fatal
empire is narrowing instead of enlarging. Especially is it the
progress accomplished in the higher regions of intellect and of
the feelings which here exerts its beneficent influence. On
our moral greatness depends our material power. The elevation
or debasement of character, the energy or debility of
the will—such is the first source of good or evil. The world,
a Chalmers rightly says, is so constituted that we should be
materially happy if we were morally good.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Industrial progress helps, we have said, towards moral perfection.
It is not the source of that perfection, but its instrument;

for ignorance and misery, its habitual attendants, are
poor advisers. Political Economy shows how the goods of
this world are multiplied. It shows how modest comfort may
become more and more general, and thus an impetus be given
to all noble virtues without awakening a blind passion for riches.
It teaches moderation instead of exciting covetousness, nor
does it come in conflict with the sublime words of Saint Augustine:
<span class="tei tei-q">“The family of men, living by faith, use the goods of the
earth as strangers here, not to be captivated by them or turned
away by them from the goal to which they tend, which is God,
but to find in them a support which, far from aggravating,
lightens the burthen of this perishable body which weighs
down the soul.”</span>

Looked at from below, all things diverge. Looked at from
above, all things run into one another and combine with one
another. It is one of the great merits of the historical method,
that it raises the point of observation and gives the observer
the support of tradition and good sense, that master of life;
that it prevents a divorce between different branches of knowledge
of the same order, which constitute but one intellectual
family, which there is no question of confounding, and which
it would be dangerous to isolate.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Aristotle, that universal genius, had discovered Political
Economy, and it was the historical method which revealed it to
him. Be it added, that the great philosopher had seen but
one phase of the science, chrematistics, and that his ideas here
bear the impress of the age in which he lived. Aristotle,
however, distinguished this science from all others and from
domestic economy, which is so akin to it. Doubtless, he did
not found the modern study of Political Economy, but his
powerful intellect gave him a presentiment of it.

The honor of producing at once, Adam Smith, Quesnay and
Turgot belongs to the eighteenth century. It was in the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page048">[pg 048]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg048"></a>
course of philosophy at Glasgow that this study found a definite
place. The illustrious founder of the science of Political
Economy did not contemplate dissolving the ancient alliance
between it and the moral sciences, history, philosophy, jurisprudence,
belles-lettres—all of which he had explored and
studied profoundly. Let those whose ambition it is to walk,
even at a distance, in the footsteps of Adam Smith, not forget
what was the cradle of the noble study to which they have
devoted their intellects.

is Man.<a href="#note_49" id="noteref_49" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">49</span></span></a>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Every man has numberless wants, physical and intellectual.<a href="#note_50" id="noteref_50" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">50</span></span></a><a href="#note_51" id="noteref_51" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">51</span></span></a>
Wants are either necessaries, decencies
(<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">Anstandsbedürfnisse</span></span>)
or luxuries. The non-satisfaction of necessary wants causes
disease or death; that of the wants of decency endangers one's
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page052">[pg 052]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg052"></a>
social position.<a href="#note_52" id="noteref_52" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">52</span></span></a> The much greater number, and the longer
continuance of his wants are among the most striking differences
between man and the brute:<a href="#note_53" id="noteref_53" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">53</span></span></a> wants such as clothing,
fuel,<a href="#note_54" id="noteref_54" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">54</span></span></a> tools, and those resulting
from his much longer period
of infancy; which last, together with other causes, has contributed
so largely to make marriage necessary and universal.
While the lower animals have no wants, but necessities, and
while their aggregate-want, even in the longest series of
generations, admits of no qualitative increase, the circle of
man's wants is susceptible of indefinite extension.<a href="#note_55" id="noteref_55" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">55</span></span></a> And,
indeed, every advance in culture made by man finds expression
in an increase in the number and in the keenness of his
rational wants. No man who distinguishes himself in anything,
but feels spurred thereto by a peculiar want; and this
want is both the cause and the effect of the power which is
peculiar to him. No one but the poet feels the want of poetizing;
no one but the philosopher, of philosophizing. In
every particular, intellectual or physical, in which the man is
in advance of the child, he experiences new wants unknown
to the child. Our education consists, for the most part, in
awakening wants and providing for their satisfaction.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Goods are anything which can be used, whether directly or
indirectly, for the satisfaction of any true<a href="#note_56" id="noteref_56" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">56</span></span></a>
or legitimate human want,<a href="#note_57" id="noteref_57" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">57</span></span></a> and whose utility, for this purpose, is recognized.
Hence, the idea goods is an essentially relative one. Every
change in man's wants, or knowledge, is accompanied by a
rapid, corresponding change, either in the limits of the circle<a href="#note_58" id="noteref_58" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">58</span></span></a>
of goods, or in their relative importance. Thus, the tobacco plant
has, probably, existed thousands of years. It became goods,
however, only from the time that man recognized its use for
smoking, snuffing etc., and experienced the want of it for these
purposes. In a similar way, the limestone of the Solenhofen
quarries has become <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">goods</span></em>, of considerable importance, only
since the invention of lithography; decaying bones, only since
that of bone-dust manure; caoutchouc since about 1825, and
gutta-percha, only since 1844. On the other hand, charms,<a href="#note_59" id="noteref_59" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">59</span></span></a>
philters, and even relics, since the decay of faith in their efficacy,
have lost the quality of goods. If the aggregate income
of all mankind were, by some sudden revolution, to be
equally divided among all, diamonds, for instance, would
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page054">[pg 054]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg054"></a>
greatly decline in value, for the reason that it is dependent, in
great part, on the wants generated by vanity, or by the desire
of outshining others. Beer, tobacco etc., would rise in the
scale as goods, because the circle of those to whose wants
they minister would have been very greatly extended. On
the whole, advancement in civilization has uniformly the effect,
of itself, to increase the quantity and number of goods, the
wants and knowledge of men being thereby increased. We
should reach the ideal here, if all men experienced only true
or legitimate wants, but these completely; if they could see
their way, clearly, to the satisfaction of them, and find the
means of satisfying them with just the amount of effort most
conducive to their physico-intellectual development.<a href="#note_60" id="noteref_60" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">60</span></span></a>

The greater the advance of civilization or human culture,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page055">[pg 055]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg055"></a>
the less apt are men to pursue the satisfaction of their
wants, isolated from their fellows, or, in other words, to carry
on their economies or husbandries apart from one another.
The more numerous the wants of men, and the more different
in kind their faculties are, the more natural does exchange<a href="#note_63" id="noteref_63" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">63</span></span></a> become.
Since all goods derive their character as goods from
the fact that they are destined to satisfy human wants, the
very possibility of exchange must greatly increase the possibility
of things to become goods. Think of the machinist,
whose products are used only by the astronomer, while the
latter is never in a way to manufacture them for himself.
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hufeland.</span></span>) Commerce is the series of combinations, created

which wants and services are ever weaving and unweaving.”</span>
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hermann.</span></span>) As a rule, with an advance in civilization, there
is an increase in the number of goods, which become economic
goods, and in the number of economic goods which become
commercial goods (objects or means promotive of commerce).<a href="#note_64" id="noteref_64" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">64</span></span></a>
But this is to be considered a real advancement only to the
extent that that which is obtained is superior to that which
was possessed before, in consequence of the specialization of
callings or the greater division of labor (§ <a class="tei tei-ref pginternal" href="#Section_48">48</a> ff.).

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The economic value of goods is the importance they possess
for the purposes of man, considered as engaged in economy
(housekeeping, husbandry.<a href="#note_73" id="noteref_73" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">73</span></span></a>)
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Looked at from the point of view of the person who wishes
to employ them in his use directly, doubtless the oldest point of
view, value appears first as value in use; and here, according
to the difference of subjective purposes it is intended to subserve,
we may speak of production value or enjoyment-value;
and of this last, in turn, as utilization-value, or consumption-value.
The value in use of goods, is greater in proportion as
the number of wants they are calculated to satisfy are more general
and more urgent, and in proportion as they are gratified
by them more fully, surely, durably, easily and
pleasantly.<a href="#note_74" id="noteref_74" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">74</span></span></a>
Hence, it is seldom possible to find an accurate mathematical
expression of the relation which exists between the value in
use of different goods.<a href="#note_75" id="noteref_75" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">75</span></span></a>
Thus, it is possible to estimate the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page060">[pg 060]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg060"></a>
nutritive power of different kinds of goods, the value of wheat
or of hay for instance, but not the goodness or quality of their
taste, of the attractiveness of their appearance, etc.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But, the more men become used to comparing the aggregate
of human wants, and the aggregate of the goods which minister
to the satisfaction of these wants, as if they were two great
wholes, gradually shading each into the other, the more does
the value in use of the different kinds of goods assume, for
purposes of social rating or estimation, a fungible character.<a href="#note_76" id="noteref_76" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">76</span></span></a>
If a new kind of goods be produced or discovered, which satisfies
the same wants in a more complete manner than another,
the latter, although it has suffered no change, generally
loses in the value put upon it, especially if the new goods can
be produced in any desired quantity. An instance of this is
the change effected in the value of the dyers weed, woad, by
the introduction of indigo.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Things present in quantities greater than the amount
necessary to supply the want they satisfy, preserve their full
value in use, to the limit of that want, after which they are
simply an element of possible future value, dependent on an
increase of the want; but they have no value for present
use.<a href="#note_77" id="noteref_77" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">77</span></span></a>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The economic valuation of goods, however, is by no
means exhausted, so far as the isolated individual housekeeper
is concerned, by the mere establishing of its value in
use. As the systematic effort of every rational individual in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page061">[pg 061]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg061"></a>
his household management is directed towards the obtaining,
by a minimum of sacrifice of pleasure and energy, a maximum
satisfaction of his wants, even an Adam or a Crusoe is,
in his economy, compelled to estimate not only what the goods
to be acquired accomplish (value in use) but also what they
will cost—cost-value. Even the most indispensable kind of
goods, for instance atmospheric air, is considered to have no
value, when it can be obtained in sufficient quantity, without
any sacrifice whatever.<a href="#note_78" id="noteref_78" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">78</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The value in exchange of goods, or the quality which makes
them exchangeable against other goods, is based on a combination
of their value in use with their cost-value, such as men
in their intercourse with one another will make.<a href="#note_79" id="noteref_79" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">79</span></span></a> Without

</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But there are many, and even indispensable goods which
are not at all susceptible of being exchanged; for instance,
the light and heat of the sun, the open sea etc.<a href="#note_81" id="noteref_81" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">81</span></span></a> Other goods,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page062">[pg 062]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg062"></a>
although capable of being exchanged, have no value in exchange,
because they exist in superabundance, and may be
obtained by everyone, without trouble and without reward;
for instance, drinking-water in most places, ice in winter, and
wood in the primeval forest.<a href="#note_82" id="noteref_82" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">82</span></span></a>
Moreover, the idea of such
<span class="tei tei-q">“free goods”</span> is in great part relative. The water of a river
may, for drinking purposes, be <span class="tei tei-q">“free”</span> goods, and yet, for purposes
of irrigation, have great value in exchange. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">John
Stuart Mill</span></span>).
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But, goods, to obtain value in exchange, must, in addition to
their value in use, a value which must be recognized<a href="#note_83" id="noteref_83" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">83</span></span></a> by

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Recent, and especially socialistic,<a href="#note_85" id="noteref_85" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">85</span></span></a> writers have alluded to
the great <span class="tei tei-q">“contradiction”</span> between value in use and value in
exchange. This contradiction, however, vanishes when the
above idea of economy, and the two sides or aspects, which
economic value presents, are kept steadily in view. It is said,
for instance, that a pound of gold has a much greater value in
exchange than a pound of iron; while the value in use of
iron, is incomparably greater than that of gold. I question
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page064">[pg 064]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg064"></a>
this latter statement. True it is, that the need of iron is much
more universal and urgent than the need of gold. On the
other hand, a pound of gold yields satisfaction to the want of
that metal, much greater than is yielded by a pound of iron, to
the want of iron. We may speak of a contradiction between
value in use and value in exchange, at the farthest, only in case
the existing quantity of an article in trade, which can be done
without, is not estimated correspondingly lower than the whole
existing supply of a thing which is indispensable. But this is
a case which cannot often occur. When, for instance, wheat is
very dear, as in years of scarcity, people prefer to pay a very
high price for it rather than to dispense, even in part, with its
use; and so of all the necessaries of life. As people progress
in economic culture, they become more expert in adapting the
value in exchange of related goods, not only to their cost-value,
but also to their value in use.<a href="#note_86" id="noteref_86" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">86</span></span></a><a href="#note_87" id="noteref_87" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">87</span></span></a>

The lower the state of a nation's economy, the more isolated
men live from one another, the greater is the prominence given
by them to value in use, as compared with value in exchange,
a fact which makes a valuation of resources, which shall be
universally applicable, a more difficult matter.<a href="#note_88" id="noteref_88" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">88</span></span></a><a href="#note_89" id="noteref_89" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">89</span></span></a><a href="#note_90" id="noteref_90" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">90</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It has often been made a question, whether the valuation of
resources should be based on the value in use, or the value in exchange
of their constituent parts.<a href="#note_92" id="noteref_92" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">92</span></span></a>
The latter has, of course,
no interest, except in so far as we are concerned with the possibility
of obtaining the control of part of the resources, or
means, of another, by the surrender of a part of one's own
goods. In estimating the value of private resources, which
require to be made continually an object of trade, this point is,
of course, of the greatest importance. If certain of their component
elements, lands, for instance, belonging to a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">fidei commissum</span></span>,
are incapable of entering immediately into the market,
at least the revenue they yield is measured by its value in exchange.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is quite otherwise, even with the resources of a whole
nation. Such resources are, evidently, much more independent,
and have much less need of being exchanged against
their equals, than private resources. The foreign commerce,
of the greatest and most advanced nations, has, hitherto, been
but a small quota of their internal commerce.<a href="#note_93" id="noteref_93" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">93</span></span></a> A valuation,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page067">[pg 067]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg067"></a>
therefore, based on value in exchange, however interesting it
might be to enable us to determine how property is shared by
the different classes and persons that compose the nation,
would afford but little information concerning the absolute
amount of the national wealth. This, of course, applies in a
much higher degree to the resources of the whole world.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If, now, we were to estimate the resources of an entire
people, or even of the world, by summing up the value in exchange
of their several component parts, many very important
elements would be left out of the account entirely; as for instance,
harbors, navigable streams, numberless relations which
have, indeed, no value in exchange whatever, but which are
of the highest importance, because promotive of the economy
of the nation. The same may be said of made roads of every
description, the politico-economical value of which may be
much greater than the value in exchange of their stock, than
their cost of production etc. The increase of the value in
exchange of any of the branches of the resources of a
physical or legal person contributes towards really enriching
the nation or the world, only in case that the increased
value in exchange is based on an increased utility in quality
or quantity. Should an earthquake suddenly dry up a
number of our springs, and thus give value in exchange to
the drinking water from the remaining ones, we should, indeed,
witness the introduction of a new object into the list of
exchangeable goods; the owners of springs would be able to
command a larger portion of the national resources, but at the
expense of the rest of the population; and the whole country
would have become poorer in goods by the catastrophe. Even
the value in exchange of the national resources would not be
increased; for all other goods, which, hitherto, as compared
with water, had an unlimited capacity for exchange, would
lose just as much of that capacity as water had gained, as
compared with them.<a href="#note_94" id="noteref_94" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">94</span></span></a>
On the other hand, if a new mineral
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page068">[pg 068]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg068"></a>
spring should be discovered, the great value in use of the
water of which gave it value in exchange, the resources of the
nation would be really increased, not only in point of utility,
but in exchange value; for no other goods, formerly known,
would, in consequence of the discovery, lose in their exchange
power.<a href="#note_95" id="noteref_95" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">95</span></span></a>

The possession of large and also of potentially lasting resources;
objectively, such resources themselves, we call wealth.
But it must be large in a two-fold sense; large as compared with
the rational wants of its possessor, and large, also, as compared
with the resources of other people, especially with the resources
of those in the same condition of life. To be called rich, it
is not enough <span class="tei tei-q">“to have a sufficiency,”</span> (the individual side); it
is necessary to have more than
others.<a href="#note_96" id="noteref_96" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">96</span></span></a> If all men were possessed

We should have a very imperfect idea of the wealth of a
people (§ <a class="tei tei-ref pginternal" href="#Section_8">8</a>) if we should estimate it at the value in
exchange
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page071">[pg 071]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg071"></a>
of the sum<a href="#note_99" id="noteref_99" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">99</span></span></a>-total of the component parts of
the national resources.
By the following signs, however, an approximative
notion of the value in use of the resources of a nation may be
obtained:
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A. When, even the lower classes, who compose everywhere
the greatest portion of the people, are comfortable, in a condition
worthy of human beings. Thus, C. Dupin is surprised
at the great quantities of meat, butter, cheese and tea entered
on the accounts of the poor-houses in England, and the great
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page072">[pg 072]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg072"></a>
care taken to have these of the best quality.<a href="#note_100" id="noteref_100" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">100</span></span></a>
A good symptom of such a state of things is a high average duration of
human life, especially when there is a relatively large number
of births. (§ 246.)
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
B. When a considerable outlay, devoted to the satisfaction
of the more refined wants, is voluntarily made, and by
those only possessed of a proper economic sense. Thus, in
England, the various mission, bible, and tract societies had,
in 1841, an aggregate income of £630,000. The expeditions
in search of Franklin cost over a million pounds sterling. The
state outlay also belongs to this category, provided, that taxes
are collected and loans obtained, without any noticeable oppression.
The sum of 20,000,000 pounds sterling, voted, in
1833, by the British Parliament for the abolition of slavery, is
one of the happiest signs of the national wealth of England.<a href="#note_101" id="noteref_101" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">101</span></span></a>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
C. A large number of valuable buildings, and permanent
improvements; for instance, roads of every description, works
for purposes of irrigation and drainage. Thus, in London,
from September, 1843, to September, 1845, there were constructed
squares and streets with an aggregate length of 11.1
geographical miles. The number of newly built houses in
London, between 1843 and 1847, was nearly 27,000. And so,
in England and Wales there are 492 geographical miles of
navigable canals, while their navigable rivers are estimated to
have a length of only 449 miles. The number of miles of
railroad, in the British Empire, in 1865, was 2,897 geographical
miles, and they cost 459 million of pounds; in 1870, it was
3,270 geographical miles, at an aggregate cost of 650 millions
sterling.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
D. The frequent occurrence of heavy commercial payments,
which finds expression especially in the magnitude and costliness
of the most usual medium of exchange. Thus, all payments
are made in England in paper (for sums of at least five
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page073">[pg 073]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg073"></a>
pounds sterling) or in gold coin. Silver is used only as small
change, like copper in most other countries. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Infra</span></span>, §
<a class="tei tei-ref pginternal" href="#Section_118">118</a>,
seq.)<a href="#note_102" id="noteref_102" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">102</span></span></a>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
E. Frequent loans to foreign nations. Hence, Storch divides

All normal economy<a href="#note_104" id="noteref_104" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">104</span></span></a>
(husbandry) aims at securing a maximum of personal advantage with a minimum of cost or
outlay.<a href="#note_105" id="noteref_105" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">105</span></span></a> And there are always two intellectual incentives at the
foundation of this economy. There is, first, self-interest, the
positive manifestation of which is the effort to acquire as much
of the world's goods as possible, and the negative expression
of which, the effort to lose as little of them as
possible—acquisitiveness—saving. Self-interest, losing its moral, and
assuming a guilty, character, degenerates into egotism; acquisitiveness,
into covetousness; and the disposition to save, into
avarice—the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">solipsismus</span></span> of Kant. The incentive to ameliorate
one's condition is common to all men, no matter how varied
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page074">[pg 074]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg074"></a>
the form or different the intensity of its manifestation. It
guides us all from the cradle to the grave. It may be restricted
within certain limits, but never entirely extinguished.
It is, in the domain of economy, what the instinct of self-preservation
is to our physical existence, a powerful principle of
creation, preservation and of renewed life (I. Thessal., 4, 11,
seq.).<a href="#note_106" id="noteref_106" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">106</span></span></a> Then there is the incentive of the demand of God's
voice within us, the voice of conscience, whether we call it, in
philosophic outline <span class="tei tei-q">“the adumbration of the ideas of equity,
right, benevolence, of perfection and inner freedom,”</span> or, framing
our lives in accordance with them, the striving after the
Kingdom of God.<a href="#note_107" id="noteref_107" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">107</span></span></a> It matters not, how much the image of
God may have been disfigured in most men, there is no one
in whom the longing for it has so far disappeared as to leave
no trace behind. This puts bounds to our self-interest, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page075">[pg 075]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg075"></a>
transmutes it into an earthly means to enable us to approximate
to an eternal ideal.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As, in the structure of the world, the apparently opposing
tendencies of the centrifugal and centripetal forces produce
the harmony of the spheres, so, in the social life of man, self-interest
and conscience produce in him the feeling for the common
good.<a href="#note_108" id="noteref_108" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">108</span></span></a> This sentiment of the common interest is the
foundation on which rise in successive gradation, the life of
the family, of the community, of the nation and of humanity,
the last of which should be coincident with the life of the
Church. It, alone, can realize the kingdom of heaven on earth.
Through this sentiment alone can religion be made active and
moral. Only through it, can self-interest be made really sure
and always to the purpose. Even the most calculating mind
must acknowledge, that numberless institutions, relations etc.,
are useful and even necessary to many individuals, which can
be established or maintained only from a sense of the general
welfare, for the reason that no one individual could make the
sacrifice required to establish or maintain them. And so, since
commerce has wrought the interests of all men into one great
piece of net-work, the best means of obtaining wherewith to
satisfy our own wants is to help others satisfy theirs. Self-interest
causes every one to choose the course in life in which
he shall meet with the least competition and the most abundant
patronage; in other words, that which answers to the most
pressing and least satisfied want of the community. As a rule,
the physician who cures the greatest number of patients with
the greatest skill, and the manufacturer who produces the
best goods cheapest, will grow to be the richest. It is, moreover,
easy to see that, according as the circle of common interests
grows smaller, it approximates to self-interest; and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page076">[pg 076]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg076"></a>
to <span class="tei tei-q">“the Kingdom of God”</span><a href="#note_109" id="noteref_109" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">109</span></span></a> as it grows larger. And yet, all
these circles respectively condition one another. Cosmopolitanism
or church-zeal, without love of country; patriotism,
without fidelity to the community in which one lives, or love
of one's family, are more than suspicious. The reverse is
also true. This is a chief connecting link between the great
apparent opposites.<a href="#note_110" id="noteref_110" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">110</span></span></a><a href="#note_111" id="noteref_111" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">111</span></span></a>

society. On it are based the various forms of economy in

</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Although the higher science of Political Economy has,
nearly always, been conceived<a href="#note_114" id="noteref_114" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">114</span></span></a> as treating of the aggregate
national activity of a people, there have been many, recently,
who consider Political Economy as no real whole, but only as
a mere abstraction. This is true, especially of many unconditional
free-trade theorizers, partly from a repugnance toward
the governmental guardianship of private businesses or economy.
It is true, also, of certain philosophers who consider
the idea, <span class="tei tei-q">“the people,”</span> as merely nominal.<a href="#note_115" id="noteref_115" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">115</span></span></a> There are, however,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page079">[pg 079]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg079"></a>
two things necessary to warrant us to call a thing made
up of a number of parts, one real whole: the parts and the
whole must have a reciprocal action upon one another, and the
whole, as such, must have a demonstrable action of its own.
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Drobisch.</span></span>) In this sense, <span class="tei tei-q">“the people”</span> is, unquestionably, a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page080">[pg 080]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg080"></a>
reality, and not alone the individuals who constitute the <span class="tei tei-q">“people.”</span>
Besides, it is truly said that all husbandry or economy
supposes a will (<span class="tei tei-q">“systematized activity”</span> etc., <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">supra</span></span>, §
<a class="tei tei-ref pginternal" href="#Section_2">2</a>).
Such a will is ascribed to individuals, to legal persons, to the
state, but not, however, to <span class="tei tei-q">“the people,”</span> as a whole. But this
will need not be an entirely conscious one, as is plain from the
case of the less gifted and less cultured individuals engaged in
household economy. The systemization in the public economy
of a people finds its clearest expression in economic laws,
and in the institutions of the state. But it finds expression,
also, without the intervention of the state, in the laws established
by use, and by the opinions of jurists or courts, in community
of speech, of customs and tastes etc.: things which
have an important economic meaning, which depend on the
common nature of the land, of race and history, and which
influence the state, at least as much as they are influenced
by it.<a href="#note_116" id="noteref_116" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">116</span></span></a><a href="#note_117" id="noteref_117" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">117</span></span></a>

The most that can be said, at present, so far as an economy
of mankind, or a world-economy, is concerned, is, that it may
be shown that important preparations have been made for it.
We are approaching more nearly to it by the ways of the
more and more cosmopolitan character of science, the increasing
international coöperation of labor, the improvement in the
means of transportation, growing emigration, the greater love
of peace, and the greater toleration of nations etc.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The idea conveyed by the word <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">organism</span></span>, is doubtless, one
of the most obscure of all ideas; and I am so far from desiring
to explain<a href="#note_118" id="noteref_118" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">118</span></span></a> by that idea, the meaning of public or national
economy, that I would only use the word <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">organism</span></span> as
the shortest and most familiar expression of a number of
problems, which it is the purpose of the following investigation
to solve.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There are two points, especially, of importance here. In the
motion of any machine, it is possible to distinguish with the
utmost accuracy, between the cause and the effect of the motion:
the blowing of the wind, for instance, is simply and purely,
the cause of the friction of the mill-stones in a wind-mill,
and is not in the least influenced or conditioned by the latter.
But, in the public economy of every people, patient thought
soon shows the observer, that the most important simultaneous
events or phenomena mutually condition one another. Thus,
a flourishing state of agriculture is impossible without flourishing
industries; but, conversely, the prosperity of the latter
supposes the prosperity of the former, as a condition precedent.
It is as in the human body. The motions of respiration are
produced by the action of the spinal cord; and the spinal
cord, in turn, continues to work only through the blood, that is,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page082">[pg 082]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg082"></a>
by the help of respiration. In all cases like this, we are forced,
when accounting for phenomena, to move about in a circle, unless
we admit the existence of an organic life, of which every
individual fact is only the manifestation.<a href="#note_119" id="noteref_119" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">119</span></span></a><a href="#note_120" id="noteref_120" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">120</span></span></a>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is, also, undeniable, that human insight into the operation
and utility of a machine must always precede the existence of
the machine itself. This human insight is parent to the plan,
and the plan, in turn, is parent to the machine. The very reverse
of this is true in the case of organisms, those <span class="tei tei-q">“divine
machines”</span> as Leibnitz called them. Men had digested food
and reproduced their kind, thousands of years before physiologists
had attained to a true theory of digestion or reproduction.
I do not, indeed, by any means, pretend, that the public
economy of nations is governed by natural necessity, in the
same degree, as for instance, the human body. We shall find,
however, that the minute arbitrary variations usual here and
there in the course of its development, generally compensate
for one another, in accordance with the law of large numbers.
Here, too, we find harmonies, frequently of wonderful beauty,
which existed long before any one dreamt of them; innumerable
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page083">[pg 083]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg083"></a>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">natural laws</span></span>,<a href="#note_121" id="noteref_121" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">121</span></span></a> whose operation does not depend on their
recognition by individuals, and, over which, only he can obtain
power who has learned to obey them.

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page084">[pg 084]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg084"></a>
it should never be lost sight of, that the natural laws governing
the public economy of a people, like those of the human
mind, are distinguished in one very essential point from those
of the material world. They have to do with free rational beings,
who, because they are thus free and rational, are responsible
to God and their conscience, and constitute in their aggregate
a species capable of progress.

The public economy of a people has its origin simultaneously
with the people. It is neither the invention of man nor
the revelation of God. It is the natural product of the faculties
and propensities which make man man.<a href="#note_125" id="noteref_125" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">125</span></span></a> Just as it may

may it be demonstrated, that every independent household
management contains the germs of all politico-economical
activity. The public economy of a nation grows with the
nation. With the nation, it blooms and ripens. Its season
of blossoming and of maturity is the period of its greatest
strength, and, at the same time, of the most perfect development
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page085">[pg 085]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg085"></a>
of all its more important organs.<a href="#note_127" id="noteref_127" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">127</span></span></a> In respect to it, the
economic endeavors of any epoch may be said to be represented
by two great parties, the one progressive, the other,
conservative. The former would hasten the period of the nation's
richest and most varied development, the latter postpone
its departure as long as possible; and hence it comes, that a
people's economic decline is sometimes taken for progress, by
the former class, and their progress for decline, by the latter.
As a rule, the union and equilibrium of these parties are wont
to be the greatest at the period of maturity, because, then, intelligence
and the spirit of sacrifice for the common good are
most general.<a href="#note_128" id="noteref_128" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">128</span></span></a>

attention to the curative method which nature itself would
pursue, were art not to intervene. <span class="tei tei-q">“The curative power of
nature is no peculiar power; it is the result of a series of happy
adjustments, by means of which the morbid perturbation itself

the science which has to do with the laws of the development
of the economy of a nation, or with its economic national
life. (Philosophy of the history of Political Economy,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page088">[pg 088]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg088"></a>
according to von Mangoldt.) Like all the political sciences, or
sciences of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">national life</span></em>, it is concerned, on the one hand, with
the consideration of the individual man, and on the other, it
extends its investigations to the whole of human kind.<a href="#note_131" id="noteref_131" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">131</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
National life, like all life, is a whole, the various phenomena
of which are most intimately connected with one another.
Hence it is, that to understand one side of it scientifically, it is
necessary to know all its sides. But, especially, is it necessary
to fix one's attention on the following seven: language, religion,
art, science, law, the state and economy.<a href="#note_132" id="noteref_132" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">132</span></span></a> Without
language, all higher mental activity is unthinkable; without religion,
all else would lose its firmest foundation and highest
aim. Through art, alone, do all these sides attain to beauty;
through science, alone, to clearness. Law arises, the moment
conflicts of will become inevitable and an adjustment is desired.
The state has to do with them, in so far as they have any external
force or validity. Indeed, there is no human relation,
not even the highest and the sweetest, but has its economic
interests. It is, therefore, natural, that each of the sciences
which relate to these various regions of human life should, in
part, presuppose all others, and, in part, serve as a basis for
them.<a href="#note_133" id="noteref_133" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">133</span></span></a>

But in the midst of this universal relationship, it is easy to
see that law, the state and economy constitute a family, as
it were apart and more closely connected. (The social sciences,
in the narrower sense of the expression.)
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
They are confined almost exclusively to what Schleiermacher
has called <span class="tei tei-q">“effective action”</span> (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">wirksame Handeln</span></span>), while art and
science belong almost entirely to the <span class="tei tei-q">“action of representation”</span>
(<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">darstellenden Handeln</span></span>);
and religion and language combine both kinds. Law, the state, and economy too, have
their roots so deep in the physical and intellectual imperfection
of man, that we can scarcely imagine their continuance
beyond his life on earth (Gospel of Matthew, 22, 30). But
within these limits, their several provinces and the subjects
with which they are concerned are almost coincident. They
only consider these from different points of view: the science
of politics from that of sovereignty; the science of Political
Economy from that of the satisfaction of the requirement of
external goods by the people; the science of law from that of
the prevention or the peaceable adjustment of conflicts of will.
As every economic act, consciously or unconsciously, supposes
forms of law, so, by far the greater number of the laws relating
to rights, and the greater number of judgments in the
matter of rights, contain an economic element. In numberless
cases, the science of law gives us only the external <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">how</span></em>; the
deeper <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">why</span></em> is revealed to us by the science of Political
Economy.<a href="#note_134" id="noteref_134" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">134</span></span></a><a href="#note_135" id="noteref_135" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">135</span></span></a>
And, as to the state, who, for instance, can appreciate
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page090">[pg 090]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg090"></a>
the political significance of a nobility, without understanding
the economic character of rent, and of the possession of large
landed estates? Who can politically appreciate the inferior
classes of society, unless initiated into a knowledge of the laws
that govern wages and population? It were much easier to
cultivate psychology without physiology! <span class="tei tei-q">“The state is
society protected by force”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Herbart</span></span>). There are two bases

according to Thucydides); and how much the latter
has need of the former is well expressed by the familiar saying
of Montecuccoli: <span class="tei tei-q">“Money is not only the first, but the second and

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Just as clear, is the close connection between politics and
Political Economy, in the case of the science of finance, or
of the science of governmental house-keeping, otherwise the
administration of public affairs. The latter, evidently, so far
as its end is concerned, belongs to politics, but so far as the
means to that end are concerned, to National Economy. As
the physiologist cannot understand the action of the human
body, without understanding that of the head; so we would
not be able to grasp the organic whole of national economy, if
we were to leave the state, the greatest economy of all, the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page092">[pg 092]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg092"></a>
one which uninterruptedly and irresistibly acts on all others,
out of consideration.<a href="#note_141" id="noteref_141" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">141</span></span></a>

It may extend its action into all the
domains of national life mentioned above, whenever external
order is there threatened, or calls for protection; but its action is
important especially in the domains of law and economy. The
science of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">police power</span></span>, therefore, of all those doctrines
resulting from investigation into national life, takes up only
one phase of each of them; and the phases of doctrine thus

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Statistics we call the picture or representation of social life
at given periods of time, and especially at the present time,
drawn on a scale in accordance with the laws of development
discovered by means of the theoretical sciences above named;
as it were, a section through the stream. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Schlözer</span></span> calls

Statistics, as thus defined, are
as far removed from saying too much as from saying too little.
To give a complete tableau of their object, statistics should,
of course, take in the life of a people, in all its aspects. But
they should look upon such facts only as their own property,
the meaning of which they are able to understand; that is,
such only as can be ranged under known laws of development.
Unintelligible facts are collected only in the hope of
penetrating into their meaning in the future, by comparing
them with one another. In the meantime, they are to the statistician
only what unfinished experiments are to the investigator
of nature.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The view is daily gaining ground, that statistics should be
occupied—without, however, confining themselves to them—with
present facts, with <span class="tei tei-q">“facts affecting society and the state,
which are susceptible of being expressed in figures.”</span><a href="#note_144" id="noteref_144" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">144</span></span></a> The
more deceptive the immediate observation of an individual,
isolated fact is, in cases where a great number of simultaneous
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page094">[pg 094]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg094"></a>
or scattered individual isolated facts of national life should be
observed, the more important it is to discover proper numerical
relations, by noting all the like acts or experiences of men,
the time and place in question, and the relation of the aggregate
of these phenomena, to the sum-total of the population,
or to the sum-total of corresponding phenomena in other
places. When this is done, and the facts are completely enumerated
and correctly recorded, there is no danger of subjective
error. And this species of <span class="tei tei-q">“political and social measuring,”</span>
as Hildebrand calls it, may be applied, not only to
quantities, but to all qualities accessible to the observation of
the senses; since the individual or isolated qualities of the
things enumerated, may be again made objects of enumeration.
Without doubt, this mode of numerical procedure is the
most perfect for all those divisions of statistics in which it can
be followed; and hence, it should be our endeavor to make
the numerical side of statistics as comprehensive as possible.
But, one side of a science is not a science itself. As there is
no natural science proper called microscopy, embracing all
the observations made by means of the microscope, so care
should be taken not to deduce the principle of a science from
the chief instrument it employs. There will always be many
and important facts in national life which can not be subjected
to numerical calculation, although they may be established
with the usual amount of historical certainty. Were statistics
to be limited, in the manner mentioned above, they would remain
a collection of fragments, and instead of being a science,
properly so-called, become a method.<a href="#note_145" id="noteref_145" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">145</span></span></a>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Besides, it is evident, that, of statistics in general, economic
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page095">[pg 095]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg095"></a>
statistics constitute a chief part, and precisely the part most
accessible to numerical treatment. As these economic statistics
need to be always directed by the light of Political Economy,
they also furnish it with rich materials for the continuation
of its structure, and for the strengthening of such foundations
as it already has. They, are, moreover, the indispensable condition
of the application of economic theorems to practice.

The meaning of the term cameralistic science (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">Cameralwissenschaft</span></span>)
can be explained only by the history of the cameralistic
system.<a href="#note_146" id="noteref_146" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">146</span></span></a>
From the end of the middle ages, we find,
in most German countries, an institution called the Council
(<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">Kammer</span></span>) whose
province it was to administer the public
domain, and to watch over regal rights. At first, a mere
governmental commission, it was not long before it developed
into an independent board. This change had taken place in
Burgundy as early as the year 1409. It was in that country
that the emperor Maximilian became acquainted with the institution;
and by the erection of the aulic councils at Innspruck
and Vienna (1498 and 1501), he gave the principal impulse to
the imitation of it in Germany. As, at that time, the division
of labor was very little developed, and personal and collegial
authority all the more developed in consequence, it is easy to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page096">[pg 096]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg096"></a>
conceive that a great part of all the new and rapidly increasing
business of police administration was confided to these
councils. They were charged especially with what is known
to-day as economic police (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">Wirthschaftspolizei</span></span>) and an important
part of the administration of justice, in its lower departments,
was turned over to their subordinates. The most
eminent men who wrote, in the seventeenth century, on cameralistic
matters, laid great stress on the point, that it was the
duty of the aulic councils to entertain not only fiscal questions,
but that it was within their province also, to determine questions
of economic police.<a href="#note_147" id="noteref_147" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">147</span></span></a>
The interest of absolute princes
must have greatly favored these cameralistic institutions, for
they were in their hands docile tools, which escaped the annoying
intervention of the states of their realms.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
By degrees, the knowledge necessary to these council
officials, and which found no place in the lectures on law, were
formed into a special body of doctrine. After such men as
Morhof and Thomasius had prepared the way,<a href="#note_148" id="noteref_148" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">148</span></span></a> Frederick
William I., himself a clever cameralist, and author of the masterly
financial system of Prussia, took the important step of
founding, at Halle and Frankfurt on the Oder, special chairs
of economy and cameralistic science; which, considering the
time, were very ably filled by Gasser and Dithmar. (1727.)
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page097">[pg 097]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg097"></a>
There was thus formed in the German universities a distinct
school of cameralists, which, through Jung, Rössig and
Schmalz, reached to the nineteenth century. The term cameralistic
science, the creature of chance, was used, it must be
said, with very various limits to its meaning.<a href="#note_149" id="noteref_149" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">149</span></span></a>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
However, Political Economy in Germany developed out of
the science of law and the cameralistic sciences, while in England
and Italy it had its origin chiefly in the study of questions
of finance and foreign commerce.

in the last century, what it has in common with all economy,<a href="#note_150" id="noteref_150" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">150</span></span></a>
and therefore with public economy, next that which belongs to
the aggregate of governmental economy, there remains only a
number of rules, such as those which govern the principal
branches of private business, and which indicate how they are
to be carried on with the greatest advantage to those who engage
in them. Such are forest and rural economy, mining
science, technology, including architecture, and all that concerns
founderies, and commercial science. Now that the expression
cameralistic science is altogether obsolete, the aggregate
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page098">[pg 098]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg098"></a>
of these might be designated by the name private economy.
Obviously, we should have here, neither a simple nor pure science,
but only a compilation of natural-philosophical and economic
lemmas. Thus, in agriculture, for instance, a knowledge
of the different kinds of soil, of the tillage of land, of the
different plants and animals etc., belongs to the domain of natural
science; while all that relates to the cost of production, the
employment of capital, the wages of labor, the exchange of
products, net product and the price of land, are purely politico-economical.
The political economists also require a knowledge
of the natural side of the cameralistic sciences. Such a
knowledge is indispensable to every detailed and living theory,
and especially to the application of economic science to practice.
The great difference lies in this, that the cameralist interests
himself in the production of material goods for their own
sake, while the political economist regards them only in their
relations to national life.<a href="#note_151" id="noteref_151" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">151</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It would seem, moreover, that political economists, especially

in Germany, have attached too much importance to putting
formal bounds to their special science. Why not rather follow
the example of the students of nature who care little

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Political Economy treats chiefly of the material interests of
nations. It inquires how the various wants of the people of a
country, especially those of food, clothing, fuel, shelter, of the
sexual instinct etc., may be satisfied; how the satisfaction of
these wants influences the aggregate national life, and how
in turn, they are influenced by the national life. (Gospel of
Matth., 4, 4.) This alone suffices to enable us to estimate the
importance of the science. The relation of virtue to wealth
is likened by Bacon to that of an army to its baggage. In
Xenophon's opinion, wealth is really useful only to him who
knows how to make a good use of it. From an economic point
of view, the happiest man is he who has accumulated most,
honorably, and used it best.<a href="#note_153" id="noteref_153" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">153</span></span></a> That, even in a material sense,
the intellect of a people is their most important element, is evident
from the example of the Chinese, who were so long acquainted
with printing, powder, and the mariner's compass,
without, by their means, attaining to intelligent public opinion,
forming a good army, or coming to an understanding of the
art of navigation, to any great extent.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The undervaluing of economic matters, for which ages of
inferior cultivation, our own middle ages for instance, are now
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page100">[pg 100]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg100"></a>
praised and now blamed, was really a rare exception even
during these ages.<a href="#note_154" id="noteref_154" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">154</span></span></a>
Other kinds of acquisition and enjoyment
then occupied the foreground; but there never was a time,
when gain and enjoyment in general were not favorite objects
of pursuit, and held in high esteem. The physical wants of
uncultured men cry out much louder than intellectual ones.

The mere servants of mammon, whether
as political economists or as private individuals, may see their
depravity faithfully reflected in communism as in a mirror.
We should not overlook the fact that it is with whole nations
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page101">[pg 101]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg101"></a>
as with the individual man who amasses his own fortune. He
reaches the culminating point of his wealth generally after he

which would apply to any science of national
life, principles borrowed from any other science, are now generally
looked upon as obsolete. This is true, especially, of
the theological method which prevailed, almost exclusively
during the middle ages,<a href="#note_160" id="noteref_160" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">160</span></span></a> and of the juridical method of the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It would be much more in harmony with the intellectual
tendencies of the time, to adopt a mathematical mode of treatment
in Political Economy, involving, as such a mode of treatment
does, not the matter of the science, but only a formal
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page103">[pg 103]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg103"></a>
principle. That which is general in Political Economy has,
it must be acknowledged, much that is analogous to the mathematical
sciences. Like the latter, it swarms with abstractions.<a href="#note_161" id="noteref_161" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">161</span></span></a>
Just as there are, strictly speaking, no mathematical
lines or points in nature, and no mathematical lever, there is
nowhere such a thing as production or rent, entirely pure and
simple. The mathematical laws of motion operate in a hypothetical
vacuum, and, where applied, are subjected to important
modifications, in consequence of atmospheric resistance. Something
similar is true of most of the laws of our science; as, for
instance, those in accordance with which the price of commodities
is fixed by the buyer and seller. It also, always supposes
the parties to the contract to be guided only by a sense
of their own best interest, and not to be influenced by secondary
considerations. It is not, therefore, to be wondered at, that
many authors have endeavored to clothe the laws of Political
Economy in algebraic formulæ.<a href="#note_162" id="noteref_162" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">162</span></span></a> And, indeed, wherever magnitudes
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page104">[pg 104]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg104"></a>
and the relations of magnitudes to one another are
treated of, it must be possible to subject them to calculation.
Herbart has shown that this is so in the case of psychology;<a href="#note_163" id="noteref_163" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">163</span></span></a>
and all the sciences which treat of national life, especially our
own, are psychological.<a href="#note_164" id="noteref_164" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">164</span></span></a> But the advantages of the mathematical
mode of expression diminish as the facts to which it is applied
become more complicated. This is true even in the ordinary
psychology of the individual. How much more, therefore,
in the portraying of national life! Here the algebraic
formulæ would soon become so complicated, as to make all
further progress in the operation next to impossible.<a href="#note_165" id="noteref_165" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">165</span></span></a> Their
employment, especially in a science whose sphere it is, at present,
to increase the number of the facts observed, to make
them the object of exhaustive investigation, and vary the combinations
into which they may be made to enter, is a matter of
great difficulty, if not entirely impossible.<a href="#note_166" id="noteref_166" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">166</span></span></a> For, most assuredly,
as our science has to do with men, it must take them and
treat them as they actually are, moved at once by very different
and non-economic motives, belonging to an entirely definite
people, state, age etc. The abstraction according to which
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page105">[pg 105]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg105"></a>
all men are by nature the same, different only in consequence
of a difference of education, position in life etc., all equally
well equipped, skillful and free in the matter of economic production
and consumption, is one which, as Ricardo and von
Thünen have shown, must pass as an indispensable stage in
the preparatory labors of political economists. It would be
especially well, when an economic fact is produced by the cooperation
of many different factors, for the investigator to mentally
isolate the factor of which, for the time being, he wishes
to examine the peculiar nature. All other factors should, for
a time, be considered as not operating, and as unchangeable,
and then the question asked, What would be the effect of a
change in the factor to be examined, whether the change be
occasioned by enlarging or diminishing it? But it never should
be lost sight of, that such a one is only an abstraction after all,
for which, not only in the transition to practice, but even in finished
theory, we must turn to the infinite variety of real life.<a href="#note_167" id="noteref_167" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">167</span></span></a>

There are two important inquiries in all sciences whose subject
matter is national or social life: 1. What <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></em>? (What has
been? How did it become so? etc.) 2. What <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">should be</span></em>? The
greater number of political economists have confounded these
questions one with the other, but not all to the same extent.<a href="#note_168" id="noteref_168" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">168</span></span></a>

Any one who has read a goodly number of idealistic works
treating of public economy (the state, law etc.) cannot have
failed to be struck by the enormous differences, and even contradictions,
as to what theorizers have considered desirable and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page107">[pg 107]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg107"></a>
necessary. There is scarcely an important point which the
highest authorities may not be cited for or against. We must
not close our eyes to this fact. <span class="tei tei-q">“The giddiness that comes
from contemplating the depths of knowledge is the beginning
of philosophy, as the god Thaumas was, according to the fable,
the father of Iris.”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Plato.</span></span>) In a precisely similar manner,
the student of public economy (politics, the philosophy of
law etc.) must familiarize himself with the variations that have
taken place in what men, at different periods of history, have
required of the state and public economy, until he is lost in
wonder at the contemplation.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is impossible to fail to notice at once that those ideal descriptions
which have enjoyed great fame and exerted great
influence, depart very little from the real conditions of the public
economy (of the state, law etc.) surrounding their authors.<a href="#note_170" id="noteref_170" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">170</span></span></a>
This is not mere chance. The power of great theorizers, as,
indeed, of all great men, lies, as a rule, in this, that they satisfy
the want of their own time to an unusual extent; and it is the
peculiar task of theorizers to give expression to this want
with scientific clearness, and to justify it with scientific depth.
But the real wants of a people will, in the long run, be satisfied
in life,<a href="#note_171" id="noteref_171" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">171</span></span></a>
so far as this is possible to the moral imperfection
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page108">[pg 108]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg108"></a>
of man. We should at least be on our guard when we
hear it said that whole nations have been forced into an <span class="tei tei-q">“unnatural”</span>
course by priests, tyrants and cavilers. For, to leave
human freedom and divine Providence out of consideration
entirely, how is such a thing possible? The supposed tyrants
are generally part and parcel of the people themselves; all
their resources are derived from the people. They must have
been new Archimedeses standing outside of their own world.
(Compare, however, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">infra</span></span>, § 263.)
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is true, that if the result of the growth of generations be
to gradually produce a different people, these different men
may require different institutions. Then a struggle arises between
the old and those of the younger generation; the former
wish to retain what has been tested by time, the latter to seek
for the satisfaction of their new wants by new means. As the
sea always oscillates between the flowing and ebbing of the
tides, so the life of nations, between periods of repose and of
crisis: periods of repose, when existing forms answer to the
real substance of things, and of crisis, when the changed substance
or contents seeks to build up a new form for itself.
Such crises are called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">reforms</span></span> when they are effected in a
peaceful way, and in accordance with positive law. When
accomplished in violation of law, they are called revolutions.<a href="#note_172" id="noteref_172" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">172</span></span></a>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That every revolution, it matters not how great the need of
the change produced by it, is as such an enormous evil, a serious,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page109">[pg 109]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg109"></a>
and sometimes, fatal disease of the body politic, is self-evident.
The injury to morals which the spectacle of victorious
wrong almost always produces can be healed, as a rule, only
in the following generation. Where law has been once trampled
on, the <span class="tei tei-q">“right of the stronger”</span> will prevail; and the
stronger is, to some extent, the most unscrupulous and reckless
in the choice of the means to be employed. Hence, the
well-known fact, that in revolutionary times the worst so frequently
remain the victors. The counter-revolution which is
wont to follow on the heels of revolution, and with a corresponding
violence, is a compensation only to the most shortsighted.
It allows the disease, the familiarizing of the people
with the infringement of law, to continue, until the hitherto
sound parts are attacked. Hence, a people should, if they
would have it go well with them, in the changes in the form
of things which they make, take as their model Time, whose
reforms are the surest and most irresistible, but, at the same
time, as Bacon says, so gradual that they cannot be seen or
observed at any one moment. It is true, that, as all that is
great is difficult, so also is the carrying out of uninterrupted
reform. Its carrying out, indeed, supposes two things: a constitution
so wisely planned as to keep the doors open both to
the disappearing institutions of the past and to the coming
institutions of the future; and, among all classes of the people,
a moral control of themselves, so absolute that, no matter what
the inconvenience, or how great the sacrifice, legal ways shall
alone be used. In this manner, two of the greatest and apparently
most contradictory wants of every legal or moral
person, the want of uninterrupted continuity and that of free
development, may be satisfied.

It is doubtless true that all economic laws, and all economic
institutions are made for the people, not the people for such laws
and institutions. Their mutability is, therefore, by no means
such an evil as mankind should endeavor to remove, but is
wholesome and laudable, so far as it runs parallel with the
transformation of the people, and the changes which their
wants have undergone.<a href="#note_173" id="noteref_173" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">173</span></span></a>
Hence, there is no reason why the
most various ideal systems should contradict one another. Any
one of them may be right, but, of course, only for one people
and one age. In this case, the only error would be, if they
should claim to be universally applicable. There can no more
be an economic ideal adapted to the various wants of every
people, than a garment which should fit every individual.
The leading-strings of children and the staff of age would
be great annoyances to the man. <span class="tei tei-q">“Reason becomes nonsense
and beneficence a torment.”</span> Hence, whoever would
elaborate the ideal of the best public economy—and the greater
number of political economists have really wished to do this—should,
if he would be perfectly true, and at the same time practical,
place in juxta position as many different ideals as there
are different types of people.<a href="#note_174" id="noteref_174" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">174</span></span></a>
He would, moreover, have
to revise his work every few years; for, in proportion as
a people change, and new wants originate, the economic
ideal suitable to them must change also. But it is impossible
to accomplish this on so large a scale. Besides, to appreciate
the present thus instantaneously, and to perfectly feel the pulse
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page111">[pg 111]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg111"></a>
of time thus uninterruptedly, requires a species of talent different
from what even the most distinguished scientists are
wont to possess; talents of an entirely practical nature, such as
become a great minister of the interior or of finance. And it is
an acknowledged fact, that even the cleverest of such practicioners,
as the younger Pitt said of himself, generally feel
their way instinctively, and do not see it with the clearness
necessary to indicate it to others.

We refuse entirely to lend ourselves in theory to the construction
of such ideal systems. Our aim is simply to describe
man's economic nature and economic wants, to investigate the
laws and the character of the institutions which are adapted to
the satisfaction of these wants, and the greater or less amount
of success by which they have been attended.<a href="#note_175" id="noteref_175" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">175</span></span></a> Our task is,

These are matters to be found within the domain of reality,
susceptible of demonstration or refutation by the ordinary operations
of science; entirely true or entirely false, and, therefore,
in the former case, not liable to become obsolete. We
proceed after the manner of the investigator of nature. We,
too, have our dissecting knife and microscope, and we have
an advantage over the student of nature in this, that the self-observation
of the body is exceedingly limited, while that of
mind is almost unlimited. There are other respects, however,
in which he has the advantage over us. When he wishes to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page112">[pg 112]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg112"></a>
study a given species, he may make a hundred or a thousand
experiments, and use a hundred or a thousand individuals for
his purpose. Hence, he can easily control each separate observation,
and distinguish the exception from the rule. But,
how many nations are there which we can make use of for
purposes of comparison? Their very fewness makes it all the
more imperative to compare them all. Doubtless, comparison
cannot supply the place of observation; but observation may
be thus rendered more thorough, many-sided, and richer in
the number of its points of view. Interested alike in the differences
and resemblances, we must first form our rules from
the latter, consider the former as the exceptions, and then endeavor
to explain them. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Infra</span></span>, § 266).

We meet with few who are only guided by ideal motives, but
with few, also, who hearken only to the voice of egotism, and
care for nothing but themselves. It may, therefore, be assumed,
that any view current on certain tangible interests
which concern man very nearly, and which has been shared
by great parties and even by whole peoples for generations, is
not based only on ignorance or a perverse love of wrong. The
error consists more frequently in applying measures wholesome
and even absolutely necessary under certain circumstances, to
circumstances entirely different. And here, a thorough insight
into the conditions of the measure suffices to compose the
differences between the two parties. Once the natural laws
of Political Economy are sufficiently known and recognized,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page113">[pg 113]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg113"></a>
all that is needed, in any given instance, is more exact and
reliable statistics of the fact involved, to reconcile all party
controversies on questions of the politics of public economy,
so far, at least, as these controversies arise from a difference
of opinion. It may be that science may never attain to this,
in consequence of the new problems which are ever arising
and demanding a solution. It may be, too, that in the greater
number of party controversies, the opposed purposes of the
parties play a more important part even than the opposed
views. Be this as it may, it is necessary, especially in an age
as deeply agitated as our own, when every good citizen is in
duty bound to ally himself to party, that every honest party-man
should seek to secure, amid the ocean of ephemeral opinions,
a firm island of scientific truth, as universally recognized
as truth as are the principles of mathematical physics by
physicians of the most various schools.

Another characteristic feature of the historical method is
that it does away with the feeling of self-sufficiency, and the
braggadocio which cause most men to ridicule what they do
not understand, and the higher to look down with contempt on
lower civilizations. Whoever is acquainted with the laws of
the development of the plant, cannot fail to see in the seed the
germ of its growth, and in its flower, the herald of decay. If
there were inhabitants of the moon, and one of them should
visit our earth, and find children and grown people side by
side, while ignorant of the laws of human development, would
he not look upon the most beautiful child as a mere monster,
with an enormous head, with arms and legs of stunted growth,
useless genitals, and destitute of reason? The folly of such a
judgment would be obvious to every one; and yet we meet
with thousands like it on the state and the public economy of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page114">[pg 114]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg114"></a>
nations when in lower stages of civilization, and this, even

We may, indeed, make a critical comparison of different
forms, each of which answers perfectly to its object or contents;
but such a comparison can possess historical objectivity,
only when it is based on a correct view of the peculiar
course of development followed by the people in question.

difficulty, accurately to determine the culminating point of
a people's civilization. The old man believes, as a rule, that
the times are growing worse, because he is no longer in a
way to utilize them; the young man, as a rule, that they are
growing better, because he hopes to turn them to account.
It is, however, always a purely empirical question; and in the
solution of it, the observer's eye may acquire a singular acuteness
by the comparative study of as many nations as possible,
especially of those which have already passed away.<a href="#note_179" id="noteref_179" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">179</span></span></a>

Could anyone contemplate the history of mankind as a

Before I close, I must refer to a possible objection which
may be made to historical or physiological Political Economy:
that it may indeed be taught, but that it cannot be a practical
science. If it be assumed that those principles only are practical,
which may be applied immediately by every reader, in
practice, this work must disclaim all pretensions to that title.
I doubt very much if, in this sense, there is a single science
susceptible of a practical exposition.<a href="#note_181" id="noteref_181" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">181</span></span></a> Genuine practitioners,
who know life with its thousands of relations by experience,
will be the first to grant that such a collection of prescriptions,

Our endeavor has been, not to write a practical book, but
to train our readers to be practical. To this end, we have
sought to describe the laws of nature which man cannot control,
but, at most, only utilize. We call the attention of the
reader to the different points of view, from which every economic
fact must be observed, to do justice to every claim. We
would like to accustom the reader, when he is examining the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page116">[pg 116]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg116"></a>
most insignificant politico-economical fact, never to lose sight
of the whole, not only of public economy but of national life.
We are very strongly of the opinion, that only he can form a
correct judgment and defend his views against all objections,
on such questions as to where, how and when certain liens
and charges, monopolies, privileges, services etc., should be
abolished, who fully understands why they were once imposed
or introduced. Especially, do we not desire to impress a certain
number of rules of action on those who have confided
themselves to our guidance, after having first demonstrated
their excellence. Our highest ambition is to put our readers
in a way to discover such rules of direction for themselves,
after they have conscientiously weighed all the facts, untrammeled
by any earthly authority whatever.<a href="#note_182" id="noteref_182" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">182</span></span></a><a href="#note_183" id="noteref_183" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">183</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To create new matter is more than it is given to man to do.
Hence, by the term production, in its widest sense, we mean
simply the bringing forth of new goods—the discovery of new
utilities, the change or transformation of already existing
goods into new utilities,<a href="#note_184" id="noteref_184" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">184</span></span></a> the creation of means for the satisfaction
of human wants, out of the aggregate of matter originally
present in the world. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Producere!</span></span>) We confine ourselves,
however, in this to economic goods, as defined in § <a class="tei tei-ref pginternal" href="#Section_2">2</a>.
In a secondary and more limited sense, production is an increase
of resources, in so far as the goods produced satisfy a greater
human want, than those employed in the production itself.<a href="#note_185" id="noteref_185" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">185</span></span></a><a href="#note_186" id="noteref_186" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">186</span></span></a><a href="#note_187" id="noteref_187" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">187</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It would, however, be an error to suppose, that the creation
of certain utilities for the producer himself, or for others,
constitutes the only end of economic production. The
more perfect economic production becomes, the greater grows
the pleasure the producer feels in his products, which pleasure
is at once the effect and the cause of his success. Hence,
production is to a great extent its own end. That this is
so in the case of artists is well known. <span class="tei tei-q">“If you want only
progeny from her, a mortal can beget them as well. Let
him who rejoices in the goddess, not seek in her the woman,”</span>
says Schiller. There is not a really clever workman but has
something artistic in his mode of production. And even the
meanest productive activity, provided it is neither over-driven
nor misdirected, must of itself exert a good influence on the
physical and moral development or preservation of the producer.
An idle brain is the devil's workshop.<a href="#note_188" id="noteref_188" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">188</span></span></a>

The division of natural forces which formerly obtained, into
organic, chemical and mechanical, is of no great importance
in Political Economy. The tendency is more and more to resolve
organic forces partly into chemical and partly into mechanical.
Between mechanical and chemical forces, again, the
boundary is not fixed, heat being always capable of producing
motion, and motion always of producing heat. Hence, it is
all the more important for us to find a division of the economic
gifts (matter, forces<a href="#note_190" id="noteref_190" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">190</span></span></a> and relations) of external nature, into such

A. Those gifts of nature which, because they cannot be

a direct value in exchange, belong either to the class of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">free</span></span>
goods, in the fullest sense of the word, as, for instance, sunlight

Special mention should be here made of climate, and of its
heat or moisture. The lines called isothermal, that is, lines of
equal annual heat, are, therefore, of greatest importance to
public economy, because the <span class="tei tei-q">“zones of production”</span> depend
mainly on them.<a href="#note_194" id="noteref_194" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">194</span></span></a> However, we are concerned here, not only
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page123">[pg 123]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg123"></a>
with the average temperature of the whole year, but especially
with the distribution of heat among the several parts of
the day and the different seasons of the year, and the maximum
summer heat and winter cold (the isothermal and iso-cheimenal
lines). Coast lands are wont to have a milder winter
and a cooler summer than continental ones with an equal average
yearly heat. This produces a great difference in vegetation,
because there are a great many plants which can endure
the winter's cold very well, but require a hot summer; and
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vice versa</span></span>.<a href="#note_195" id="noteref_195" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">195</span></span></a> Were it not for this
fact, in connection with the winter-sleep of plants, a
large portion of the north would be entirely uninhabitable.
Besides, the temperature of a place does not depend
exclusively on its latitude, or on its height
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page124">[pg 124]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg124"></a>
above the sea-level.<a href="#note_196" id="noteref_196" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">196</span></span></a> The humidity of the climate is,
as a rule, great in proportion to the quantity of water in its neighborhood,
and to the height of its temperature; although, for instance,
in Europe, the number of rainy days increases, the
further we advance towards the north.<a href="#note_197" id="noteref_197" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">197</span></span></a> Although the distance
of a place from the equator and its height above the
level of the sea have, in many respects, a similar effect (vertical,
horizontal isothermal lines and zones of production), mountainous
regions are uniformly distinguished by a greater
degree of humidity, which makes them better adapted for
pasturage and forest-culture. But the flora of a locality, being
the resultant of all its conditions, affords us a much better
criterion of the value of the climate for economic purposes,
than the most accurate thermometric observations. Other
things being equal, the productive force of nature operates,
doubtless, with most energy, in warm climates. The more
remote a country is from the equator, the more is its fertility
confined to its lowest parts.<a href="#note_198" id="noteref_198" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">198</span></span></a>
Greater heat will, as a rule, ripen the same product sooner,
and thus permit the same land to be used several times in
the same year.<a href="#note_199" id="noteref_199" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">199</span></span></a> Each individual

many respects. The fruit, for instance, and wine, contain
more sugar,<a href="#note_201" id="noteref_201" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">201</span></span></a>
and oleaginous plants contain more oil. Lastly,
since nature in warm countries is so much more generous, it
may be utilized by man with less regard for consequences.
There is less need of extensive woods, of large winter supplies,
especially for animals;<a href="#note_202" id="noteref_202" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">202</span></span></a> fewer
buildings are demanded, and there is also less demand for human and brute labor, since
the work of plowing, sowing etc., extends over a greater portion

B. Those gifts of external nature which may become objects
of private property, and at the same time possess sufficient
relative scarcity to give them value in exchange, are
either movable, and exhaustible in a given place, or firmly
connected with the land. The first category embraces, for
instance, such wild animals and plants as serve some useful
purpose, minerals, above all, fossil combustible matter<a href="#note_205" id="noteref_205" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">205</span></span></a>—the

<span class="tei tei-q">“black diamonds,”</span> coal, of which, with its canals, Franklin
said that it had made England what it is. The economical
effect of their moveable character is best seen, when the use
made of an ordinary stratum of coal is compared with that of
a protracted subterranean fire in a coal mine.<a href="#note_206" id="noteref_206" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">206</span></span></a> The latter can
be directly useful only to those in its immediate vicinity.
Every lower layer of the burning coal would be less useful.
An increase of its actual power by accumulation in time or
place is scarcely possible. In all these respects, the movable
coal is incomparably better adapted to the satisfaction of man's
wants. It may be said that the capacity of heat for drying,
distilling, melting and hardening purposes, of imparting rapid
motion to heavy objects by the production of confined steam,
is, at least, a thousand times as great when a thousand bushels
of coal are consumed as when one is consumed. In most cases
even the concentration of a large quantity of coal will increase,
the result not only absolutely, but relatively.<a href="#note_207" id="noteref_207" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">207</span></span></a><a href="#note_208" id="noteref_208" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">208</span></span></a>

The materials, forces and relations or conditions of external
nature, immovably connected with parts of the land, even
when in themselves exhaustless, either allow only of a definite
amount of economic utilization, as, for instance, the mechanical
force of a given waterfall, which can drive only a definite number
of mills of a definite size;<a href="#note_209" id="noteref_209" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">209</span></span></a> or their increased utilization is
accompanied by difficulties which increase with still greater
rapidity. This last is the case, especially in the employment
of land for agricultural purposes. It is, according to Senior,
one of the four fundamental axioms of Political Economy, that
additional labor, spent on a given quantity of land, produces,
as a rule, a relatively smaller yield; assuming, of course, that
the art of agriculture remains the same. It is not possible to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page129">[pg 129]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg129"></a>
determine either generally, or in particular cases, the precise
point at which agriculture should stop, to prevent relatively
smaller returns from increased expenditure of labor and capital.
Improvements in the art of agriculture may remove it a
great distance. But, that there is such a point admits of no
doubt. No one will believe that an acre of land can be made
to produce a quantity of the means of subsistence sufficient to
support all Europe, no matter what the amount of seed used,
or of manure etc. employed.<a href="#note_210" id="noteref_210" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">210</span></span></a>

the earth's supply of food for plants must be considered as analogous,
so far as its exhaustibility and capacity to be appropriated
are concerned, to the beds of coal and of ore etc. which
occur in mining districts. This is certainly true, with a few
important differences, however, as for instance, that, as a rule,

Incomparably more important in the economic valuation of
a piece of land is its capacity for cultivation, because this depends
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page131">[pg 131]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg131"></a>
much less on the good or bad quality of the husbandman's
art. I mean here the so-called physical constitution of
the vegetable soil; its water-holding power, its consistency
(light or heavy soil) on which the difficulty of working it depends;
its ability to dry, in a shorter or longer time, and its
accompanying diminution in volume; its ability to draw moisture
from the atmosphere and to absorb the various kinds of
gases; its heat-absorbing and heat-containing power (hot,
warm and cold soils).<a href="#note_215" id="noteref_215" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">215</span></span></a> Much depends here on the depth of
the vegetable soil and on the constitution of the sub-soil,
which, for instance, when it is very permeable, improves a
very moist soil, but in the form of meadow iron-ore (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Wiesenerz</span></span>),
works great injury. The vertical form of the land is
also a very important element in estimating the natural fertility
of the soil. In mountainous districts, the quantity of land
which can be used (and with what labor!) is wont to be relatively
smaller than in low lands. Hence it is, that the former
become too small for their inhabitants; who, therefore,
swarm over the plains lying before them either as settlers or
conquerors.<a href="#note_216" id="noteref_216" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">216</span></span></a> In the eastern hemisphere, the northern slopes
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page132">[pg 132]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg132"></a>

the southern slopes are frequently subjected to more trying

But all these more special qualities of the soil must be distinguished
from their general basis, the bearing or carrying capacity
which land possesses as a mere superficies, and which
the most naked rock (Malta!), and the bed of a flowing
stream (the floating gardens of China!) possess to some extent,
since there is a possibility of establishing a plant-feeding
surface on them. This bearing capacity, which in most instances
is given only by nature, and which can be added to
only to a very limited extent and at great outlay, is wont,
when the population is very dense, to acquire considerable exchange
value in the vicinity.<a href="#note_218" id="noteref_218" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">218</span></span></a><a href="#note_219" id="noteref_219" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">219</span></span></a>

anew the power of this wonderful organism, and that it has
made geography an explanatory medium between nature and
history. The conditions most favorable to the development of
civilization are found in a well developed country which slopes
gradually through a series of intermediate terraces from a
mountain summit to a plain; especially when they are connected
with one another by a good system of streams; since
here the opposite peculiarities of the populations of the highlands

in New Holland, they easily impede inter-communication;
and, still more, where the several parts of the country

Africa, the plateau of South Africa or that of Central Asia.

to which, and the security with which, he may hope to enjoy
the fruit of his labor himself. Hence it is that, as a rule, the
slave (§ <a class="tei tei-ref pginternal" href="#Section_71">71</a>, ff.) and socager work least willingly, the
day laborer with less industry than the piece-worker,<a href="#note_240" id="noteref_240" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">240</span></span></a> who is at the

labor is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page140">[pg 140]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg140"></a>
greater in proportion as the workman calculates his own advantage.
It is, therefore, smallest in the case of ingenuous uneducated

improving it. In both respects, free competition (§ <a class="tei tei-ref pginternal" href="#Section_97">97</a>)

Among the causes which have contributed to make England
the first country in the world, viewed from a politico-economical
stand-point, English writers on Political Economy
have pointed out as one of the principal, the prevalence there
of piece-wages.<a href="#note_244" id="noteref_244" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">244</span></span></a> Payment by the piece should, of course, be
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page141">[pg 141]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg141"></a>
practiced, only in cases in which the work may be broken up
into a series of isolated tasks, and is completed by such a series.
Hence, it is not applicable where a great many different
things are required of the same workman; nor in relations
in which continuity, as, for instance, of the inclination
or disposition of the workman is the chief thing.<a href="#note_245" id="noteref_245" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">245</span></span></a> The further
the division of labor is carried in our day, the greater
the part money plays in our social economy, and the more
lasting relations are dissolved, the more general becomes piece-work,
which, with all its material advantages, has, speaking
morally, its dark side. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Atomism!</span></span>)<a href="#note_246" id="noteref_246" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">246</span></span></a> In a great many branches

than the quality of work which increases with piece-work,
and where the quality of the work is what is desired,
this system has not the same field. And where it obtains, as,
for instance, in the case of ordinary type-setters, resort is had
to payment by the day for compositors engaged on mathematical
treatises, fac-similes, inscriptions etc. On the side of the

the best and most industrious workmen are carried away by
it to an extent detrimental to their health.<a href="#note_248" id="noteref_248" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">248</span></span></a> However, many

on his own account, or has a share in the profits. This last is
proper only in those branches of the business the success of
which depends on the quality of the work. To compel the
workman to share in the profits alone will not do, because he
is generally too poor to run any risk or to do long without his
earnings. The system of paying <span class="tei tei-q">“commissions,”</span> therefore, is
to be recommended all the more strongly, since it is a combination
of fixed wages with a share in the profits. This system
is very prevalent in North America, where a great deal
has to be confided to the workmen. It is practiced, also, in
the whale fisheries, and on the Greek ships in the Levant engaged
in coasting, where much more depends on the care of
the sailors than on the ability of the captain.<a href="#note_251" id="noteref_251" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">251</span></span></a> It presupposes

for instance, in the case of overseers of labor; since every better
inducement to the taste for labor which is not only juster
but more complicative, is not only a condition but also the effect
of higher culture. But if the economy of a people is ripe
for share-wages, and masters begin to introduce them in earnest
in individual cases, the work produced will be improved to
such a degree that it can not be long before all others will be
necessitated to follow them.<a href="#note_253" id="noteref_253" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">253</span></span></a>

The average labor-power of individuals varies very much
in different nations.<a href="#note_255" id="noteref_255" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">255</span></span></a>
The reason of this is, in part, doubtless
a difference in natural endowments. Thus, for instance, no
people surpass the English and Anglo-American in energy,
none the German in intelligence in work or the French in taste.
Where we can assume that the same meaning is attached to the
expression, <span class="tei tei-q">“military capacity,”</span> by the different recruiting bureaus,
important conclusions as to the physical labor-power of
different localities may be drawn from the ratio existing between
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page146">[pg 146]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg146"></a>
the number of those fit for military service and those
who are legally liable to military duty.<a href="#note_256" id="noteref_256" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">256</span></span></a>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But these conclusions are greatly modified by the state of
civilization and that of society. Where the laboring classes
are despised and paid in a manner unworthy of human beings,
the badness of their work will be in keeping with the estimation
in which it is held. The reverse of this, also, is usually
true under different circumstances. (§ 173.) Thus, it has been
noticed in France, that native workmen, provided with as substantial
food as English workmen, are scarcely inferior to the
the latter in the technic value of their labor.<a href="#note_257" id="noteref_257" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">257</span></span></a> A Mecklenburg
day laborer eats almost twice as much as a Thuringian
workman, but then he accomplishes almost twice as much.
Hence, employers gain in the long run by paying their workmen
well. As civilization advances, the same number of workmen
become, not only more industrious and more capable, but the
same quantity and quality of labor becomes, as a rule, cheaper.<a href="#note_258" id="noteref_258" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">258</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The moral culture of a people exerts the greatest influence
here. In every private undertaking, a great part of the expense
attending it, and in every state, a great part of the expense
of its police system, and of its system of administering
justice, is occasioned only by the dishonesty of men. If all
this expense could be dispensed with, and full confidence placed
in individuals, it would be possible to devote much more time
and energy to positively useful labor.<a href="#note_259" id="noteref_259" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">259</span></span></a> In estimating the labor-power
of different nations or different periods of time, the division
of population according to age is also of importance.
As a rule, the labor-power of males is greatest from the age
of twenty-five to the age of forty-five. The more numerous,
therefore, the class of the population between these ages is,
the more favorably, other things being equal, is it situated as
regards labor.<a href="#note_260" id="noteref_260" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">260</span></span></a><a href="#note_261" id="noteref_261" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">261</span></span></a>
But, as a rule, the relative number of full-grown
people is greatest in highly civilized nations. (§ 248.)<a href="#note_262" id="noteref_262" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">262</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As civilization advances, labor becomes more honorable.
All barbarous nations despise it as slavish. <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Pigrum et iners videtur sudore
adquirere quod possis sanguine parare</span></span>: has been
the motto of all medieval times. In heathen Iceland, the
owner of a piece of land might be deprived of it by an adversary
who could overpower him in single combat. This mode
of acquisition was considered more honorable than purchase.
It was Thor's own form of investiture. The ideas of the
Romans on rightful acquisition may be inferred from the word
<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">mancipium</span></span>
(manu capere).<a href="#note_263" id="noteref_263" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">263</span></span></a> Pure Christianity,
on the other hand, preached the honorableness of labor from the first
(Thess. 4, 11; II. Thess. 3, 8 seq.; Eph. 4, 28). And so in
the time of the Reformation,<a href="#note_264" id="noteref_264" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">264</span></span></a>
when Christendom was returning
to its primitive purity.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In keeping with this is the fact, that the most cultivated
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page149">[pg 149]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg149"></a>
nations, and the same may be said of individuals, value time
most highly. <span class="tei tei-q">“Time is money.”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Benjamin Franklin.</span></span>) An
English proverb calls time the stuff of which life is made.<a href="#note_265" id="noteref_265" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">265</span></span></a>
While in negro nations, individuals do not even know their
own age; while in Russia, there are very few clocks to
strike the hours, even in the towers of churches, in England,
a watch is considered an indispensable article of apparel, even
for very young people and for some of the lower orders of
society.<a href="#note_266" id="noteref_266" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">266</span></span></a>
Railroads operate in this respect as a kind of national
clock. The introduction of machinery and the more
minute division of labor, make punctuality a necessity. While
South Americans and West Indians are frightfully careless in
their every movement, a carelessness which betrays itself even
in their drawling speech,<a href="#note_267" id="noteref_267" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">267</span></span></a> the life of a New Englander has
been compared to the rush of a locomotive. In the markets
of Central Asia, nothing strikes the European with so much
surprise as the little value put upon time by the merchants of
India and Bucharia, who are fully satisfied when, after endless
waiting, they succeed in obtaining a somewhat higher price
for their wares.<a href="#note_268" id="noteref_268" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">268</span></span></a>

classes of goods:

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Soil-improvements</span></span>, for instance, drainage and irrigation
works, dikes, hedges etc., which are, indeed, sometimes so far
part of the land itself that it is difficult to distinguish them
from it.<a href="#note_271" id="noteref_271" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">271</span></span></a>
To this class belong all permanent plantations.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
B. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Buildings</span></span>, which embrace workshops and storehouses
as well as dwellings; also artificial roads of all kinds.

latter especially for personal service, and for the preservation
and transportation of other goods. A machine is distinguished
from a tool in that the moving power of the former is not communicated
to it immediately by the human body, which only
directs it; while the latter serves as a species of equipment, or
as a better substitute for some member of man's body.<a href="#note_273" id="noteref_273" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">273</span></span></a> To
be of advantage, these three kinds of capital must save more
labor or fatigue than it has cost to produce them. Tools are,
however, older than machines. The aborigines of Australia
used only a lance and a club in hunting; the somewhat more
civilized American Indians, the bow and arrow; Europeans
use firearms: in all of which a gradual progress is observable.
Of the blind forces which communicate motion to machines,
water was the first used, then the wind, and last of all,
steam.<a href="#note_274" id="noteref_274" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">274</span></span></a>

the principal material which constitutes the essential substance

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page154">[pg 154]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg154"></a>
but which, for the most part, is not exhausted by use.
There are species of this kind of capital which may be transferred,
as for instance, the good will of a well-established firm.
Others are as inseparably connected with human capacity for
labor as soil-improvements with a piece of land; e.g., the
greater dexterity acquired by a workman through scientific
study, or the greater confidence he has acquired by long trial.<a href="#note_276" id="noteref_276" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">276</span></span></a>
The state itself is the most important incorporeal capital of
every nation, since it is clearly indispensable, at least indirectly,
to economic production.<a href="#note_277" id="noteref_277" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">277</span></span></a>

The greater portion of the national capital is in a state of
constant transformation. It is being continually destroyed and
reproduced. But from the stand-point of private economy,
as well as from that of the whole people, we say that capital
is preserved, increased or diminished according as its value is
preserved, increased or diminished.<a href="#note_278" id="noteref_278" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">278</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Capital, according to the employment that can be given it,
may be divided into such as affects the production of material
goods, and such as affects personal goods or useful relations.
The former, under the name of productive capital, is, in recent
politico-economical literature, usually opposed to capital in
use.<a href="#note_279" id="noteref_279" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">279</span></span></a>
Evidently any one of the two kinds of capital mentioned
above, may be used for both purposes.<a href="#note_280" id="noteref_280" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">280</span></span></a> Indeed, the two
classes are, in many respects, coincident. Thus, a livery-stable
carriage or a circulating library is productive capital to its
proprietor, and capital in use<a href="#note_281" id="noteref_281" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">281</span></span></a>
(<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">Gebrauchskapital</span></span>) to the nation
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page156">[pg 156]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg156"></a>
in general; although the circulating library from which an
Arkwright obtains technic information, or the livery-stable
vehicle which carries a Borsig to his counting-room, has certainly
been used in the production of material goods. Almost
all capital in use may be converted into productive capital,
and hence, the former might be called quiescent capital, and
the latter working capital.<a href="#note_282" id="noteref_282" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">282</span></span></a> One of the principal differences
between productive capital and capital in use is, that the former,
even when most judiciously employed, does not so immediately
replace itself, as the latter, by its returns.<a href="#note_283" id="noteref_283" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">283</span></span></a> On the other
hand, the real dividing line between capital in use, and objects
consumed which are not capital, is, and it is in complete harmony
with our definition of capital, that the latter are subject
not only to a more speedy destruction and one which is always
contemplated, while in the case of the former, its destruction
is only the unintended reverse-side of its use.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Among a highly civilized people, a great amount of capital
in use, as compared with the productive capital of the country,
may be considered a sure sign of great wealth. When this
is the case, the people, without losing the desire of further acquisition,
think that they have enough to richly enjoy the
present. I need only call to mind the munificence displayed
by the middle classes in England, in their silver plate and
other domestic utensils. But the people of Russia, and Mexico
also, can make no mean display of silverware.<a href="#note_284" id="noteref_284" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">284</span></span></a> Here luxury
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page157">[pg 157]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg157"></a>
is only a symptom of the disinclination or inability of the
inhabitants of the country to use their capital in the production
of wealth. How much richer would Spain be to-day, if it had
employed the idle capital spent in the ornamentation of its
churches in constructing roads and canals!<a href="#note_285" id="noteref_285" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">285</span></span></a> Most nations in
a low state of civilization suffer from the absence of legal guarantees.
Each one is compelled to turn his property into a
shape in which it can be most easily transferred from one
place to another and hidden. This is the principal reason why
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page158">[pg 158]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg158"></a>
the Orientals possess, relatively speaking, so many precious
stones and so much of the precious metals. The same cause
accounts for the simplicity of their dwellings.<a href="#note_286" id="noteref_286" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">286</span></span></a> On the other
hand, productive capital is to be found in the greatest proportion
among civilized nations which are making very rapid strides
towards wealth, the people of the United States, for instance.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Capital, according as it is employed, is divided into fixed
capital and circulating capital. Fixed capital may be used
many times in production by its owner; circulating capital
only once. The value of the latter kind of capital passes
wholly into the value of the new product. In the case of the
former kind of capital, only the value of its use passes into the
new product. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hermann.</span></span>) Hence, the farmer's beasts of
burthen belong to his fixed capital; their food, and his cattle
intended for the slaughter, to his circulating capital. In a
manufactory of machines, a boiler intended for sale is circulating
capital; while a similar one, held in reserve for the machines
used in production, is fixed capital. Ricardo attributes
a somewhat different meaning to these two terms: he calls
fixed capital that which is slowly consumed, and circulating,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page159">[pg 159]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg159"></a>
that which disappears rapidly.<a href="#note_287" id="noteref_287" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">287</span></span></a> Fixed capital is, indeed, produced

most part, transformed again into circulating capital.<a href="#note_288" id="noteref_288" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">288</span></span></a> Besides,

and circulating capital to a country depends upon whether the
country is an advanced or only an advancing one. A people
with very much and very fixed capital are indeed very rich;
but run the risk of offering many vulnerable points to an
aggressive enemy, and of thus turning the easily jeopardized
mammon into an idol. To make a passing sacrifice of the
country that the people and the state may be saved, as did the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Capital is mainly the result of saving which withdraws new
products from the immediate enjoyment-consumption of their
possessor, and preserves them, or at least their value, to serve
as the basis of a lasting use.<a href="#note_291" id="noteref_291" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">291</span></span></a> As capital represents the
solidarity of the economic past, present and future, it, as a rule,
reaches back into the past and forward into the future, through
a period of time longer in proportion as its amount and efficiency
are greater.<a href="#note_292" id="noteref_292" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">292</span></span></a> Those producers, too, whose products perish
rapidly may, also, effect savings by exchanging their products
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page161">[pg 161]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg161"></a>
and capitalizing their counter-value. Thus, the actor, whose
playing leaves after it nothing but a memory, may use the
wheat received by him from a farmer who came to listen to
him, in the employment of an iron-worker, and invest the
product permanently in a railroad. The transformation may
be effected by means of money, bonds etc., but it is none the
less real on that account. Order, foresight and self-restraint
are the intellectual conditions precedent of saving and capital.
The childish and hail-fellow-well-met disposition which cares
only for the present is inimical to it. True, the desire of saving
can be developed only where there are legal guarantees to
ownership;<a href="#note_293" id="noteref_293" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">293</span></span></a> guarantees which are both the conditions precedent
and the effect of all economic civilization.<a href="#note_294" id="noteref_294" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">294</span></span></a> The Indians,
Esquimaux etc., had to be taught for the first time by the missionaries
and merchants—and it was with the greatest difficulty
it was done—to save their booty, and spare the natural sources
of their acquisition. Originally, they were, in the heat and
excitement of their wild hunting and fishing, wont to destroy
on the spot what they could not enjoy in the moment.<a href="#note_295" id="noteref_295" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">295</span></span></a> In the

But capital may be increased even without personal sacrifice;
as for instance, by mere occupation, as of certain goods,
not hitherto recognized as such. Thus, also, by the establishment
of valuable relations, the advantages of which either become
the common good of all; or which, because at the
exclusive command of one individual, obtain value in exchange.
The progress of civilization itself may increase the
value of existing capital. Thus, for instance, a house, considered
as capital, may double in value if a frequented street be
opened in its neighborhood. To this category belong all improvements
in the arts which enable existing capital to achieve
more than it could before. The invention of the compass increased
the value of the capital employed in the merchant
marine to an extent that cannot be calculated.<a href="#note_298" id="noteref_298" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">298</span></span></a> The increase

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All economic production generally demands the coöperation
of the three factors: external nature, labor and capital.
But with the political economist, labor is the principal thing;
and not merely because all capital presupposes labor, nor because
every combination of the three factors is an act of labor;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page164">[pg 164]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg164"></a>
but, in general, because <span class="tei tei-q">“the human mind's idea of means and
ends makes all goods goods for the first time.”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hufeland.</span></span>)
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Leaving the free forces of nature, surrounded by which we
live and work, out of consideration, and also the fact that all
raw material is due to nature, land is the indispensable foundation
of all economy. But how little can unassisted nature do
to satisfy human wants! How much less to produce goods
possessed of value in exchange! A virgin forest, for instance,
sold in its natural state, has, indeed, value in exchange, but
only because it is taken into account that it can be cleared,
and that there are means of transportation already existing.<a href="#note_301" id="noteref_301" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">301</span></span></a>
The greater part of the forces of nature are latent to nomads
and nations of hunters. When labor develops, they are set
free to assist it.<a href="#note_302" id="noteref_302" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">302</span></span></a> It is very seldom that any thing can be produced
without capital. Even the poorest gatherer of wild berries
needs a basket and must be clothed.<a href="#note_303" id="noteref_303" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">303</span></span></a> Were there no
capital, every individual would have to begin at the very beginning
every moment. Life would be possible only in a
tropical climate. No man, since the days of Adam, has been
able to labor, except on the condition that a considerable advance
of capital had been made upon him. There is not a
nail in all England, says Senior, which cannot directly or indirectly
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page165">[pg 165]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg165"></a>

The Three Great Periods Of A Nation's Economy.</span></h3>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The relation of the three factors to one another is necessarily
very different in different branches of production. For instance,
in the case of cattle-raising on a prairie, labor does
very little, land almost everything. Hence an extensive, thinly
populated country is best adapted to this species of production.
But where land is scarce, as in wealthy and populous
cities, human activity should be directed into those branches
of industry which need capital and labor, as manufactures and
the trades. (§ 198.)<a href="#note_305" id="noteref_305" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">305</span></span></a>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Looked at from this point of view, the history of the development
of the public economy of every people may be
divided into three great periods. In the earliest period, nature
is the element that predominates everywhere. The woods,
waters and meadows afford food almost spontaneously to a
scanty population. This is the Saturnian or golden age of
which the sagas tell. Wealth, properly speaking, does not
exist here, and those who do not possess a piece of land run
the risk of becoming completely dependent on, or even the
slave of a land owner. In the second period, that through
which all modern nations have passed since the later part of
the middle ages, the element, labor, acquires an ever increasing
importance. Labor favors the origin and development of
cities as well as exclusive rights, the rights of boroughs and
guilds by means of which labor is, so to speak, capitalized. A
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page166">[pg 166]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg166"></a>
middle class is formed intermediate between the serfs and the
owners of the soil. In the third period, capital, if we may so
speak, gives tone to everything. The value of land is vastly
increased by the expenditure of capital on it, and in manufactures,
machine labor preponderates over the labor of the human
hand.<a href="#note_306" id="noteref_306" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">306</span></span></a>
The national wealth undergoes a daily increase;
and it is the <span class="tei tei-q">“capitalism”</span> which first gives an independent
existence to the economic activity of man; just in the same
way that law is, as it were, emancipated from land-ownership,
from the church and the family only in the constitutional
state (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">Rechtsstaat</span></span>).<a href="#note_307" id="noteref_307" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">307</span></span></a>
But, during this period, the
middle class with its moderate ease and solid culture may decrease
in numbers, and colossal wealth be confronted with the
most abject misery.<a href="#note_308" id="noteref_308" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">308</span></span></a> Although these three periods may be
shown to exist in the history of all highly civilized countries,
the nations of antiquity, relatively speaking, never advanced
far beyond the second, even in their palmiest days. A great
part of that which is accomplished among us by means of capital
and of machines, the Greeks and Romans performed by
the labor of slaves. Leaving Christianity out of the question,
nearly all the minor differences between the public economy of
the ancients and that of the moderns may be reduced to this
fundamental distinction.<a href="#note_309" id="noteref_309" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">309</span></span></a><a href="#note_310" id="noteref_310" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">310</span></span></a>

between the deepest fundamental notions and the principal
branches of practical life. It is clear that every political
economist must construct his exposition of productiveness on
his prior notions of goods and value. We must, therefore,
draw a distinction between expositions which are logical but
altogether too narrow, and wholly erroneous ones.<a href="#note_311" id="noteref_311" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">311</span></span></a>

Thus, the Mercantile System admits every mode of applying
the three factors of production, but considers them
really productive only in so far as they increase the quantity
of the precious metals possessed by the nation, either through
the agency of mining at home, or by means of foreign trade.
This view stands and falls with the altogether too limited idea
of national wealth before mentioned (§ <a class="tei tei-ref pginternal" href="#Section_9">9</a>), which this system
advocated.<a href="#note_312" id="noteref_312" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">312</span></span></a> The majority of the followers of the Mercantile

Doctrine Of The Physiocrates.</span></h3>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The doctrine of the Physiocrates is to be explained in part
by a very natural reaction from the narrow-heartedness of the
Mercantile System, and at the same time, by a presentiment,
misunderstood, of the true theory of rent. (§ 150 ff.). Of
the six classes of labor mentioned above (§ <a class="tei tei-ref pginternal" href="#Section_38">38</a>),
those only are called productive which increase the quantity of raw material
useful for human ends. All the other classes, it matters not
how useful, are called sterile, salaried, because they draw their
income only from the superabundance of land-owners and the
workers of the soil. Tradesmen, in the narrower sense of the
term, produce only a change in the form of the material, the
higher value of which depends on the quantity of other material
consumed for the purposes of the tradesman's labor. If
any of this material is saved, the value of their products
sinks, although to the advantage of the economy of the whole
nation. In any case, industry could create no wealth, but only
make existing wealth more lasting. It might, so to speak, accumulate
the value of the quantity of food consumed during
the building of a house in the house itself.<a href="#note_313" id="noteref_313" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">313</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But if tradesmen really earned, in the value of their products,
only what they had consumed during their labor, it would
be difficult for them to find employers to provide them with
capital. Everyone will acknowledge, that a Thorwaldsen and
an ordinary stone-cutter, with the same block of marble, the
same implements, the same food, would necessarily, after the
same time, turn out exceedingly different values.<a href="#note_314" id="noteref_314" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">314</span></span></a> And, even
in the case that industry should add to the raw material only
precisely the same amount of value as had been consumed by
the workmen, can it be said that the work ceases to be productive
simply because it is consumed by the workmen themselves?
If that were so, agriculture even, would, in most
countries with a low civilization, be unproductive.<a href="#note_315" id="noteref_315" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">315</span></span></a>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Commerce, according to the theory of the Physiocrates,
only transfers already existing wealth from one hand to another.
What the merchants gain by it is at the cost of
the nation. Hence, it is desirable that this loss should be as
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page172">[pg 172]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg172"></a>
small as possible. Hence sterility!<a href="#note_316" id="noteref_316" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">316</span></span></a> But, the more important
branches of business, especially wholesale trade, are connected
with a transportation of goods (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Verri</span></span>), either from one place
or from one period of time, into another. Here the genuine
merchant speculates essentially on the difference of the values
in use which are afterwards greater than before.<a href="#note_317" id="noteref_317" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">317</span></span></a> The ice
shipped yearly from Boston to tropical lands met a much
more urgent and wide-spread want there than it would if it
had remained at home. And thus the storage of grain in
large quantities after a bountiful harvest withdraws, indeed,
an object of enjoyment from the consumption of the people;
but its sale, after a bad harvest, undoubtedly increases their
enjoyment in a much greater degree than it was before diminished.
Besides, the condition of both parties to the contract
is usually improved in all normal trade. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Condillac.</span></span>)<a href="#note_318" id="noteref_318" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">318</span></span></a> No one
parts with exchangeable goods unless they are of less use to
him than the ones he receives in return.<a href="#note_319" id="noteref_319" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">319</span></span></a> And so, the value in
use of a nation's resources is really increased by commerce. To
the other attributes of goods it adds one of the principal conditions
of all use, accessibility (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kudler</span></span>), with which it either
newly endows them, or which it increases in degree. To this
end, the merchant makes use of tools, just as the manufacturer
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page173">[pg 173]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg173"></a>
does. What spinning-wheels, looms and workshops are to the
latter, ships, warehouses, cranes etc., are to the former. If
production be not complete until the thing produced is made
fit for its last end, consumption, commerce may be looked upon
as the last link in the chain of productive labor. It, at the
same time, constitutes a series of intermediate links; as without
it no division of labor is possible, and without a division
of labor, no higher economic productiveness.<a href="#note_320" id="noteref_320" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">320</span></span></a> How commerce

former has no other object than to be played on by the latter?
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Garnier</span></span>.) Is it not strange that the hog-raiser should be
called productive, and the educator of man unproductive
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">List</span></span>); the apothecary, who prepares a salve which alleviates
for the moment, productive, the physician, unproductive, spite
of the fact that his prescription in relation to diet, or his surgical
operation, may radically cure the severest disease?

If the productiveness of an employment of the factors of
production be made to depend on whether it is attended by a
material result, no one will deny that the labor of the plowman,
for instance, is productive; and no one, of Adam Smith's
school, at least, that that of the clerk, who orders the raw
material for the owner of the manufactory, is. They have
participated indirectly in the production. But, has not the
servant of the state, who protects the property of its citizens,
or the physician, who preserves the health of the producer, an
equally mediate but indispensable share in it? The field-guard
who keeps the crows away, every one calls productive;
why, not, then, the soldier, who keeps away a far worse
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page175">[pg 175]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg175"></a>
enemy from the whole land? (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">McCulloch.</span></span>) But the entire
division of business into two branches, the one directly, and
the other indirectly productive, can be defended only as respects
certain kinds of goods. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Schmitthenner.</span></span>) The labor of
the judge, for instance, is only indirectly productive in the
manufacture of shoes, inasmuch as he guarantees the payment
of the shoemaker's account. On the other hand, the shoemaker
contributes only very indirectly to the general security
which the law affords, by protecting the judge's foot.<a href="#note_324" id="noteref_324" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">324</span></span></a>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Nor can any effectual inferiority of service be claimed,
simply because the productive power of one branch of business
is, measured by the duration of its results, greater than
another.<a href="#note_325" id="noteref_325" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">325</span></span></a> What is more perishable than a loaf of bread
bought for dinner? What more imperishable than the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">monumentum ære perennius</span></span> of a Horace? The labor
expended on persons and on relations (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">Verhältnissen</span></span>) is, both as to the extent
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page176">[pg 176]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg176"></a>
and duration of its results, much less capable of being
estimated than any other; but its capacity of accumulation
and its power of propagation are greater than any other. It
is in the domain of the <span class="tei tei-q">“immaterial,”</span> that man is most <span class="tei tei-q">“creative.”</span>
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lueder.</span></span>)<a href="#note_326" id="noteref_326" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">326</span></span></a>
Finally, neither should the greater indispensableness
of the more material branches of business be too
generally asserted. Agriculture produces grain which is indispensable,
and tobacco which is not; industry, cloth, as well as
lace; commerce draws from the same part of the world rhubarb
and edible bird's-nests; and so, to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">services</span></em> belong the indispensable
ones of the educator and judge, as well as those
of the rope-dancer and bear-leader, which can be dispensed
with.<a href="#note_327" id="noteref_327" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">327</span></span></a> Indeed, the dividing line between material and intellectual

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It should never be lost sight of, that the public economy of
a people should be considered an organism, which, when its
growth is healthy, always develops more varied organs, but
always in a due proportion, which are not only carried by the
body, but also in turn serve to carry it. The aggregate of
the wants of the entire public economy etc., is satisfied by the
aggregate activity of the people. Every individual who employs
his lands, labor or capital for the whole, receives his
share of the aggregate produce, whether he contributed or
not to the creation of the kind of produce in which he is paid.
Thus, in a pin-manufactory, the workman who is occupied
solely in making the heads of pins is not paid in pins or pin-heads,
but in a part of the aggregate result of the manufacture,
in money. Every department of business, therefore,
for the achievements of which there is a rational demand, and
which are remunerated in proportion to their deserts, has
labored productively. It is unproductive only when no one
will need what it has brought forth, or when no one will pay
for it; but, in this case, what is true of the writer without
readers—that he is unproductive—and of the singer without
hearers, is equally true of the peasant whose corn rots in
his granary, because he can find no sale for it.<a href="#note_331" id="noteref_331" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">331</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In this matter, again, there is an important difference to be
observed between private or individual economy and economy
in its widest sense, in the sense of a world-economy. The
productiveness of labor is estimated in the case of the former,
according to the value in exchange of its result; in the
case of the latter, according to its value in use. There is a
great number of employments which are very remunerative
to private individuals, but which are entirely unproductive,
and even injurious, so far as mankind is concerned; for the
reason that they take from others as much as, or even more
than they procure to those engaged in them. Here belong,
besides formal crimes against property, games of chance,<a href="#note_332" id="noteref_332" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">332</span></span></a>
usurious speculations (§ <a class="tei tei-ref pginternal" href="#Section_113">113</a>)
and measures taken to entice customers
away from other competitors. Again, scientific experiments,
means of communication etc., may be entirely unproductive
in the individual economy of the undertaker, and
yet be of more profit to mankind in general, than they have
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page180">[pg 180]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg180"></a>
cost the former.<a href="#note_333" id="noteref_333" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">333</span></span></a> In this respect the nation's economy holds
a middle place between individual economy and the world's
economy.<a href="#note_334" id="noteref_334" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">334</span></span></a>
Strictly speaking, only those employments should
be called productive which increase the world's resources.
Hence, the work of government should be called so, only in
so far as its expenses are covered by the taxes paid willingly
by the more reasonable portion of the citizens; and also only
in so far as its work is really necessary to the attainment of
its end.<a href="#note_335" id="noteref_335" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">335</span></span></a> The productiveness of an employment supposes,
also, that it is not carried on at the cost of other employments
which it is more difficult to do without. In a healthy nation
we may, in this matter, rely, to a certain extent, on the judgment
of public opinion, which knows how to appreciate, at
their just value, professional gamblers, pettifoggers and the
luxury of soldiers. The greater, freer and more cultivated a
nation is, the more probable is it that the productiveness of
private economy is also national-economical productiveness,
and that national-economical productiveness is world-economical
productiveness.<a href="#note_336" id="noteref_336" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">336</span></span></a>

Branches Of Productiveness.</span></h3>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Much always depends on the due proportion of the different
branches of productiveness to one another. Thus, Spain,
for instance, has remained poor under the most advantageous
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page181">[pg 181]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg181"></a>
circumstances in the world,<a href="#note_337" id="noteref_337" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">337</span></span></a> because it allowed a disproportionate
preponderance of personal services. The character of
the Spanish people has always given them a leaning towards
aristocratic pride and economic idleness. Tradesmen, in that
country, sought, as a rule, to amass merely enough to enable
them to live on the interest of their capital; after which they,
by way of preference, removed it into some other province,
where they might be considered as among the nobility; or
they withdrew into a monastery. Even in 1781, the Madrid
Academy thought it incumbent on it to propose a prize for the
best essay in support of the thesis: <span class="tei tei-q">“The useful trades in no
way detract from personal honor.”</span><a href="#note_338" id="noteref_338" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">338</span></span></a> During the century in
which the country was in its greatest glory, the whole people
were bent on being to all Europe what nobles, officers and officials
are to a single nation. <span class="tei tei-q">“Whoever wishes to make his
fortune,”</span> said Cervantes, <span class="tei tei-q">“let him seek the church, the sea (i.e.,
go as an adventurer to America) or the king's palace.”</span> Under
Philip III., there were in Spain nine hundred and eighty-eight
nunneries, and thirty-two thousand mendicant friars.
The number of monasteries trebled between 1574 and 1624,
and the number of monks increased in a yet greater ratio. A
great many of its manufactories, much of its commerce, and not
a few of its most important farms were controlled by foreigners,
especially by Italians. There were, it seems, in 1610, one
hundred and sixty thousand foreign tradesmen living in Castile.
In 1787, there were still 188,625 priests, monks, nuns,
etc.; 280,092 servants; 480,589 nobles; 964,571 day laborers;
987,187 peasants; 310,739 mechanics and manufacturers;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page182">[pg 182]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg182"></a>
34,339 merchants.<a href="#note_339" id="noteref_339" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">339</span></span></a> As a counterpart to this, the
United States had, in 1840, about 77.5 per cent. of its population engaged
in agriculture, 16.8 in manufactures and mining, 4.2 in shipping
and commerce, 1.3 in the learned professions.<a href="#note_340" id="noteref_340" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">340</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We might be tempted, in view of this contrast, to return
once more to the unproductiveness of personal services. It is
not, however, the direction given to the forces of production,
but the squandering of them, that is injurious. When the
Magyar, through mere vanity, drives a yoke of from four
to six horses where two are enough; or when, as in 1831,
Irish agriculture employed 1,131,715 workmen to produce a
value of thirty-six million pounds sterling, while that of Great
Britain<a href="#note_341" id="noteref_341" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">341</span></span></a> produced one hundred and fifty millions a year, and
employed only 1,055,982 workmen, these causes are as sure to
impoverish the country, as the waste of the Spaniards in supporting
such an army of clergy and servants. Of course, the
temptation to waste wealth on parks is greater than to waste
it in vegetable gardens! The probability that a man will ruin
himself by keeping too many servants is greater than that he
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page184">[pg 184]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg184"></a>
will do the same by employing too many operatives.<a href="#note_342" id="noteref_342" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">342</span></span></a> And
all the more, as there are many and especially important services
which regulate their own remuneration: thus, as a rule,
those of the statesman, those of the military in times of war,
and those of the priest in the age of superstition.<a href="#note_343" id="noteref_343" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">343</span></span></a>

that that application of the factors of production is
most productive, which, with the least expenditure of means,
satisfies the greatest want in the economy of a people. Here,
there is a continual change, corresponding precisely to the
change in wants and faculties. After a bad harvest, for instance,
the labor which procures grain from foreign countries
or the supplies of former years, is most productive; and, after
an earthquake which has destroyed a large city, the labor of
the builder. Agriculture is, as a rule, the more productive

The larger a tree grows to be, the more boughs and
branches does it put forth. The more perfect any species of
animal is, the more does it stand in need of a special organ for
each special purpose. And thus the division of labor has developed
and kept pace with the development of human society.
While Crusoe was obliged to provide for all his wants by his
own labor, we find that in the wildest Indian family the male is
employed in war, the chase, in fishing, in the manufacture of
arms and boats, and in the transportation of the latter during
long marches; the female, on the other hand, in the preparation
of food, in the hewing of wood, the curing of skins, the

In the middle age of a people, the division of labor is not
carried to any great extent. The courtiers of King Frotho
III. advised him to marry, <span class="tei tei-q">“since otherwise his majesty's ragged
linen would never be mended.”</span> Saint Dunstan, although
he occupied a high position in politics and in the Church, was
an excellent blacksmith, bell-founder and designer of ladies'
robes. Chriemhild in the Nibelungenlied was an industrious
and skillful milliner. In the corresponding period of Grecian
and Roman history, we find Penelope and Lucretia at
the loom, Nausicaa, a laundress, the daughter of the king of
the Lestrigons, fetching water from the spring, Odysseus, a
carpenter, a queen of Macedonia as a cook, and finally the
distaff of Tanaquil.<a href="#note_348" id="noteref_348" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">348</span></span></a> In the highlands of Scotland, in 1797,
there were a great many peasants all of whose clothing was
home-made, with the exception of their caps; nothing coming
from abroad except the tailor, his needles and iron tools generally.

tanner, shoemaker etc. of his own family:<a href="#note_349" id="noteref_349" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">349</span></span></a> every man jack of

In present England, on the other hand, the manufacture of
watches is divided into one hundred and two branches which
have to be specially learned; only the so-called <span class="tei tei-q">“watch-finisher”</span>
carries on other branches besides. In Wolverhampton, it may
happen that a man, employed in the manufacture of keys,
may not be able to make a whole key after an apprenticeship
of ten years, for the reason that during all that time he may
have been engaged only in filing.<a href="#note_351" id="noteref_351" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">351</span></span></a>
In English agriculture
there are, according to German notions, very few complete
wholes. A well-marked distinction exists there between the
cultivators of corn and breeders of cattle; and the latter
are again divided into breeders of young cattle, into fatteners
of cattle etc. Its industries are, in large part, separated
into provinces. Thus, linen manufactures are confined
almost exclusively to Leeds and Dundee, woolen manufactures,

On the division of labor depends all differences of estate

The advantages of all suitable division of labor, consequent
upon the natural differences of human faculties and dispositions,
are the following:

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page190">[pg 190]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg190"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The greater skill of the workman.</span></span> Even physically,
many capacities are, by an indefinite number of repetitions of
the same operation, enhanced to an extraordinary degree;
which, however, renders the performance of other operations
more difficult. Thus, the man who has developed his muscles
and hardened his hands working in a smithy, renders
himself incapable of becoming a violin-player or an operating
oculist.<a href="#note_355" id="noteref_355" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">355</span></span></a>
Here belongs especially the possibility of turning
every kind of labor-power to greatest account. Even children<a href="#note_356" id="noteref_356" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">356</span></span></a>
and old men may be made, in this way, to play a part
in the production of goods. It becomes practicable, too, to
relieve men endowed with superior faculties from common
labor, and allow them to devote themselves exclusively to the
development of the peculiar powers with which nature has
gifted them.<a href="#note_357" id="noteref_357" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">357</span></span></a>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
B. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">A great saving of time and trouble.</span></span> The simpler the
operation performed by a single workman, the more easily
is it learned; the smaller is the price paid or apprenticeship,
which depends on this, at least, that beginners perform poorer
work and are paid more poorly. <span class="tei tei-q">“The shortest way to the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page191">[pg 191]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg191"></a>
end is most easily found when the end itself is near, and can
be kept continually in view.”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">J. B. Say</span></span>.) Where the same
workman combines different operations, a great deal of time
is lost in changing tools etc. Besides, it always takes some
time for a workman to get rightly under way of his work.
The person who changes thus frequently becomes more easily
indolent. Lastly, there is a great number of operations which
demand the same aggregate amount of effort, no matter what
the number of objects on which they are performed. It is
thus, for instance, with shepherds, mail-carriers etc.<a href="#note_358" id="noteref_358" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">358</span></span></a> The
post carries a thousand letters with almost as much ease as
one; and the entire life of a wholesale dealer would scarcely
suffice to carry all the letters which he mails in a single day,
to their place of destination. During the middle ages, every
man was obliged to watch over his own personal safety and
the maintenance of his own rights; while in 1850, in Great
Britain, twenty-one million people are protected in their persons
and property, in an infinitely more effectual manner, and
at less cost, by fifteen thousand soldiers, and by a much smaller
number of policemen, whose place it is to preserve public
order. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Senior</span></span>.) Something similar takes place among merchants,
and it may be admitted as correct in principle, that
every new intermediary, freely recognized by both sides in
commerce,<a href="#note_359" id="noteref_359" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">359</span></span></a> makes labor better or less expensive.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
C. As the land of a country is, in a sense, the natural extension
of the national body, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the international division of labor</span></span>
affords an indirect means, but frequently an indispensable one,
of procuring the products of foreign countries and climates.<a href="#note_360" id="noteref_360" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">360</span></span></a>
If the English people wished to obtain themselves, and without
having recourse to any intermediary, the quantity of tea
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page192">[pg 192]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg192"></a>
which they annually consume, it is possible that its whole agricultural
population would not suffice to procure it; while, at
present, it is obtained by the labor of forty-five thousand industrial
workmen. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Senior</span></span>.) Moreover, the division of labor
increases not only the aptitude of the workman but also his
incentive to productive labor, since it guarantees to every one
the certainty of being able, by means of exchange, to enjoy
the productions of every other person.<a href="#note_361" id="noteref_361" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">361</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is by its division, that labor, considered as a factor of production,
is raised to the highest degree of efficiency. Its results
in any given industry are, therefore, more important in
proportion as the element labor predominates in it. Hence,
these results are much smaller, in agriculture, for instance, than
in the trades, or in personal services.<a href="#note_362" id="noteref_362" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">362</span></span></a> The most expert sower or
harvester cannot be employed the whole year through in sowing
or harvesting. Some kind of rotation of crops, some kind of
combination of tillage and stock-raising is necessary to every
agriculturist. On this depends the importance of the technic
secondary industries of agriculture, which are, in principle,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page193">[pg 193]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg193"></a>
opposed to the division of labor. Hence, too, almost any person
engaged in a trade, no matter of what kind, supposes a
greater number of customers than a tiller of the land of the
same rank.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The more labor is divided, the greater is the amount of capital
necessary to it.<a href="#note_363" id="noteref_363" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">363</span></span></a>
It may be even said, that all preparatory
labor becomes capital in its relation to subsequent labor. If
ten isolated workmen can produce ten dozen articles of any
kind, daily, and, after the introduction of a more efficient division
of labor, fifty dozen, the employer must provide them, in
the latter case, not only with five times as much capital, but
probably with fifty times as much, as then, five hundred dozen
are making continually.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But it is the extent of the market especially which determines
the limits of the division of labor; for there is a direct
and necessary relation between the division of labor and the
exchange of its surplus. Hence, the division of labor may be
carried farthest in the case of those products which are most
easily transported from place to place, and which, at the same
time, possess the utility that is most widely recognized. The
smallness of the market may depend upon the scantiness of
the population, or upon its scattered condition;<a href="#note_364" id="noteref_364" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">364</span></span></a> upon their
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page194">[pg 194]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg194"></a>
smaller ability to pay, or upon the bad means of communication
at their disposal.<a href="#note_365" id="noteref_365" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">365</span></span></a> Hence it is, that in villages, small cities, and
still more on isolated farms, many branches of business are
carried on by one person, which are divided among many in
larger cities; and this is especially true in the case of businesses
which have a chiefly local demand.<a href="#note_366" id="noteref_366" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">366</span></span></a>
While, in small places,
the barber is also frequently the physician, in larger ones there
are dentists, oculists, accoucheurs, surgeons etc.<a href="#note_367" id="noteref_367" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">367</span></span></a>; and while, in
the former, the tavern keeper is both dry goods merchant and
grocer, there are, in the latter, tea merchants, cigar-dealers,
dealers in mourning goods (in London childbed-linen warehouses)
etc., and hotels for all the different classes of travelers.
There can be a distinct class of porters, hack-men etc., only
where commerce is very active.<a href="#note_368" id="noteref_368" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">368</span></span></a>
And even in cities like Paris,
where the costly industries that minister to luxury, that of the
jeweler, for instance, admit of only a limited division of labor,
this effect depends on the smallness of the market; a market, indeed,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page195">[pg 195]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg195"></a>
which geographically may extend over the whole earth,
but which, in an economic sense, must always remain small,
on account of the small number of customers who have the
ability to pay for their products. The real wonders produced
by the division of labor and the employment of machinery we
must look for in the manufacture of the cheapest and commonest
commodities.<a href="#note_369" id="noteref_369" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">369</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Whoever, therefore, would increase the division of labor
among the people, must, first of all, extend their market; and
this is done most efficiently by improving the means of communication.
Even in our day, it is over the water-highroads
that the heaviest articles are carried with the least
expenditure of force;<a href="#note_370" id="noteref_370" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">370</span></span></a>
but where civilization is not advanced,
these highroads possess still greater advantages, because
of their safety, convenience and priority. And here is
the explanation of the intimate connection of the beginnings of
all civilizations with the existence, near the scene of such beginnings,
of good natural water-roads. <span class="tei tei-q">“Even the wildest inhabitant
of the sea coast very soon obtains the idea of distance,
which is altogether wanting to the inhabitant of the primeval
forest. No sooner does he catch sight of the far-off island than
his yearning after the distant assumes a well-defined character.
Bits of wood floating past him suggest to his mind the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page196">[pg 196]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg196"></a>
best material to buoy himself up upon the water, and a fish
the best form for his craft.”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Klemm.</span></span>) Hence the Mediterranean
sea, especially the eastern portion, with the various
peoples and products of its coasts, with its numerous
islands, peninsulas and bays, its easy navigation, but little influenced
by the tides or by ocean currents, was the principal
seat of ancient civilization.<a href="#note_371" id="noteref_371" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">371</span></span></a>
The literal meaning of Attica is
coast-land. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Strabo.</span></span>) The colonization of a new country is
wont, where possible, to begin on the coast, especially on islands
near the coast; and to follow the course of rivers into the interior.
Even whole continents occupy, for the most part, in
the history of the world, the position assigned them by their
coast-development.<a href="#note_372" id="noteref_372" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">372</span></span></a>
While it is hard to determine whether,
in the case of the European continent, its limbs predominate
or its trunk, Africa may be said to be a trunk without members.
Its islands, most of them insignificant in themselves,
are almost entirely cut off from it by ocean currents. This explains
why Madagascar had not, by any means, the influence
on African civilization which Crete, Sicily and Britain
have had on the civilization of Europe. Asia occupies, in this
respect, about a middle position between Europe and Africa.
The trunk of that continent bears to its members about the
proportion of 670,000 to 150,000 square miles. And what is
worst of all, the middle of the whole is an almost insurmountable
wall between north, south, east and west Asia. Hence
the tenacious peculiarity and isolated development of the
Chinese, Malayan, Indian and Arabic civilizations; while the
three peninsulas of southern Europe, for instance, have affected
one another so largely, and in so many different ways.<a href="#note_373" id="noteref_373" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">373</span></span></a>
The northern hemisphere compared with the southern, presents
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page197">[pg 197]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg197"></a>
a contrast similar to that between Europe and Africa, or
of the rich coast-groups of the Atlantic compared with the
poor ones of the Pacific.<a href="#note_374" id="noteref_374" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">374</span></span></a> But it is most especially, large,
well-watered plains that are best adapted to the construction
of roads, and thus to facilitate the division of labor. And
while we find, in many countries, that the mountainous regions
reached a certain stage of development earlier than any
others, because they were more easily protected by military
force, we find, too, that even here, plains, have, for the most
part, had the largest share of power and of civilization (northern
Italy, northern France, the plains of Switzerland and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page198">[pg 198]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg198"></a>
north Germany). See § <a class="tei tei-ref pginternal" href="#Section_36">36</a>.<a href="#note_375" id="noteref_375" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">375</span></span></a> We must not, however, fail to
consider the reverse side of the picture of the great highways
of the world. The same reasons that raise them to the dignity
of lines of commerce, make them lines of war; and even
the contagion of great plagues and of the ruling vices follows,
as a rule, the avenues of trade.

There are hardships often attending the highly developed
division of labor, the dark and bright sides of which are most
strikingly observable only in large cities. However, when it
is charged with adding to the natural inequality of men, the
accusation can be met only by the answer, that, without the
division of labor, we should be all equally poor and equally
coarse; for each one would be absorbed by the necessity of
providing for his lower wants, and no one would be in a way
to develop his higher faculties. Even the poorest man has
more enjoyment in consequence of the division of labor, than
he could have living in a state of isolation from his fellow men.
The most wretched among us, the invalid without property
of any kind, the father of a family with more children than
he can support, would simply starve in the primeval forest.

Those socialists who never tire of preaching <span class="tei tei-q">“association,”</span>
overlook for the most part, the great, free association which
our needs, wants or tastes are ever changing, and which is
given us, as of course, by the division of labor.<a href="#note_376" id="noteref_376" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">376</span></span></a> Yet the skill
produced by the division of labor is unavoidably connected
with a corresponding one-sidedness. The Russians, for instance,
are exceedingly apt, but they rarely distinguish themselves
in any thing.<a href="#note_377" id="noteref_377" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">377</span></span></a> Love of his avocation,

shown that the Neapolitans and Italians, in general, exhibit great skill when they work
alone; but that when a great many of them work together,
they become rapidly confused. The English, on the other
hand, are slow to learn anything new, or to overcome unlooked
for difficulties; but they have no equals as workmen in organized
industries.<a href="#note_379" id="noteref_379" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">379</span></span></a>
The difficulty experienced in seeking a new
calling, where a high division of labor obtains, arises as much
from the fact that each person here has received a more one-sided
training, as from the necessity he is under of competing
from the first with only consummate workers. Rousseau's
school has laid too much stress on the tendency of higher civilization
to diminish individual independence. <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">Quand

Schleiermacher rightly declared all human action which is
purely mechanical, through which man becomes a living tool
(slave!) immoral. When the division of labor has reached
this point, machines should take the place of men. The morality
of a profession may be measured by the degree in which it corresponds with the universal
calling of the race.<a href="#note_384" id="noteref_384" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">384</span></span></a> It is
not, therefore, a piece of inconsistency but rather a deeply felt
want, when, where civilization is at its highest, so many demands
are made that the division of labor should take a retrograde
path. The practice of gymnastic exercises by the
sedentary classes, universal military duty, the participation of
citizens in municipal government and in political affairs, of laymen
in the government of the church, of the wealthy in the
administration of charity; all these things are, from a materialistic
stand-point, considered a great squandering of time. It
may be, that, if the division of labor were more rigidly carried
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page202">[pg 202]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg202"></a>
out, we might, by its means, obtain more perfect results
with less economic expense. But the whole man is of more
importance than the sum of his achievements and enjoyments.
(Luke, 9:25.) Wo to the nation where only jurists have a
developed sense of the right, where political judgment and
cultivated patriotism are the portion of only officials and placemen,
where only the standing army has warlike courage, and
the clergy only conscious religiousness; where parents leave
all care for education to the teachers of the various branches
of learning, and where physical vigor is to be found only
among the proletarians. Hence there is nothing more ruinous
than premature one-sided education in a single trade or
profession—a thing which often happens from poverty before
the foundations of the general education becoming a human
being have been laid. The higher a man's position, the
more should he, so to speak, be a representative of the whole
human race. Who, for instance, would wish to see a ruler
brought up as men are to a special branch of science or to a
special profession?<a href="#note_385" id="noteref_385" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">385</span></span></a><a href="#note_386" id="noteref_386" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">386</span></span></a> The best corrective for the one-sidedness

different kinds of labor, one of which, however, demands thrice

that, in order that the business may be properly carried on, so

Of Work.</span></h3>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Coöperation in time is of equal importance: the principle of
the stability, or of the continuity of labor. When a workman
dies, it is necessary to be able to calculate on a substitute. It
is well known that it is much harder to begin a business, than
it is, afterwards, to improve and enlarge it; and this, the more
complicated it is. A new enterprise will take root easily, only
where there are several similar ones already in existence; a
new manufacturing establishment, for instance, where by the
existence of other such establishments, the requisite habits of
the workmen, of capitalists and of the public in general, have
been previously developed. The skill of workmen is propagated
especially by observation and the personal emulation of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page205">[pg 205]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg205"></a>
the young; whence it is, that the introduction of new industries
is best made by the immigration of skilled workmen.<a href="#note_390" id="noteref_390" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">390</span></span></a>
Hence the baleful influence of such interruptions, as for instance,
the repeal of the edict of Nantes. Hence too, it is,
that despotism and the reign of the populace are so unfavorable
to the economy of a country, where there can be no guarantee
of a consistent observance and development of the laws.
To the best applications of the principle of the continuity
of labor belong the church-building of the middle ages, the
national canals, the street and fortification systems of modern
times; all of which have been created only by the coöperation
of several generations to the same end.<a href="#note_391" id="noteref_391" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">391</span></span></a> The most striking
means by which such a coöperation has been advanced in
modern times is public credit, <span class="tei tei-q">“a draft on posterity;”</span> yet, all
saving is, in principle, the same. The most powerful element
in the coöperation in time of labor is the economy in common
of the family, although it differs in degree, according to the
different kinds of family inheritance. Where, as among the
English middle classes, it is customary to secure the business
property of the family to one child by will, and to entrust the
conduct of the business, during the life of the father, to the
devisee, to provide for the other children by insurance, by savings
etc., made from the surplus of the business, there may be
old firms which remain always new, however; because they
combine the experience of age with the energy of youth, and
are never broken up by a division of the inheritance. But the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page206">[pg 206]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg206"></a>
compulsory equality of heirs, which actually obtains in France,
compels almost every new generation to begin with a new
firm. (See § <a class="tei tei-ref pginternal" href="#Section_85">85</a> seq.)<a href="#note_392" id="noteref_392" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">392</span></span></a>

harder to acquire the first thousand than the second million.”</span>
Abstraction made of the conditions of capital and of the market,
the limit up to which the growing magnitude of an enterprise
becomes more advantageous, lies in the increasing difficulty
of superintendence. Numberless commercial improvements,
such as the post-office, railroads, telegraphs, exchange, banks
etc., have operated powerfully to extend these limits. It is
frequently possible, even in small enterprises, to secure the advantages
of large enterprises, by association among those concerned.
They must, of course, possess the necessary capital.
If they have not got it, as property, they must borrow it. It
is, of course, peculiarly difficult here to preserve the necessary
unity, without which the coöperation of labor becomes
the confusion of labor. The more moral and intelligent the
participants are and the simpler the business, the more extensive
may it become, and the more probable will be its success.

through war. It is not possible to calculate how much

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page209">[pg 209]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg209"></a>

for either? Such an advance, where there is no security in

But the man who is destitute of all property can offer nothing
but the productive power of himself or of his family.<a href="#note_400" id="noteref_400" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">400</span></span></a> And

food most readily. We need only cite the instance of the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In all very low stages of civilization, the greatest absence
of the feeling of wants, and the greatest indolence, are wont
to prevail, and in the highest degree. As soon as their merest
necessities are provided for, men begin to look upon labor as
a disgraceful occupation, and indolence as the highest kind of
enjoyment. (§ <a class="tei tei-ref pginternal" href="#Section_41">41</a>, 213 ff.) Sustained and voluntary efforts,
in any number, then become possible only by the creation of
new wants; but these new wants suppose a higher civilization.
Escape from this sorry circle is then effected in the most humane
manner, through the agency of foreign teachers; inasmuch
as the representatives of a more highly cultivated people
(missionaries, merchants etc.), by their own example, make
the nation acquainted with more wants, and at the same time
help toward their satisfaction.<a href="#note_404" id="noteref_404" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">404</span></span></a> But, in the case of nations
whose civilization is completely isolated, or having intercourse
only with others equally low, progress is the creature of
force exclusively. The barbarous isolation of families ceases
when the strongest and most powerful force the weaker
into their service. It is now that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the division of labor really
begins</span></em>: the victor devotes himself entirely to work of a higher
order, to statesmanship, war, worship etc.; the very doing of
which is generally a pleasure in itself. The vanquished perform
the lower. The one-half of the people are forced to
labor for something beyond their own brute wants. And it
is, here as elsewhere, the first step that costs.<a href="#note_405" id="noteref_405" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">405</span></span></a> (§ <a class="tei tei-ref pginternal" href="#Section_45">45</a>.)

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is not to be supposed that slavery, at this stage, is so
oppressive even to those who have been deprived of their
freedom. The feeling of moral degradation which slavery,
abstraction even made of its abuses, awakens in us, is unknown
in a very uncivilized age.<a href="#note_406" id="noteref_406" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">406</span></span></a> The child willingly obeys the
orders of strangers, and is hired out to service by his parents
etc. The want or craving for liberty keeps pace with the intellectual
growth of a people. The systematic over-working
of servants or slaves, in the interest of their masters, is scarcely
thinkable in an uncultured age, when, in the absence of commercial
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page213">[pg 213]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg213"></a>
intercourse, every family consumes what it produces.<a href="#note_407" id="noteref_407" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">407</span></span></a>
The only thing which the slave has to fear is an occasional
outburst of tyranny on the part of the master, a thing which
is far from unfrequent in all the relations of low civilizations.
Fear restrains masters to a certain extent; for, in those early

to the family to keep up their number, which makes their
condition much more endurable, and which supposes that it
has been made more endurable in other respects beforehand.
Modern states, are, as a rule, larger than the ancient were.
The Germans had, long before the time of Charlemagne,
treated prisoners of war of German origin more mildly than
those of Gallic or Slavic origin.<a href="#note_411" id="noteref_411" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">411</span></span></a> The condition of the latter
even improved from the time that nations began to think of
making permanent conquests. Since the Slavic wars of the
tenth century, certainly since the Lithuanian contests, it seems
that prisoners of war were not reduced to slavery.<a href="#note_412" id="noteref_412" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">412</span></span></a>
Chivalry,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page215">[pg 215]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg215"></a>
and allowing prisoners to go free, on their word of honor,
contributed largely to this result.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The more productive agriculture is, the more numerous the
wants of land owners, the more extensive the division of labor
and commercial intercourse become, the easier it is for a large
class of the community to obtain support for themselves and
families without cultivating land of their own. (Wages.)
When exchanges through the medium of money become customary,
the chief argument for slavery disappears; and the
strong, rich and able man can, without having recourse to
force, command the labor of other men. Every further advance
in economic culture must necessarily help forward in this
direction. Thus, without the plow, for instance, we should all
be really only so many <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">glebæ adscripti</span></span>. It is due especially to
the ever increasing perfection of tools, machines and operations,
that the slave of antiquity was transformed into the serf

modern times.<a href="#note_413" id="noteref_413" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">413</span></span></a> It is more particularly to be remarked, that

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Slavery promotes the division of labor only in the very
beginning. The more dependent the slave is, the worse he
works. Whatever he spoils or allows to go to waste injures
only his master. Hence it is that slave-husbandry is only one
degree removed from what the Germans call <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">Raubbau</span></span>, and
which means, as nearly as we can translate it, the most
thoughtless and wasteful management possible.<a href="#note_414" id="noteref_414" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">414</span></span></a> Whatever
he consumes is simply so much gain to himself. Industry
and skill are injurious to him, because, if remarkable for these
qualities, his master exacts more work from him and is
more adverse to setting him at liberty. Instead of the numberless
incentives of the free workman: care for the future,
for his family, honor and comfort, the slave is generally
moved by one—the fear of ill-treatment, and to this he gradually
becomes insensible.<a href="#note_415" id="noteref_415" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">415</span></span></a> The division of labor demanded
by manufactures, and which is to be found for the most part
only where each person is at liberty to choose his own avocation,
is scarcely supposable where slavery, in the strict sense
of the word, prevails. The same is true of the spirit of invention
and improvement.<a href="#note_416" id="noteref_416" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">416</span></span></a>
And even where the milder <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">glebæ
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page217">[pg 217]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg217"></a><span style="font-style: italic">
adscriptio</span></span> obtains, the division of labor is much hindered.
Hence, competent judges all agree on the badness of slave
labor;<a href="#note_417" id="noteref_417" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">417</span></span></a> which, as for instance in the United States, was used
only where the slaves were crowded together in large numbers
and could therefore be easily superintended. And not
only are the slaves themselves indolent, but their masters as
well; more particularly in slave countries where all labor is
considered disgraceful. What must be the national husbandry
of a people, one half of whom refuse to do anything that is right
and proper, through malice, and the other half through pride!
As soon as, on account of increased population and consequent
increased consumption, this enormous waste of force
can be endured no longer, free workmen become more profitable,
not only to themselves and to the whole community, but
to the greater number of the individuals who compose it.<a href="#note_418" id="noteref_418" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">418</span></span></a>
On the Bernstoff estates the quantity of rye harvested before
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page218">[pg 218]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg218"></a>
and after emancipation was as 3:8-⅓; of barley-corn as 4:9-⅓;
of oat-grain as 2-⅔:8.<a href="#note_419" id="noteref_419" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">419</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The owners of serfs, especially, are apt to be very wasteful
of their labor, because they imagine that they obtain it gratis.
Tucker has made a curious calculation tending to show that
when civilization reaches a certain point, the master's self-interest
leads to emancipation. In Russia, where there are
seventy-five persons to the English square mile, it seemed to
him that serfdom was still a good economic speculation. In
western Europe, where there were one hundred and ten persons
to the square mile, freedom, in all relations of master and
servant, he considered more advantageous to all parties. Emancipation
began in England in the fourteenth century, when that
country had a population of forty to the square mile, and was
completed in the seventeenth, when the population was ninety-two
to the square mile.<a href="#note_420" id="noteref_420" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">420</span></span></a> Tucker concludes, that the turning
point comes, when the population is relatively to the number
of square miles as 66:1.<a href="#note_421" id="noteref_421" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">421</span></span></a> Such a calculation cannot, of course,
be universally true. The free workman can usually command
a much larger portion of the sum total of economic profits
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page219">[pg 219]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg219"></a>
than can the slave or serf, who must be satisfied with the minimum
necessary to support life.<a href="#note_422" id="noteref_422" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">422</span></span></a>
Hence, free labor is more
profitable to masters only when production in general is so
much enhanced thereby that a greater quantity of goods falls
to their share also. But this will always be the case where
workmen are capable of development.<a href="#note_423" id="noteref_423" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">423</span></span></a>

At the same time, the same degree of servitude becomes
more and more oppressive to the bondman as civilization advances.
The greater his intellectual progress, the more does
he feel the want of liberty, and the more keenly he experiences
the degradation of his condition. The development of luxury
digs a gulf between master and servant which grows wider
every day. (§ 227 ff.) As commerce extends, it becomes
more profitable for the master to exact excessive work from
his slave. In the West Indies, it was a problem which every
slaveholder solved for himself, whether, by immoderately increased
production, which cost the lives of many slaves, the
gain in sugar was greater than the loss occasioned by the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page220">[pg 220]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg220"></a>

This explains why it is that, in all countries, the power of
the state, in a period of transition towards a higher civilization,
has endeavored to render slavery milder. Great credit is
due the Church in this regard. It soon extinguished slavery
entirely in Scandinavia,<a href="#note_427" id="noteref_427" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">427</span></span></a> and in portions of Europe it abolished

not be killed by their masters at pleasure,<a href="#note_429" id="noteref_429" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">429</span></span></a> but that they should
be brought before a tribunal of justice. (The manorial tribunals
of more recent times.) Moreover, the numberless holidays
of the church operated greatly in favor of the bondmen.
Pope Alexander III. recommended their gradual emancipation.<a href="#note_430" id="noteref_430" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">430</span></span></a>
One of the principal steps in the way of progress was
made when they could no longer be sold singly, but only with
the village or on the estate to which they belonged.<a href="#note_431" id="noteref_431" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">431</span></span></a> The

reducing a great number of freemen to their level.<a href="#note_432" id="noteref_432" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">432</span></span></a> This
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page222">[pg 222]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg222"></a>
could not be effected without a real amelioration of slavery;
and, later, when the feudal aristocracy declined, the older serfs
were, with those who had been formerly free, raised from their
abject condition. The sense of chivalry would not permit a
lord to be served by a bondman. The old adage <span class="tei tei-q">“the serf
lives to serve and serves to live,”</span> by degrees, lost its force.
Serfs were required to perform certain tasks on the lands of
their master and to pay him a certain quantity of the produce
of their own. Heriots (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">mortuarium</span></span>), which became usual
from the 8th century (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">J. Grimm</span></span>), may be considered evidence
that even bondmen were permitted to acquire and hold
property in their own right. Thus was one of the chief disadvantages
of slavery, in an economic sense, removed.<a href="#note_433" id="noteref_433" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">433</span></span></a> It
may be affirmed, as characteristic of the aristocracy of feudal
times, that they treated those, who like the serfs were entirely
at their mercy, with much more consideration than those who
were free, and, although dependent on them, had certain rights
guaranteed by contract. The absolute monarchy found in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page223">[pg 223]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg223"></a>
nearly all nations, at the opening of modern times, was forced
by its struggle with the mediæval aristocracy to favor the
emancipation of the serfs and of the lower classes. Even in
Russia, Iwan III. (1462-1505) seems to have restored to the
peasantry the right of migration, of which they had been deprived
by the invasion of the Mongols, nor did they lose it
again until the great troubles at the beginning of the seventeenth
century, which gave the ruling power to the nobility.<a href="#note_434" id="noteref_434" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">434</span></span></a>

Where civilization has reached its highest development, the
irresistible power of public opinion, governed by the ideas of
the universal brotherhood of man and of democratic equality,
causes the abolition of all irredeemable and of all hereditary
relations of servitude.<a href="#note_435" id="noteref_435" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">435</span></span></a><a href="#note_436" id="noteref_436" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">436</span></span></a><a href="#note_437" id="noteref_437" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">437</span></span></a>

It cannot be doubted, that an entirely direct leap from complete
servitude to complete freedom may be attended by many
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page225">[pg 225]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg225"></a>
evils. No man is <span class="tei tei-q">“born free,”</span><a href="#note_438" id="noteref_438" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">438</span></span></a> but only with a faculty for
freedom; but this faculty must be developed. The knowledge
and respect for law, and the self-control, which are the
conditions and limits of freedom, are never acquired without
labor, seldom without the making of grave mistakes, and never
except through the practice of them. As a rule, both parties,
masters as well as servants, would like to get rid immediately
of all the inconveniences of the former condition and yet continue
to enjoy its advantages. The servant, for instance, will
now yield no more the specific obedience of former times, but
demands still specific mildness from the land-owner, or loaner
of capital, his former master. It is inevitable that there should
be complaints on both sides.<a href="#note_439" id="noteref_439" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">439</span></span></a>

unrecallable. Hence it is, that all hope of a better condition

Even in antiquity, the principal nations of the world could
not keep the humanizing influence of civilization from making
itself felt on their slaves. And if they did not go so far
as to bring about the total abolition of slavery, it is unhesitatingly
to be attributed to their religious inferiority.<a href="#note_441" id="noteref_441" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">441</span></span></a> In
Athens, during the Peloponnesian war, it was almost impossible
to distinguish the slaves from the poorer freemen by their
looks or dress. Their treatment was mild in proportion as
desertion was easier by reason of the smallness of the state or
the frequency of war. It was forbidden to beat them; and only a court of justice could
punish them with death.<a href="#note_442" id="noteref_442" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">442</span></span></a> Emancipation,

In most countries the servant system developed itself gradually
out of serfdom, or of some condition of tutelage analogous
thereto. This is seen most clearly in the long continuance
of forced service, by which the subjects of the lord of the fee
were compelled to allow their children to remain in the court
of the lord as servants, either without any remuneration whatever,
or for very low wages fixed by long continued custom.<a href="#note_454" id="noteref_454" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">454</span></span></a>
Here, also, belongs the right of correction, so generally accorded
to masters in former times. In the higher stages of
civilization, the whole relation is wont to be resolved more and
more into freedom of competition; and this process is wont to
take place earliest and most strikingly in the cities. Where
vast numbers of men are brought together, demand and supply
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page230">[pg 230]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg230"></a>
of services meet most easily. The nearer in the course of
this development the servant system approaches to piece-wages
and day-wages, the shorter does the customary (presumptive)
duration of the contract last,<a href="#note_455" id="noteref_455" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">455</span></span></a> the more voluntary is

tend to be limited to single acts of service agreed upon

cities, the more movable and more democratic character of
which finds expression in this, that they have extended the
use of personal services to a lower circle of consumers than
could previously have thought of employing them. In English
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page231">[pg 231]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg231"></a>
agriculture this transition was completed mainly in the
third decade of this century. The change was unquestionably
favorable to the improvement of the art of agriculture, but it
was frequently damaging to the social relation existing between the rich
and the poor in the country.<a href="#note_458" id="noteref_458" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">458</span></span></a> In Germany, the
sale of the public domains, conscription and <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">Landwehr</span></span> duty have operated in this
direction.<a href="#note_459" id="noteref_459" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">459</span></span></a> Hence
it is, for instance, that in Prussia, the servants, in 1816, were 15.18 per cent. of the
entire male population over 14 years of age, and 17.84 per
cent. of the entire female population over 14 years of age. In
1861, on the other hand, there were only 11.88 and 12.93 per
cent., respectively, while the number of day laborers and workmen,
in the same time, increased from 16.29 per cent. males, and 10.87 per cent.
females, to 20.95 and 16.65 per cent., respectively.<a href="#note_460" id="noteref_460" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">460</span></span></a>
In most civilized countries, the grade of society
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page232">[pg 232]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg232"></a>
from which servants are recruited grows lower and lower as
the spirit of independence extends to the deeper strata of humanity.<a href="#note_461" id="noteref_461" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">461</span></span></a>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The servant class may continue a long time yet to be a
school of development for those of the lower classes, who, ripe
in body, are not intellectually independent; just as the duty
of bearing arms has been a school of improvement for all male
youth. Life-long servants are as seldom to be desired as life-long
soldiers.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In most places, the long transition period from complete
bondage to free competition was governed by a police system
of wardship, which was very unfavorable to the servant class.
Such especially was the provision that all young people of the
lower classes, who could not expressly show that they were
employed under the paternal roof or at some trade, should be
compelled to seek some outside or inland work;<a href="#note_462" id="noteref_462" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">462</span></span></a> such also
was the strict prohibition of <span class="tei tei-q">“usurious”</span> wage-claims, and
the <span class="tei tei-q">“decoying”</span> of servants from their masters.<a href="#note_463" id="noteref_463" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">463</span></span></a> Besides, a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page233">[pg 233]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg233"></a>
great many provisions relating to servants, and based on views
belonging to an older economic condition, were intended to throw obstacles
in the way of farm hands and country servants<a href="#note_464" id="noteref_464" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">464</span></span></a>
becoming servants in towns; and, on the other hand, to
facilitate the speedy abandonment of service in all cases in
which the servant desired to marry.<a href="#note_465" id="noteref_465" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">465</span></span></a> All these preferences
in favor of one class of contractors, and at the cost of another,
are radically opposed to the modern political spirit. The laws
relating to servants are wont, in our day, to have but one object,
the prevention, by registration with the police, of fraud
and breach of contract, and of all strife and litigation by the
legally formulating of the conditions which are very frequently
tacitly understood.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The ideal of the relation of master and servant is attained
when it is considered by both as a part of the life of a Christian
family.<a href="#note_466" id="noteref_466" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">466</span></span></a> Hence, benevolence on the one side and devotedness
on the other, fidelity on both sides, disinterested care for
the present and future interests each of the other <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">tanquam

this state of mutual feeling is best furthered by the patriarchal
system, by a police system, or by free competition, it is scarcely
possible to say. It may, however, be affirmed that it depends
upon a mutual and continued denial of self not easy to attain.

In opposition to this, the idea of a community of goods has
found favor, especially in times when the four following conditions
met:<a href="#note_471" id="noteref_471" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">471</span></span></a>

A. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">A well-defined, confrontation of rich and-poor.</span></span> So long
as there is a middle class of considerable numbers between
them, the two extremes are kept, by its moral force, from coming
into collision. There is no greater preservative against
envy of the superior classes and contempt for the inferior, than
the gradual and unbroken fading of one class of society into
another. <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Sperate miseri, cavete

social organization, we find the utmost and freshest productive

bottom are straining every nerve to rise, and those higher up,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page238">[pg 238]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg238"></a>
not to fall below. But where the rich and the poor are separated
by an abyss which there is no hope of ever crossing,
how pride on the one side and envy on the other rage! and
especially in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">foci</span></span> of industry, the great cities, where the
deepest misery is found side by side with the most brazen-faced
luxury, and where the wretched themselves conscious of
their numbers, mutually excite their own bad passions. It
cannot, unfortunately, be denied, that when a nation has attained
the acme of its development, we find a multitude of
tendencies prevailing to make the rich richer and the poor, at
least relatively poorer, and thus to diminish the numbers of
the middle class from both sides; unless, indeed, remedial influences
are brought to bear and to operate in a contrary
direction.<a href="#note_472" id="noteref_472" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">472</span></span></a>

B. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">A high degree of the division of labor</span></span>, by which, on the
one hand, the mutual dependence of man on man grows ever
greater, but by which, at the same time, the eye of the uncultured
man becomes less and less able to perceive the connection
existing between merit and reward, or service and remuneration.
Let us betake ourselves in imagination to Crusoe's
island. There, when one man, after the labor of many
months, has hollowed out a tree into a canoe, with no tools
but an animal's tooth, it does not occur to another who, in the
meantime was, it may be, sleeping on his bear-skin, to contest
the right of the former to the fruit of his labor. How different
this from the condition of things where civilization is advanced,
as it is in our day; where the banker, by a single
stroke of his pen, seems to earn a thousand times more than
a day-laborer in a week; where, in the case of those who loan
money on interest, their debtors too frequently forget how
laborious was the process of acquiring the loaned capital by
the possessors, or their predecessors in ownership. More especially,
we have, in times of <span class="tei tei-q">“over-population,”</span> whole masses
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page239">[pg 239]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg239"></a>

they follow rapidly one on the heels of another, and take opposite
directions. On such occasions, both parties have generally
prostituted themselves for the sake of the favor of the masses;
and the latter have become conscious of the changes which the
force of their arms may effect. In this way, it is impossible
that until order is again entirely established, the reins of power
should not be slackened in many ways at the demands of the
multitude. In this way, too, they are stirred up to the making
of pretentious claims which it is afterwards very difficult to
silence. In every long and far-reaching revolution, whether
undertaken in the interest of the crown, the nobility or the
middle classes, we find, side by side with the seed it intended
to sow, the tares of communism sprout up.

We thus see, that the attempts made by socialism and communism
are, by no means, phenomena unheard of in the past,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page242">[pg 242]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg242"></a>
and peculiar to modern times, as the blind adherents and opponents
of them would have us believe. They are rather diseases
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page243">[pg 243]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg243"></a>
of the body social, which have affected every highly
civilized nation at certain periods of its existence. If the

body be too weak to react healthily and curatively (§
<a class="tei tei-ref pginternal" href="#Section_84">84</a>), the
evil is very apt to lead to the decline of all true freedom and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page245">[pg 245]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg245"></a>
order. The communist, viewing all other things, especially
the organization of the state, only as instruments to supply
his material and absolute wants, considers the liberal either as
a fool who is ever pursuing the phantoms of the brain, or as a
knave who covers his own selfishness under the mask of the
public welfare.<a href="#note_480" id="noteref_480" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">480</span></span></a> Hence the adherents of communism are
satisfied with any form of government which seems to offer
them most, and this a ruthless despotism can do, at least, for the
moment. And, although they are ever ready for any revolution
in the form of government, and easily to be won over to
it, they are most readily captivated by a despotic revolution.
On the other hand, when communism seriously threatens all
that constitutes the wealth of a people, the owners of that
wealth are compelled to fly to any refuge which holds out the
promise to protect them from it, although by seeking that
same refuge they may destroy their own political freedom.<a href="#note_481" id="noteref_481" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">481</span></span></a> The Achean league, which under the leadership of Aratos, the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We now, for the present, turn our gaze from the frightful
revolution, destructive of all civilization, which would necessarily
precede the establishment of a community of goods,<a href="#note_482" id="noteref_482" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">482</span></span></a>
and inquire what would be the consequences. Among angels
(<span class="tei tei-q">“gods and sons of gods”</span> of Plato) and mere animals, a community
of goods might, perhaps, exist without producing injury.
And so, too, it might exist among men bound one to
the other by the bonds of the truest love. The life of every
model family is accompanied by a species of community of
goods.<a href="#note_483" id="noteref_483" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">483</span></span></a>
But in more extensive social organizations, this love
is never found except as an element of the most exalted religious
enthusiasm, which, as a rule, is of very short duration;
of which the Acts of the Apostles (II, 44 ff, 32 ff, V, I, II)
affords us the best known and most beautiful example.<a href="#note_484" id="noteref_484" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">484</span></span></a>

its aggregate frugality only indirectly, and only to the extent

entirely on the division of what the whole community produced.
It would, consequently, and almost always be detrimental
to the whole, and to the other individuals of the
society; whereas, at present, it does so only in exceptional
cases. When Louis Blanc, as Mably had before him, recommended
that the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">point d' honneur</span></span> should
take the place of the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">interêt

and cited the army as an illustration of its workings,
he forgot, among other things, the thirty cases in which the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page249">[pg 249]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg249"></a>
<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">code militaire</span></span>
pronounces sentence of death on the violators of
its provisions. And, as a matter of fact, the Münster Anabaptists
could not help punishing with death every transgression
of their communistic precepts.<a href="#note_487" id="noteref_487" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">487</span></span></a> If, in a community in which
the principles of communism were rigorously carried out, all
the burthens and enjoyments of life were equal, and equally
divided according to the ideas of the crowd, men like Thaer,
Arkwright, and others of their class, who now provide bread
for hundreds of thousands from their studies and laboratories,
would then be able, at most, with a rake and shovel, to provide
food for three or four. The division of labor, with its infinite
amount of productive force, would, for the most part, cease.
Nor would the consequence be that the humbler classes would
be freed from work of a coarse, mechanical, unintellectual and
severe nature; but that the higher classes would be dragged
down to engage in it likewise. And what an increase there
would be in the number of consumers at the same time!
Every man would, with a light heart, follow the most imperious
of human impulses if the whole community were to
educate his children. But we have seen that a community of
goods is desired most urgently in times of over-population.
Hence, here it would make the evil greater yet, by increasing
consumption and diminishing production.

or the centralized superintendence of all production
and consumption, either by the government already existing,
or by one to be created anew. Such a government would be,
of course, a despotism such as the world has scarcely yet seen,
a Cæsaro-Papacy, usurping both the place and power of Father

would be entailed none the less. Every incentive which now
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page252">[pg 252]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg252"></a>
moves man to industry or frugality would disappear, and nothing
remain but universal philanthrophy; or, if you will, but patriotism,
virtues which are not wanting even now. Even guardianship
of the government newly created would be carried on
in a very loose manner; for it would be exercised without any
feeling of personal interest, even in the most favorable case
supposable. It is well known and easily understood, that
state industries are never engaged in, in the long run, with the
same zeal, nor crowned with the same success, as competing
private industries. It is well known, too, how intimate
the connection is between the political freedom of a people and
their economic production; that, for instance, England's greater
wealth, as compared with that of Turkey, depends, most
largely, on the freedom that obtains in the former country
and the servitude that prevails in the latter.<a href="#note_494" id="noteref_494" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">494</span></span></a> And we may inquire
just here, what the result would be, if the despotism of
government should go ten times farther that it has ever gone
in Turkey, when, moreover, the despot who led the state, was
not an individual with his few officials, but the whole crowd,
with its million eyes and million hands. It would, practically,
be to give every producer an escort of a policeman and a revenue
agent, as if he were a prisoner.

since so many communists preach the dissolution and
extinction of all government, and the reign of anarchy? Besides,
there can be no doubt, that the difference of human
talents and human wants, would soon, spite of every law, lead
to a difference in property again. Hence, that first revolution

Experience, however, teaches us, that, in all the lower stages

lesser extent.<a href="#note_497" id="noteref_497" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">497</span></span></a> The institution of private property has been
more fully evolved out of this condition of things, only in proportion
as well-being and culture have been developed as cause
and effect of such well-being. Thus, among most nations of
hunters and fishermen, the idea of private property was unknown
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page254">[pg 254]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg254"></a>
when these nations were first discovered. This is,
indeed, very natural. Their chief spring of production flows
as if of itself, apparently inexhaustible; and the hunter can
hardly think of such a thing as saving any of his booty.<a href="#note_498" id="noteref_498" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">498</span></span></a> And, among nomadic nations, the land is a great meadow held

The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">conquistadores</span></span> of Peru found there something very
like a community of goods, under the despotic guardianship
of the state, viz.: a yearly division of all lands among the
people, in proportion to their rank; the cultivation of these
lands in common, under the superintendence of the state, and
to the sound of music. But, at the stage of civilization that
Peru was then in, land is about the only resource possessed.
The results were the usual ones. A country like Peru, with
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page255">[pg 255]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg255"></a>
only one city, no beasts of burthen, no plows, no trades and
no commerce, cannot possibly be rich.<a href="#note_500" id="noteref_500" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">500</span></span></a> That the constitution
of Lycurgus established a sort of community of goods
among the Spartans, is well known. I need only recall the
public education, the meals in common, the authorization of
stealing,<a href="#note_501" id="noteref_501" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">501</span></span></a> the prohibition of trade, of the precious metals and
fine furniture, the equal division of property and the inalienable
character of the land<a href="#note_502" id="noteref_502" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">502</span></span></a> etc. With such laws, Sparta could
neither be, nor desire to become, wealthy. Of all Greek
states of any historical importance, it preserved longest the
economic peculiarities belonging to a low stage of civilization.
Among most modern nations, the fundamental idea of
their land laws, which had their origin in the middle ages, is,
that each family is only the usufructuary, and that the community
is the sovereign proprietor of the soil. This community
of landed possession finds expression, among other things, in
the vast extent of communal woods and pasturages, in the
varied intersecting of parcels of land one by the other, which,
indeed, change proprietors from time to time, and in the common
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page256">[pg 256]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg256"></a>
working of the land, carried as far as possible etc.<a href="#note_503" id="noteref_503" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">503</span></span></a> In

disposition to disappear, in proportion as national husbandry
or economy has grown more productive.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To this tendency we find, indeed, another, and a no less
powerful one, opposed. Everywhere as civilization advances,
the sphere of action of the state grows larger, and the ends
it serves more numerous.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In its origin, government was established to preserve only
the external security of its subjects. By degrees, it comes to
look after their internal legal security, by enforcing internal
peace, prohibiting revenge for bloodshed etc. It next extends
its care to the well-being, the culture, and even to the comfort
of the people. But the claims of the state must grow in the
same proportion as the service it renders. While Lowe, in
1822, estimated the yearly net income of the British people at
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page257">[pg 257]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg257"></a>
£251,000,000; the government expenses,<a href="#note_506" id="noteref_506" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">506</span></span></a> in 1813 and 1814,
averaged £106,000,000, and these sums were voluntarily devoted
to public purposes by parliament. And so, between
1685 and 1841, the population of England more than trebled
its numbers, But, in the same period of time, the outlay of
the state increased forty fold. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Macaulay</span></span>.) Simultaneously
with this development of things, it becomes more and more
usual by the exercise of the power of eminent domain and
others like it, to sacrifice private rights, acquired by the very
best of titles, to the preponderating common good. We
may allude, further, to the duty, universally imposed in
modern times, of performing military service, to the national
systems of public instruction in so many countries; to the
large number of societies, joint-stock companies, popular holidays;
but particularly to the associations for insurance of
every description. And so it may, indeed, be claimed that we
have come nearer to a community of goods than could have
been dreamed of a hundred years ago.<a href="#note_507" id="noteref_507" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">507</span></span></a> And yet, these are,
for the most part, institutions in which we find reflected the
peculiar strength and solidity of our age. Whoever wishes to
compare the power of one people with that of another, must
take into account not only the elements which constitute their
intellectual and physical force, but especially their inclination
to permit these elements to coöperate for public purposes.<a href="#note_508" id="noteref_508" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">508</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We may now inquire: At what point does this increasing
community cease to be a gain? This is as easily determined
generally, as it is difficult to say what the limit to it is in particular
instances. Progress in the direction of a community
of interests of this nature is beneficial, only so long but certainly
as long as it corresponds with the feeling entertained by
the community, that they have interests in common. Hence it
is, that such a noble kind of communism reigns in art and literature,
one which causes the stronger to willingly labor for the
weaker, and with the greatest success.<a href="#note_509" id="noteref_509" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">509</span></span></a> And so, too, the christian
care of the poor, even were it carried to the height of the
Gospel counsels (Luke, 3:11), would be no direct obstacle in
the way of the development of a nation's public economy, provided
it were given, and accepted, only as christian benevolence.
Every approximation towards a community of goods
should be effected by the love of the rich for the poor, not by
the hatred of the poor for the rich. If all men were true
Christians, a community of goods might exist without danger.
But then, also, the institution of private property would have
no dark side to it. Every employer would give his workmen
the highest wages possible, and demand in return only
the smallest possible sacrifice.<a href="#note_510" id="noteref_510" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">510</span></span></a><a href="#note_511" id="noteref_511" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">511</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The right of inheritance to resources has its origin in a combination
of the idea of the family with the idea of property.
And, indeed, this combination of ideas is a very natural one.
The larger portion of mankind consider the pleasures of the
family as the highest attainable, and endeavor, whenever their
economic means make it at all possible, to secure them. At
the same time, the selfishness of most men is not confined to
their own persons, but extends also to their posterity. Hence
it is that bed and board, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">eonnubium</span></span> and
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">commercium</span></span>, have,

in practice, the greater number of nations of hunters, who,

or to deprive minor children of their inheritance.<a href="#note_514" id="noteref_514" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">514</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The certainty, that the material welfare of their children depends,
in great part, on their industry and frugality, is one of
the most powerful incentives to good, in the case of most
men. And this is the basis of the economic utility of the family
right of inheritance.<a href="#note_515" id="noteref_515" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">515</span></span></a> There is scarcely any other institution
which opposes over-population with such efficiency, for
the reason, that the obstacle placed in its way here is placed
very directly, at the point where it can make itself felt most,
viz.: in the life of the family itself. The weaker the family feeling,
the less does the abolition of the right of inheritance interfere
with the economic interests of a nation. Hence, for instance,
it is, that taxes imposed upon legacies, bequests, testamentary
gifts etc., are less objectionable in proportion as they
affect only those in the more remote degrees of relationship
in which inheritance is something merely accidental. While,
when a nation is yet in the intermediate stages of civilization,
the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">family</span></em> right of inheritance seems to be very strong,
especially as regards landed property, a consequence of the
fact, that a superior kind of title to such property is recognized
to exist in the family; at a period, when individualism
becomes more developed, the liberty of devise by will is wont
to prevail more and more.<a href="#note_516" id="noteref_516" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">516</span></span></a>
Then the right of inheritance becomes,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page261">[pg 261]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg261"></a>
so to speak, a more elevated species of personal property,
a prolongation of the same beyond the grave. Should
testamentary freedom be too much hampered, selfishness would
manifest itself in a way much more detrimental to economic
interests, viz.: in the consumption of wealth, during the lifetime
of its owner. Every man would be but a life annuitant
of his own property.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But, at the same time, in periods of moral decline, complete
freedom may degenerate so as to produce evils equally great.
The wealthy Bœotians, in the later days of Hellenic history,
were wont to form themselves into dissolute drinking companies;
and not only the childless, but even fathers of families
made over their property to these companies, limiting their
offspring to a portion which it was made their duty to let them
have. It was so in Rome, also, in Cicero's time, when every
acquaintance of standing took it very ill if not remembered in
the will of the testator, and where Octavian, for instance, in
the last twenty years of his reign, received about 70,000,000
thalers through legacies left him by his <span class="tei tei-q">“friends.”</span><a href="#note_517" id="noteref_517" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">517</span></span></a> Here,

that land may be used productively, and, in most instances,
this employment of capital and labor is of long duration, irrevocable
in the very nature of things, and one the fruits of
which can be reaped only after some time has elapsed. Now,
this cooperation of capital and labor is such, that no one would
undertake to employ them in the cultivation of the land, had
he not the strongest assurance of possessing it. Hence, agriculture
in its most rudimentary stage supposes ownership of
the land, at least from the time that it is <span class="tei tei-q">“tickled with the
hoe,”</span> until it <span class="tei tei-q">“smiles with the harvest;”</span> or, to express it more
accurately, all the time intervening between the work of the
plow and the labor of the sickle. The more, afterwards, population
and civilization increase, the more products must be
wrung from the soil. But this can be accomplished only by
means of its more <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intensive</span></em> cultivation (higher farming), by
lavishing a greater amount of capital and labor on it, and, as
a rule, by extending the circle of agricultural operations by
means of combinations more and more artificial. Hence, the
progress of civilization demands an ever increasing fixity, and
a more pronounced shaping of landed property (the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">specification</span></span>
of jurists), in the interests of all who share in this progress,
and even of those who own no landed property themselves.
Were there no property in land, every one would find it more
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page264">[pg 264]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg264"></a>
difficult and laborious to gratify his want of agricultural
products;<a href="#note_521" id="noteref_521" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">521</span></span></a>
and the products themselves would be of an inferior
kind.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus, for instance, in Camargo, the lackmus was formerly
prepared from plants to be had <span class="tei tei-q">“free”</span> in the woods. It was
then, however, much dearer than it is now that the plants are
artificially raised on landed property.<a href="#note_522" id="noteref_522" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">522</span></span></a>
It is otherwise with
the fisheries. The appropriation of rivers or seas would not
tend to increase the abundance of their products, and hence
this appropriation is, on the whole, rare.<a href="#note_523" id="noteref_523" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">523</span></span></a>

Whenever this admixture of capital and labor with land has
taken place to no great extent, private property in land is not
found developed in any degree. Thus, there are even now
many half-civilized countries in which the land is forfeited because
not tilled for many years, and where it may be occupied
by the first person who will cultivate it.<a href="#note_524" id="noteref_524" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">524</span></span></a>
In Europe, common
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page265">[pg 265]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg265"></a>
possession of forests and pasture lands asserted itself much
longer than that of arable land, because, in the case of the
former, labor and capital play a much less important part in
the management of them. And yet, even in the case of arable
land etc., and, in the highest stages of civilization, the property-quality
is yet less developed than the property-quality of
capital. How seldom do we find <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">fidei commissa</span></span> of capital,
or capital juridically tied up. We find that the law of all
ancient nations drew a marked distinction between moveable
and immoveable property, and that the power of disposing of
the former by sale, pledge, in dowry, partition etc., was a much
freer one. And even now, the police power which may be
exercised over moveable property is much more restricted
than that over houses and land.<a href="#note_525" id="noteref_525" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">525</span></span></a>
The justice of the exclusive
right of possession to what one has earned and saved is obvious
to every one. On the other hand, the appropriation of
<span class="tei tei-q">“original and indestructible natural forces”</span> has its basis not
so much in justice as in the general good; and the state has
always considered itself entitled to attach to the <span class="tei tei-q">“monopoly
of land,”</span> which it accorded to the first possessor, all kinds of
limitations and conditions in the interest of the common good,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page266">[pg 266]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg266"></a>
and sometimes to consider private property in land in the light
of a semi-public function.<a href="#note_526" id="noteref_526" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">526</span></span></a> I may instance the feudal principles
of the latter portion of the middle ages, which are so far
removed from our ideas of private property in land; and yet,
of which many echoes are heard, even in our day, and are not
without their influence in practice. Thus, further, for instance,
even in England, the greater number of the poor-rates, of
taxes for the support of the established church, the maintenance
of public highways etc., are heaped upon the rent of
land. Many socialists have proposed to make the state the
sole proprietor of the soil,<a href="#note_527" id="noteref_527" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">527</span></span></a>
sometimes adding the condition,
that the previous private owners should be compensated in
capital, when it would be at least supposable that private capital
might be enticed to cultivate it, if long and sure leases of
it were made. This would be a <span class="tei tei-q">“good”</span> demesne-husbandry,
extending over the entire country. We need only glance at
those kingdoms in which something analogous is to be found,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page267">[pg 267]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg267"></a>

Credit<a href="#note_530" id="noteref_530" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">530</span></span></a> is the power of disposition over the goods of
another,<a href="#note_531" id="noteref_531" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">531</span></span></a>
voluntarily granted in consideration of the mere promise
of the counter-value.<a href="#note_532" id="noteref_532" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">532</span></span></a> As Franklin says: A good pay
is master of another man's purse. Hence, it is evident that
whoever would obtain credit must be believed to possess the
ability as well as the intention to fulfill his promise. Where
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page269">[pg 269]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg269"></a>
this belief is based simply on the opinion entertained of the
person of the debtor, we speak of personal credit,<a href="#note_533" id="noteref_533" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">533</span></span></a> in contradistinction
especially to the credit based on bailment, pledge,
hypothecation etc. The longer the time between the making
of the promise and the period fixed for its fulfillment, the less
certain is the latter, where the security is simply the person
of the debtor. It is chiefly in very uncivilized nations and
also in nations in their decrepitude, and during periods of anarchy,
and in despotisms, that personal security stands higher
than any other. The same is true, though for other reasons,
in very energetic civilized nations, where the people put a high
estimate on the element of labor in their economy, among
whose members legal security is, indeed, found, but where the
peculiar sensitiveness of speculation would be too much hampered
by the more sluggish nature of other credits; as, for
instance, in North America, and even in ancient Rome. Civilized
nations that have reached the stationary economic state,
on this account much prefer the greater security and the absence
of care which accompany non-personal credit.<a href="#note_534" id="noteref_534" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">534</span></span></a>
In estimating
the ability of the debtor to meet his promise, we must
take into account, especially, the disposable character of his
resources; otherwise it would be impossible to understand
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page270">[pg 270]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg270"></a>
why the merchant may so frequently obtain a loan on his
stock equal to its whole value, while the owner of land can
place it as security only to the extent of half its value.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Credit, on the whole, grows in importance with an advance
in civilization, and this is true especially of credit intended for
productive purposes. This is a consequence of the greater
division of labor which causes unfinished products to be put on
the market more and more frequently,—products which come
to have a value only after some time, but which, when that time
has elapsed, have present value. And, indeed, as the world
advances and civilization grows, it becomes much easier to
forecast the future with certainty. The future, also, then becomes
more a source of solicitude, and fixed capital, as a consequence,
plays a part which grows daily more important.
The limit to the development of credit is this: it is safe only
when the debtor invests his borrowed goods in the production
of, to say the least, their equivalent. This is why the personality
of the state, clothed with immortality and with a formally
boundless power of taxation, is so often seduced into engaging
in transactions of credit which are never self-discharged.<a href="#note_535" id="noteref_535" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">535</span></span></a>
The social diseases of panics and of extravagant enterprises
stand in the same relation to credit that unbelief and superstition
do to true religion.<a href="#note_536" id="noteref_536" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">536</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As regards the effects of credit, we may remark, that it is as
powerless directly to produce new capital as is the division
of labor to produce new workmen. To every credit of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page271">[pg 271]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg271"></a>
creditor corresponds a debit of the debtor. As Turgot said:
<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">Tout credit est un
emprunt</span></span>.<a href="#note_537" id="noteref_537" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">537</span></span></a><a href="#note_538" id="noteref_538" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">538</span></span></a><a href="#note_539" id="noteref_539" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">539</span></span></a> But, on the other hand, credit
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page272">[pg 272]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg272"></a>
facilitates the transmission of the elements of production,
especially of capital, from one hand to another.<a href="#note_540" id="noteref_540" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">540</span></span></a> When,
therefore, the debtor employs the capital that he has borrowed,
more productively than the creditor would have done, the whole
country is a gainer; as it is a loser, on the contrary, when a
person engaged in industry advances to the idler, the frugal
man to the spendthrift, the solid man to the wild speculator.
In declining nations, where every new development hastens
decay, the latter alternative may be the prevailing one; and,
especially here, may the usurious giving of credit by the shrewd
to the simple lead to ruinous debtor-slavery. Among a vigorous
and energetic people, the former is apt to govern, as it
is only by the productive employment of the loans made that
they are permanently enabled to pay interest. Here credit is
an invaluable means, not only of putting idle capital in motion,
and of making active capital still more active, but especially of
concentrating capital, by which it may gain as much in productive
power as labor does by the coöperation of labor. This is
effected, very frequently, by means of joint-stock companies,
the principle of which recommends them especially in enterprises
where stationary capital is required rather than circulating
capital, and where capital generally plays a greater
part than labor; and where this labor can be subjected to provisions
which may be accurately laid down beforehand; as,
for instance, in the case of docks, insurance companies, banks,<a href="#note_541" id="noteref_541" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">541</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page273">[pg 273]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg273"></a>
etc. Banks, then, become real reservoirs of capital, provided
they are properly and judiciously established and managed;
real reservoirs which receive in one place the capital which is
superfluous elsewhere, in order to supply some other place
with that which is necessary to it. The more confidence increases,
the more are even the smallest driblets of capital
awakened from their slumbers, and made active and productive.
It is only by means of credit that the help of foreign
capital can be obtained for home production. Indeed, credit,
considered as an exchange of probable future goods against
actually existing goods, is one of the principal functions of
the temporal solidarity of the economy of nations. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Schäffle</span></span>.)
Without credit, there would be very little place for speculation
proper.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We may see how the possibility of giving and receiving credit
promotes wealth, by contemplating the poorer classes, whose
poverty, both as cause and effect, is very closely related to the
absence of credit. And here we have a suggestion of the reverse
to the bright side of the picture of credit, analogous to
that mentioned in § <a class="tei tei-ref pginternal" href="#Section_62">62</a> of the coöperation of labor,
viz.: that it tends to intensify inequality among men. The man who
is distinguished by the amount of his wealth, or by his position
is naturally known to a much wider circle than others
are. From which it follows, that he may, by the way of credit,
increase his power, already so much greater in the economic
world, by a much larger multiplier.<a href="#note_542" id="noteref_542" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">542</span></span></a> Hence, it need not
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page274">[pg 274]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg274"></a>
surprise us, that the great obtain credit from those in a lower
position, at least as frequently as they give them credit in turn.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On the side of the creditor, the possibility of making loans
is a powerful incentive to frugality. Were there no credit,
those who were not in a condition to employ their capital productively
would make savings only within very narrow
limits.<a href="#note_543" id="noteref_543" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">543</span></span></a>

Private credit is always conditioned, and in a great many
ways, by the situation of the whole nation's business; in other
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page275">[pg 275]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg275"></a>
words, by their politico-economical situation. It is especially
in the higher stages of civilization, that one bankrupt may
easily drag numberless others down with him; and where the
laws are bad or powerless, not even the wealthiest man can
predicate his own solvency for any length of time in advance.
One of the most important conditions of credit is the certainty
that, if the debtor's good will to meet his obligations should
fail, it shall be supplied by the compulsory process of the
courts. Hence, the importance of a judicial procedure, at
once impartial, enlightened, prompt and cheap.<a href="#note_544" id="noteref_544" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">544</span></span></a> The more
vigorous the laws relating to debt are in preventing dishonesty
on the part of the debtor, the more advantageous are they to
honorable and honest debtors. Adam Smith has rightly said,
that in countries in which creditors are not completely protected
by the courts, the honorable man who borrows money
is in the same condition as the notoriously dishonest man or the
spendthrift, in better governed countries. He finds it more difficult
to borrow and is obliged to pay a higher rate of interest.<a href="#note_545" id="noteref_545" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">545</span></span></a>
Rigorous debtor laws, on the other hand, diminish in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page276">[pg 276]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg276"></a>
the whole nation the amount of <span class="tei tei-q">“bad debts,”</span> that is, a not insignificant
portion of the cost of production. They, at the
same time, promote, as far as it is in the power of laws to do
it, national honor and the mutual confidence of man in man.
The excellence of their debtor laws, in their most flourishing

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the history of laws relating to credit, we may distinguish,
in a great many countries, three stages of development.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A. The laws, in the first stage, are very severe. In the
Germanic middle age the insolvent was disgraced. He became
the slave of his creditor (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">zu Hand und
Halfter</span></span>), who might imprison him, fetter him (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">stöcken und blöcken</span></span>), and
probably kill him. A Norwegian law allowed the creditor,
when his debtor would not work and his friends would not
ransom him, to take him before the court, and <span class="tei tei-q">“to lop off from his body what
part he will, above or below.”</span><a href="#note_547" id="noteref_547" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">547</span></span></a> To judge of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page277">[pg 277]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg277"></a>
these provisions correctly, it is necessary to bear in mind the
many ways in which family resources were at this time bound
and tied up, and not forget <span class="tei tei-q">“the power of defiance in these
iron natures.”</span><a href="#note_548" id="noteref_548" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">548</span></span></a> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Niebuhr</span></span>.)
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
B. The canon law introduced milder principles. Gregory
the Great had already prohibited the holding on to the body
of the debtor.<a href="#note_549" id="noteref_549" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">549</span></span></a> On this account, during the latter portion of
the middle ages, it was customary to stipulate by contract that
the provisions of the ancient law should govern in this matter,
to submit to imprisonment etc.<a href="#note_550" id="noteref_550" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">550</span></span></a> The influence of the Roman
law made it gradually more usual, in the case of insolvent
debtors, to demand no more from them than the assignment
of their property for the benefit of their creditors. This, however,
led to numerous frauds; and these became more frequent
in proportion as the laws governing the property of parties
while the marriage relation existed between them, and as executions
against landed property etc. were defective.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
C. Hence, in more highly civilized times, there has been a
return to the severity of earlier ages. Persons engaged in
commerce, especially those whose capital is so volatile, and to
whom time is a thing so precious, can scarcely dispense willingly
with personal imprisonment for debt. Hence, legislation
on bills of exchange, sanctioned especially by imprisonment

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One of the most efficient means of promoting credit consists
in legislation intended to dry up the source of bad debts,
by placing obstacles in the way of reckless or usurious credits
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page280">[pg 280]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg280"></a>
for objects of luxury or pleasure, to bad customers.<a href="#note_556" id="noteref_556" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">556</span></span></a> But the
application of these laws should be clear and simple as to
their matter, and require no inquiries, relating to the person,
impracticable for a business man to make.<a href="#note_557" id="noteref_557" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">557</span></span></a> Thus, for instance,
a short period of limitation established by statute in
the matter of advances made for ordinary money-claims is
a beneficial restraint, as well on the creditor as on the debtor,
since it prevents the accumulation of a multitude of small
debts which almost imperceptibly but at the same time irresistibly
overpower the debtor under their weight.<a href="#note_558" id="noteref_558" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">558</span></span></a> Another
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page281">[pg 281]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg281"></a>
efficient means is associations of business men to circulate lists
of bad debtors, and to prosecute their own demands in common.<a href="#note_559" id="noteref_559" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">559</span></span></a>
On the other hand, experience has shown that imprisonment
for debt, as a means of enforcing a creditor's claim,
where the amount of the debt is very small and such as only
very poor debtors are apt to incur, is of little service. It is
even injurious, because a great many sellers would rely on
that means of compelling payment in the future instead of demanding
it immediately, as they should do in the interest both
of themselves and of their customers. As a rule, it is only
rich creditors who can resort to it with success, a class who
compel payment through this means by wringing it from the
debtor's relations more frequently than from the debtor himself.
The working out of debts in correctional institutions
seems, for the same reasons, to fail of its object, since even
well governed institutions scarcely cover their current expenses from the
income derived from this source.<a href="#note_560" id="noteref_560" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">560</span></span></a> The
inequitable character of imprisonment for debt lies in this, that
it punishes the unfortunate debtor as severely as it does the
malicious one. It must be clearly distinguished from the imprisonment
recognized by the courts as a punishment for reckless
or fraudulent bankruptcy.<a href="#note_561" id="noteref_561" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">561</span></span></a> We must pass a judgment
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page282">[pg 282]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg282"></a>
similar to that on the imprisonment of the person of the debtor
on the seizure of his wages not yet due, so far, at least, as an
amount absolutely necessary to save himself and family from
want, is not excepted. The prohibition of such seizure, beyond
this, would amount to a declaration that all workmen
without capital, even the best, should be considered unworthy
of credit.<a href="#note_562" id="noteref_562" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">562</span></span></a> We may also include in this category
such laws as except from execution the necessary tools of a
tradesman, since to deprive him of them would be to prevent

They were intended to protect not only the debtor, but also the aggregate of creditors
against the short-sighted severity of one of their number. They were
wont to be given especially when the debtor showed that immediate
execution would not only have the effect of ruining
himself, but of sending his creditors away empty handed;
while, if time were given him, he would be able to satisfy
every one.<a href="#note_564" id="noteref_564" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">564</span></span></a>

as a species of cabinet-justice. Nor should the granting of
them be compared with the pardoning power. In the case of
a pardon, the offended State forgives. In this case it sacrifices
the unquestionable right of one party to the very doubtful advantage
of another. Where such letters are granted in great numbers, credit cannot
fail to suffer. <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">Quinquinnellen gehören

Yet in troublous times, when a great many debtors are insolvent
at the same time, the question of modifying the laws
relating to debt, temporarily, has been mooted. It has been
urged on such occasions, that it would be a matter of enormous
difficulty to treat, <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">lege artis</span></span>,
thousands as bankrupts at once; that thousands
of businesses would have to be closed, their
stocks cast upon the market at mock prices, and their employees
thrown out of employment. But, if certain privileges
were to be accorded to all who should declare themselves unable
to meet their obligations before a certain day, it would
be known, at least, that the others were in a solid condition;
and this would have the effect to strengthen the credit which
had been before universally shaken. We must, however,
leaving all cases of abuse out of the question, remember, that
a really unrightful favor, granted to the debtor, may possibly
entail the ruin of his creditor. Besides, the uncertainty of
the law would have a much worse effect on credit than uncertainty
as to the personal status of individuals.<a href="#note_566" id="noteref_566" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">566</span></span></a> Where, as is
the case generally in inferior stages of civilization, debtors and
creditors form two distinct classes, the question of right is not,
indeed, changed, but there is a solid basis afforded for the
political admeasurement of opposing interests. In another

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The more highly developed the division of labor is, the
more frequent and necessary do exchanges become. While
the hermit engaged in production thinks only of his own wants,
and the mere housekeeper of the wants of his household, the
man who is part of a nation and who plays a part in its general
economy, must bear in mind the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">MARKET</span></span> in which goods
of one kind are exchanged against goods of other kinds. The
greater, more various and more changeable the conditions of
this market are, the greater are the intellectual faculties demanded
to engage in it successfully, and to the advantage of
everybody concerned in it.<a href="#note_569" id="noteref_569" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">569</span></span></a> Goods intended to be exchanged
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page290">[pg 290]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg290"></a>
are called commodities. By the circulation of commodities is
meant their going over from one owner to another.<a href="#note_570" id="noteref_570" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">570</span></span></a> Among
the principal causes of circulation, we may mention the difference
in the nature and civilization of countries and peoples,
the distinction between city and country, the division of people
into classes etc.<a href="#note_571" id="noteref_571" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">571</span></span></a> The rapidity of circulation depends, on the
one hand, on the quantity of commodities, and on the other, on
the degree to which the division of labor has been carried. In
both respects it is, therefore, an important indication of the
wealth of the nation, and of the world.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Different commodities have very different degrees of capacity for circulation
(<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">Circulationsfähigkeit</span></span>),
that is, of certainty of finding purchasers, and of facility of seeking purchasers.
The smaller, compared with its value, the volume and weight
of a commodity are; the longer and more conveniently it can
be stored away; the more invariable and well-known are its
value in use and value in exchange: the more readily does it
go from one place to another, the more easily is it transmitted
from one period of time to another and from the possession of
one person into the possession of another. Thus, for instance,
the precious metals circulate more rapidly than industrial products;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page291">[pg 291]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg291"></a>
these in turn more than raw material,<a href="#note_572" id="noteref_572" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">572</span></span></a> and
immovable property circulates least rapidly of all. An improvement in the
means of transportation naturally increases the capacity of circulation
of the entire wealth of a people, and especially of those
commodities which were not before transferable as well as
of those of which the cost of transportation constituted a peculiarly
large component part of the price.<a href="#note_573" id="noteref_573" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">573</span></span></a> The greater the
capacity for circulation of any kind of goods, the greater is
the power of control of its owner in the world of trade. If
we compare two men, each of whom possesses a million of dollars,
but one of whom has that million in money and the other
in land, we shall find that the former is able, for present purposes,
such as loaning to the state in case of need, aiding a
conspiracy etc., to command resources much more readily and
effectively than the latter. Under the ordinary circumstances
of a nation's economy, we find that the owner of money is
very seldom in want of bread, fuel or clothing, whereas very
many owners of other property may be in want of money.<a href="#note_574" id="noteref_574" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">574</span></span></a>
True, resources which may, so to speak, take the offensive
most energetically, offer less resistance to unforeseen misfortune.
The possessor of such resources is in a condition to lose
his all on the turn of a single die. As civilization advances,
the circulating capacity of a nation's wealth increases.<a href="#note_575" id="noteref_575" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">575</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
With an advance in a people's public economy, we find an
increased rapidity of circulation connected, both as cause and
effect. Every improvement, every thing which shortens the
process of production, must facilitate and accelerate the circulation
of commodities. And so, the perfecting of the means
of transport of commodities, of the media of exchange and of
credit, an increase in the number of middlemen who make it
their business to purchase in order to sell again. On the other
hand, the more rapid the circulation of wealth, the more can
it promote production. The more rapidly, for instance, the
manufacturer of cloth exchanges his wares for money, the
more rapidly may he employ the money in the purchase of
new tools and the hiring of new labor; and the sooner may he
appear in the market with new cloth. It is here precisely as
it is in agriculture, which is more productive where the seed returns
several times in a year (several crops<a href="#note_576" id="noteref_576" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">576</span></span></a>) to the hand of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page293">[pg 293]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg293"></a>
the peasant than it is where this happens only once. The
nearer the members of the commercial organism are to one
another, the more rapid is circulation wont to be. Hence, it
is more rapid in industry than in agriculture; in retail trade
than in wholesale; in large cities than in the country; among a
dense population than among a sparse population.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">regularity</span></em> of circulation increases with economic culture.
Its concentration at large terminal points, its interruption
by bad seasons of the year, belong to the lower stages of
the political economy of a people; although bad harvests,
floods, wars, revolutions etc. may, at any time, lead to a sluggishness
or to an arrest of circulation.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But it is especially the freedom of circulation that increases
with an advance in civilization, and this advance, like the two
preceding, first affects the home or inland circulation. Freedom
of competition, the freedom of commerce and industry,
technical expressions used to designate freedom in general in
the domain of a nation's economy, is the natural conclusion
drawn from the principles of individual independence and of
private property. Hence its development is as slow as the
development of these, and attains its full growth only in highly
cultivated nations, their colonies and dependencies. In very
low stages of economic development, the circulation of goods
is hampered by the absence of legal security; later, by privileges
accorded to a great number of families, corporate
bodies, municipalities, classes, etc., and later yet by the mighty
guardianship which the state exercises by its power of legislation
and even of education.<a href="#note_577" id="noteref_577" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">577</span></span></a>
Each one of these epochs constitutes
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page294">[pg 294]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg294"></a>
the end of the preceding one, and is milder than it was.
Finally comes the period of complete freedom, when every
man is permitted to manage his own affairs even with injury
to himself, provided the injury is confined to himself.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The later times of the Roman Empire are the best illustration
of how, with the decline of the conditions which must precede
freedom of competition, that freedom itself decays.<a href="#note_578" id="noteref_578" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">578</span></span></a>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Freedom of competition unchains all economic forces, good
and bad. Hence, when the former preponderate, it hastens
the time of a people's grandeur, as it does their decline where the
latter gain the upper hand.<a href="#note_579" id="noteref_579" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">579</span></span></a> We may say of economic freedom
what may be said of all other freedom, that the removal of
external constraint can be justified and produces the greater
good of the greater number only where a stern empire over self
takes its place. Without this it would not prevent or avoid idleness,
usury or over-population. Freedom must not be simply
negative. It must be positive. If on account of the immaturity
or over-maturity of a people, there be no sturdy middle
class among them, unlimited competition may become what Bazard
calls a general <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">sauve-qui-peut</span></span>
(let the devil take the hindmost); what Fourier designates as a
<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">morcellement industriel</span></span>,
and a <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">fraude commerciale</span></span>;
what M. Chevalier denominated <span class="tei tei-q">“a battle-field on which the little are devoured by the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page295">[pg 295]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg295"></a>
big;”</span> and in such case, as Bodz-Reymond says, the word
competition, meaning simply that each one is permitted to run
in whatever direction he may see a door open to him, is but
another and a new expression for vagabondizing. But here
the evil does not lie in too great competition, but in this, that
on one side there is too little competition.<a href="#note_580" id="noteref_580" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">580</span></span></a> The opposing principle
of competition is always monopoly, that is, as John Stuart
Mill says, the taxation of industry in the interest of indolence
and even rapacity; and protection against competition is
synonymous with a dispensation from the necessity to be as
industrious and clever as other people.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A protection of this nature, sufficiently effective to attain its
end, would not fail to arrest the efforts of those who had accomplished
something, and even to turn them backward.
That freedom of competition is a species of declaration of war,<a href="#note_581" id="noteref_581" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">581</span></span></a>
among men considered as producers, is certain; but, at the

adapted to satisfy wants, production is, the more readily
does any product find a remunerative market; more readily in
England, for instance, in spite, or rather, because of, the great
competition there, than in Greenland or Madagascar. From
this it follows that, as a rule, a person is in a better condition
to purchase more goods in proportion as he has produced
more himself. According to official accounts, the average
value of a harvest of wheat and potatoes in Prussia was formerly
332,500,000 thalers. In the year 1850, however, it was
only 262,000,000 thalers. As a matter of course, the country
people in that year could not purchase from the cities as much
as in ordinary years, by a difference of 70,000,000 thalers.
This illustrates how every class of people, who live by finding
a free market for their products, are interested in the prosperity
of all other classes. As Bastiat says: <span class="tei tei-q">“All legitimate interests
are harmonious.”</span> The more flourishing a city, the
better off are the towns around it, which furnish it with provisions;
and the richer these towns, the more flourishing is
the industry of the city which ministers to their wants.<a href="#note_589" id="noteref_589" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">589</span></span></a> It is
important that this fact should be borne steadily in mind,
especially in times of advanced civilization, when the feeling
that we all have interests in common, is too apt to grow dormant.
Nothing can better serve to awaken it again when it
has become so. A nation, says Louis Blanc, in which one portion
of the people is oppressed by another, is like a man

As all commerce is based on the mutual dependence of the
contracting parties, we need not be surprised to find international
commerce so dependent. But this dependence need
not, by any means, be equally great on both sides. Rather
is the individual or the nation which stands in most urgent
need of foreign goods or products the most dependent. Hence,
it seems that, in the commercial intercourse between an agricultural
and an industrial people, in which the former furnish
food and the raw material of manufactures, and the latter
manufactured articles, the latter are the more dependent. In
case of war, for instance, it is much easier to dispense for a
long time with manufactured articles than with most articles
of food.<a href="#note_595" id="noteref_595" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">595</span></span></a> However, this condition of things is very much
modified, for the better, by all those circumstances on which
the dominant active commerce of a nation depends. It is, for
instance, much easier for the English, on account of their
greater familiarity with, and knowledge of the laws and nature
of commerce, on account of their business connections, their
capital, credit and means of transportation, but more particularly
on account of the greater capacity of circulation of their
national resources, to find a new market in the stead of one
that has been closed to them, than it is for the Russians with
their much more immoveable system of public economy.<a href="#note_596" id="noteref_596" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">596</span></span></a> It

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The price of a commodity is its value in exchange expressed
in the quantum of some other definite commodity, against which
it is exchanged or to be exchanged. Hence, it is possible for
any commodity to have as many different prices as there are
other kinds of commodities with which it may be compared.<a href="#note_597" id="noteref_597" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">597</span></span></a>
But whenever price is spoken of, we think only of a comparison
of the commodity whose value is to be estimated, with the
commodity which, at that time and place, is most current and
has the greatest capacity for circulation. (Money.)<a href="#note_598" id="noteref_598" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">598</span></span></a> When
two commodities have changed their price-relation to each
other, it is not possible, from the simple fact of such change
of relation, to determine on which side the change has taken
place. If we find that a commodity A stands to all other
commodities, C, D, E etc., in the same relation as to price as
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page304">[pg 304]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg304"></a>
before, while commodity B, compared with the same, has
changed its place in the scale of prices, we may infer that
B, and not A, has left its former position.<a href="#note_599" id="noteref_599" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">599</span></span></a>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The words costly and dear, as contradistinguished from
common and cheap, both indicate a high price. We, however,
call a commodity costly whose price, compared with
that of other similar commodities, is high. On the other
hand, we call a commodity dear when we compare it with
itself, and with its own average price in other places and at
other times.<a href="#note_600" id="noteref_600" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">600</span></span></a>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In individual cases, the price of a commodity is determined
most usually, and at the same time most superficially, by custom;
people ask and pay for a commodity what others have
asked and paid for it. If we go deeper and inquire what
originated this customary price and may continually change
it, we come to the struggle of interests between buyers and
sellers. And if science would analyze the ultimate elements
of the incentives to this struggle and the forces engaged in it,
it is necessary that it should keep in view the entire economy
of the nation, and even all national life.

Price.</span></h3>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
No where in the public economy of a people are the workings
of self-interest so apparent as in the determination of
prices. When the price of a commodity is once fixed by the
conflict of opposing interests,<a href="#note_601" id="noteref_601" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">601</span></span></a>
the self-seeking of every individual
dictates that he should thereby gain as much as possible
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page305">[pg 305]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg305"></a>
of the goods of others, and lose as little as possible of his own.
In this struggle, the victory is generally to the stronger, and
the price is higher or lower, according to the superiority of
the buyer or seller.<a href="#note_602" id="noteref_602" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">602</span></span></a>
But who, in such case, is the stronger?
Political or physical superiority can turn the balance one way
or another only in very barbarous times, and especially in
times when legal security is small.<a href="#note_603" id="noteref_603" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">603</span></span></a> As a rule, it is the party
in whom the desire of holding on to his own commodities is
strongest, and who is least moved by the want of the wares
of others. As in every conflict, confidence in self, sometimes
even unbounded confidence in self, is an important element of
success. A party to a contract of sale or barter, who considers
his immediate position decidedly stronger than that of
the other party, will scarcely depart from his demands. Hence
it is, that in exchange, one party so frequently holds back
until the other has expressed his terms.<a href="#note_604" id="noteref_604" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">604</span></span></a> How different is the

is compelled to pay and the prices it would get for them,
from the adjoining owners, in case of the dissolution of the
company.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the struggle to raise prices or to lower them, which is
always going on, undergoes modifications of every description
among all really commercial nations, partly through the influence
of the public conscience, which brands as inhuman
and blameworthy the spoilation of the opposing party by acts
which the laws do not reach. And this consideration by the
public conscience is all the more severe in proportion as real
competition in the article sold is wanting.<a href="#note_605" id="noteref_605" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">605</span></span></a> But the chief modification
in this struggle is produced by the fact, that where
civilization has advanced farthest, every commodity is offered
for sale by a great many and wanted by a great many.<a href="#note_606" id="noteref_606" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">606</span></span></a> As
soon as several seek the same object, there naturally results a
rivalry among them, which induces each to attain the desired
end, even by the making of greater sacrifices than others.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page307">[pg 307]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg307"></a>
The greater the supply of a commodity is, as compared with
the demand for it, the lower is its price; the greater the demand
as compared with the supply, the higher it is. And,
indeed, there is question here, not only of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mass</span></em> of things
supplied or demanded, but also of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intensity</span></em> of the supply
and demand.<a href="#note_607" id="noteref_607" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">607</span></span></a>

If the exchange-force of both contractants be equal, or, in
other words, if both, with equal knowledge, are interested in
the completion of the exchange, there results from this attitude
of the parties toward each other, what is called an equitable,
or average price, in which both meet with their deserts.
Here each is a gainer, since each has parted with the commodity
which was less necessary to him, and received in
exchange the commodity which was more necessary to him.
Looked at, however, from the stand-point, not simply of a
nation's but of the world's economy, the value given and the
value received are equal.<a href="#note_608" id="noteref_608" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">608</span></span></a><a href="#note_609" id="noteref_609" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">609</span></span></a>

The purchaser in his demand is wont to consider principally
the value in use of a commodity, according as it, in a higher
or lower degree, ministers to a necessary want, to a decency
or to a luxury. The difference of opinion as to which of
these categories any given want belongs depends not only on
the nature of the country and the customs of its people, but,

When the supply of articles of luxury diminishes, the price
of them, it is true, rises. But as now there is a number of
purchasers no longer able to pay for them, the demand for
them also decreases, and their price, as a consequence, rises in
a less degree than might be inferred from the amount and condition
of the supply merely. And so, on the other hand, an
increase of the supply which lowers the price is wont, in the
case of pleasures capable of a wide extension, such as are ministered
to by fine roots, vegetables, etc., to produce an increase
of the demand, and this operates to arrest the falling price.

instance, wheat. When there is a want of such an article, men
prefer to dispense with all other articles, to some extent, rather
than to practice frugality in bread; and all the more, as bread
is not so much used as consumed rapidly, while clothes and
metallic articles last a long time. And even after an over-abundant
harvest, leaving voluntary waste out of the question,
consumption is increased by a finer separating of the flour, an
increase in the amount of corn fed to cattle, and the distillation
of spirits. Hence, demand and supply by no means run in
parallel lines at every moment; and indispensable articles tend
to greater perturbations in price than those which can be dispensed
with.<a href="#note_617" id="noteref_617" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">617</span></span></a><a href="#note_618" id="noteref_618" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">618</span></span></a>
The price of grain, especially, varies in a ratio
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page312">[pg 312]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg312"></a>
very different from the inverse ratio of the amount of the
harvest;<a href="#note_619" id="noteref_619" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">619</span></span></a> although a formula therefor expressed in figures,

Farmers must everywhere and always withhold a certain
amount of their harvest for seed, for home use etc., from the
market. Only absolute necessity can induce them to draw on
the quantity thus laid by. But the ratio of this part to the
whole is very different in different countries.<a href="#note_621" id="noteref_621" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">621</span></span></a> In the higher
stages of civilization, where payment in money has taken the
place of payment in produce, and all other kinds of payment,
and where the cultivator of the ground pays the wages of his
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page313">[pg 313]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg313"></a>
laborers almost exclusively in money, so that they, like all
others, purchase what bread they require in the market; a
given deficit in the harvest must be spread over a much larger
market supply; and prices, therefore, remain much less affected
than in the lower stages of civilization.<a href="#note_622" id="noteref_622" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">622</span></span></a> And so, it is clear
that a like bad harvest must affect prices very differently, if
there be a large importation or exportation of the means of
subsistence, and if several bad harvests, or several harvests
yielding more than the average have preceded.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In another respect yet, the price of indispensable commodities
is very sensitive, because here the mere fear of a future
want of them has a far deeper and wider influence, than has
the fear of want of articles of luxury. No matter how good
the wheat crop may have been, if the weather afterwards
interferes with its harvesting, the price of wheat, in countries
in which the spirit of speculation is on the alert, will certainly
rise, because the prospect of the future crop then becomes
somewhat doubtful.<a href="#note_623" id="noteref_623" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">623</span></span></a>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page316">[pg 316]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg316"></a>
cost of production, although it always embraces whatever disappears
from the resources of the producer to enter into production,
varies very much according as it is considered from
the point of view of the individual's, the nation's or the world's
economy.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
An individual who pays taxes to his government, and who
has rented land and employed labor and capital to engage in
production, must indeed, besides the capital he has used in
such production, call all his outlay in interest, wages, rent,
and taxes, by the name of cost of production;<a href="#note_631" id="noteref_631" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">631</span></span></a> since, unless
they all come back to him in the price of the commodity, the
entire enterprise can only injure him.<a href="#note_632" id="noteref_632" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">632</span></span></a>
He will, of course, add
an equitable profit to remunerate him for his enterprise, since
without such profit, he would not be able to live or produce;
or else, he would be compelled to consume his capital. The
moment the current rates of taxation, interest, wages and rent
change in a country, the cost of production is also changed
in the case of the individual engaged in production, however
unaltered the technic process may remain.<a href="#note_633" id="noteref_633" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">633</span></span></a> But taking the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page317">[pg 317]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg317"></a>
nation, or all mankind into consideration, we must not lose
sight of the fact that these three great sources of income, as
well as taxation, are not, rightly speaking, sources from which
income flows, but rather channels through which the aggregate
income of the nation or the world is distributed among
individuals.<a href="#note_634" id="noteref_634" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">634</span></span></a> Hence the wages of labor, for instance, which
afford the means of living to the greater part of the population,
cannot possibly be looked upon simply as a factor in economic
production. The people considered in their entirety have
the soil gratis. All saving made from rent, interest on capital,
or wages, is nothing but a change of the proportion in
which the results of production were distributed hitherto
among coöperators in production. Such a change may be
either advantageous or the reverse; but it is not a diminution of
the amount of sacrifice which the people in general must make
for purposes of production. Hence, in a politico-economical
sense, to the cost of production, belongs only the capital
necessarily expended in production, and which has disappeared
as a part of the nation's resources, abstraction made of the
personal sacrifices in behalf of production.<a href="#note_635" id="noteref_635" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">635</span></span></a> The value of the

of course, be entirely restored in the price, that of the fixed

There are things which are a real risk in small enterprises
that by the intervention of an insurance company, or where
the enterprises are large and insure themselves, become a
more or less variable portion of the cost of production. The
price of the product, in the latter instance, rises, by this means,
very regularly. In the former case, the rise depends partly
on the feeling of the people whether their pleasure in gain is greater than their
grief over a corresponding loss.<a href="#note_638" id="noteref_638" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">638</span></span></a>

If the market price rises high above the cost of production,
producers make a profit greater than the average profit made
in the country. This induces them, by the appropriation of
new land and the employment of new labor and capital, to
increase their business. Other parties also engage in this
profitable department of trade. This competition not only
makes the means of production dearer, but must eventually,
by increasing the demand, reduce the price of the product to
the ordinary level of profit, that is to an equilibrium with other
commodities.<a href="#note_644" id="noteref_644" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">644</span></span></a>

There is no greater stimulus to the making of improvements
than the certainty of reward to the person who first introduces
one. The moment, however, that the improvement is

As to the alternative so frequently discussed, whether it is
preferable to make a large percentage of profit on the sale of
a small quantity of goods, or a small percentage on a large
quantity, we find that, in the lower stages of civilization, the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page322">[pg 322]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg322"></a>

In the case of commodities, he now runs but little risk
from a change of fashion, because the fashions of the masses
change much less rapidly than those of the upper circles of
society. In the case of indispensable goods, on the other hand,

If the market price sinks below the cost of production, the
producer naturally suffers a loss, and diminishes his stock as
soon as possible. That whole establishments engaged in industry
should forsake a branch of it which is suffering from
depression and enter a flourishing one, must ever remain a
rare exception.<a href="#note_649" id="noteref_649" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">649</span></span></a> But the discouraged manufacturer may

by new machinery; he may dismiss some of his workmen and
diminish the number of days during which the others shall
work. Moreover, most industries are operated by means of
borrowed capital, capital which must therefore, be returned to
the lender. Under certain circumstances, however, the industry
may be continued for some time, even at a real loss,<a href="#note_651" id="noteref_651" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">651</span></span></a> so
long as the loss of interest etc., which would follow the entire
suspension of the work, exceeds the loss produced by the lowering
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page324">[pg 324]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg324"></a>
of price, but hardly any longer. If the supply of the
commodity the price of which has fallen has been diminished,
the subsequent result depends on the causes which, in the first
place, brought about the fall in price. If the diminution in
price was caused solely by a too great supply, when this superabundant
supply is gotten rid of, the price will rise again.<a href="#note_652" id="noteref_652" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">652</span></span></a> If
it were produced by a decrease in the value in use of the commodity,
the diminution of the supply can restore the former
state of things only in so far as at least a part of the purchasers
ascribe to the commodity the same value in use as before.<a href="#note_653" id="noteref_653" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">653</span></span></a>
Lastly, if the lowering of the price came from a decrease in the
number of buyers, or from a decrease in their ability to purchase,
the former price will be restored when production has
been adapted to a correspondingly smaller circle of consumers.<a href="#note_654" id="noteref_654" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">654</span></span></a>

Most goods are produced at the same time, but under different
circumstances, at a very different cost. In order to
estimate the influence of this fact upon price, we must distinguish
between those commodities the cheapest manner of the
production of which may be extended at pleasure, and those in

to aid the cheapest.

In the former instance, the price of commodities is naturally
regulated by the least cost of production. The person who is
unable to sustain this competition permanently, would do a
great deal better to abandon the industry altogether; for it is
not in his power to raise the price by diminishing the supply;
more powerful rivals would then only need to correspondingly
increase theirs.<a href="#note_656" id="noteref_656" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">656</span></span></a>

If the same law were applicable, in the latter case, producers
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page326">[pg 326]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg326"></a>
placed in a less favorable situation would be compelled to immediately
abandon the market. The market, in consequence,
would no longer be able to provide for the aggregate need;
and the price of the commodity would continue to rise until
the producers who had been driven from the market returned
to it again. Hence, here, price in the long run is determined
by the cost of the production of the commodity, produced
under the least advantageous conditions, while such production
is necessary in order to satisfy the aggregate need. The
person engaged in production under more advantageous conditions
receives in the same price of the goods, which are
cheaper to him, an excess of profit; one which is greater in
proportion as his situation, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vis-a-vis</span></span> of production, is superior
to that of his less favored competitors.<a href="#note_657" id="noteref_657" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">657</span></span></a><a href="#note_658" id="noteref_658" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">658</span></span></a>

Hence the price of a commodity and the ratio between its
supply and demand mutually condition each other. On the
height of the price depends, in great part, how many purchasers
shall resolve to make an effectual demand; but, at the
same time, to what amount of cost of production, sellers shall
extend their supply.<a href="#note_659" id="noteref_659" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">659</span></span></a> We can speak of an equilibrium between
supply and demand only when the former corresponds with
the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">wish</span></em> of those who are ready to make good the full cost
of production. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Malthus.</span></span>) It has been asked, indeed, whether
it were more natural and better that demand should precede
supply or supply demand.<a href="#note_660" id="noteref_660" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">660</span></span></a>
But the inquiry is an illogical one,
when expressed in so general a manner, since supply and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page328">[pg 328]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg328"></a>
demand are only two sides of the same transaction. But, we
may say that in the case of indispensable goods, the want of
them (demand) is always felt sooner than the excess of them
(supply), and that in the case of goods which may be dispensed
with, including, originally, money, the reverse is true.
Besides, a person engaging in the production of any kind of
goods, can, as a rule, only seldom directly investigate the relation
between supply and demand. Generally, he can do no
more than compare the market price of the commodity with
the cost at which he can produce it. Many mistakes are inevitable
here; but the making of them is the necessary sacrifice
which must be endured to purchase the more than counterbalancing
advantages of free competition.<a href="#note_661" id="noteref_661" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">661</span></span></a>

The rule that goods which have the same cost of production
have also equal value in exchange, is applicable only to
the extent that it is possible to transfer the factors of production
at will from one branch of production to another. Where
this really free competition does not exist, the price depends
entirely on the quantity of the supply, compared with the
solvability or capacity to pay of the purchaser; and hence, it
may sometimes rise far above the cost of production (monopoly-price),
and sometimes sink far below it (forced price, or
under-price).<a href="#note_662" id="noteref_662" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">662</span></span></a> Such hindrances to competition depend, in part,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page329">[pg 329]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg329"></a>
upon natural causes. Thus, in the case of the works of art
of a deceased artist, which cannot be increased in number;<a href="#note_663" id="noteref_663" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">663</span></span></a>
or in that of living celebrities who cannot extend their mental
activity in the same degree that their reputation has grown.
So, also, in the case of precious stones, which are sometimes
found free, and therefore cost nothing, but which, at the
same time, have a high price.<a href="#note_664" id="noteref_664" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">664</span></span></a> Many valuable agricultural
products are, together with their production, limited to a
definite and sometimes very small district.<a href="#note_665" id="noteref_665" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">665</span></span></a> It is to be regarded
as a modification of such natural monopolies when substitutes
for a kind of goods which diminish, at least in part,
the demand for them, are found, at a cheaper price; for instance,
ordinary table-wines in the stead of fine wines. The
rule applies much more strictly to those goods which, on
account of their greater quantity, can replace inferior ones,<a href="#note_666" id="noteref_666" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">666</span></span></a>
than it does to those where this is not possible.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The principal cause of forced or under-prices (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">Schleuderpreise</span></span>)
is the facility with which the product deteriorates, and
must, therefore, find a quick sale, especially when its storage
or transportation is attended by further difficulties.<a href="#note_667" id="noteref_667" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">667</span></span></a> But, very
durable commodities are also subject to under-prices, and especially
those which last longest, because the supply of them
can be diminished only very slowly. Thus, for instance,
houses, in a declining city. Distress-prices are found most
usually in the case of such commodities as are produced without
any intention to produce them, as for instance, rags and
excrementitious substances. The more the mere forces of
nature preponderate in production, the less can the supply
be increased or decreased at pleasure, the more frequently, as
a consequence, do we find monopoly-prices and under-prices.
(Compare § <a class="tei tei-ref pginternal" href="#Section_131">131</a> ff.) Thus the production of wheat is
invariably connected with the order of the seasons. Between seed-time
and harvest, there are a number of months which neither
capital nor skill can shorten to any extent. The cultivation of
land, to be very much greater and more lasting, supposes so
many conditions precedent, increase of live stock, buildings etc.,
that it can be attained only after a series of years. Hence it
happens that wheat, much more than manufactured products,
is subject to oppressively high prices and oppressively low ones,
during a long period of time. No matter what the influence
of the forces operating in the opposite direction may be, the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page331">[pg 331]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg331"></a>
price of wheat depends most largely on the result of the last
crop.<a href="#note_668" id="noteref_668" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">668</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Other impediments in the way of freedom of competition
have their origin in social conditions. The rule governing
prices applies only where the vendor and purchaser are equally
ready to exchange. But in every case in which the producer
carries on his business, not for the sake of free gain, but
simply to obtain a means of livelihood, it may be subject to
many important exceptions.<a href="#note_669" id="noteref_669" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">669</span></span></a>
The richer a seller is, the longer
can he wait for a favorable opportunity to sell. Thus, for instance,
wheat is somewhat lower in price at times when payments
are universally made than at other seasons of the year,
because a great many country people are then compelled to
sell. Where the country population are universally needy, it
sinks after a harvest to an unusually low figure, and in spring
rises again very high.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Sometimes price is affected by the agreements of the purchaser
or seller, but most readily by those of middlemen between
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page332">[pg 332]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg332"></a>

classes may exert the same influence, and such customs are
especially powerful in the lower stages of business and industrial
development. They, even at the present time, take
the place, frequently, of freedom of competition in retail business,
in the book business, and in the determination of lawyers'
and doctors' fees, as well as in the distribution of a nation's income among the three
great branches of its general economy,<a href="#note_671" id="noteref_671" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">671</span></span></a>

No power can, of course, fix the price of a commodity in
the long run, which cannot at the same time fix the relation
of supply and demand. Hence, set prices fixed by governmental
authority can be made to play a part in practice only
in so far as they do not establish a price in opposition to the
real state of things, only to the extent that they give undoubted
expression to it in a manner in harmony with natural
conditions. With this restriction, set or fixed prices may, in
the absence of real competition, which can always best determine
prices, be useful to both parties; otherwise one party
would at one time, and the other at another, profit by an unjust
advantage; but it would not be long before both would
suffer from the perturbation caused thereby in all commercial
transactions. How pleasant it is for a traveler in Switzerland,
or even in Italy, to find set prices established there.<a href="#note_675" id="noteref_675" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">675</span></span></a>

to its variableness in quality; and where there are different

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On the whole, prices become more and more regular as
national-economic civilization advances. Progress in civilization
tends to bring the parties engaged in the struggle for prices
that is buyers and sellers, nearer to one another, in so far as it
uniformly decreases the cost of production, and increases the
purchaser's ability to pay.<a href="#note_679" id="noteref_679" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">679</span></span></a> (See §
<a class="tei tei-ref pginternal" href="#Section_101">101</a>.) The more universal division
of labor makes commercial intercourse more necessary
to every one, at the same time that it makes it more of a habit
to him; and hence exchange ceases more and more to be a
matter of caprice or chance. The better means of transportation
and communication render it easier, in every way, for
supply and demand to meet. With the advance of general enlightenment
and education, an acquaintance with commodities
also becomes more general, and every purchaser is on a better
way to be able to estimate the cost of production which the
seller has to bear. Hence, fraudulent prices and prices founded
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page336">[pg 336]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg336"></a>
in error become less frequent; and all this is helped forward
by the greater accuracy of weights and measures. The increase
of population makes competition more active in all
branches of trade, while at the same time, with the greater
freedom of circulation, a number of causes which previously
operated to produce very high prices in one place and very low
ones in another are removed.<a href="#note_680" id="noteref_680" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">680</span></span></a> But especially, the growth of a
distinct class of merchants leads to a uniformity in price. This
class are incited by their own interest to purchase at low prices
and sell at high prices. Thus, their competition in the former
case raises prices, and lowers them in the latter.<a href="#note_681" id="noteref_681" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">681</span></span></a> In all lower
stages of civilization, the custom of making offers and beating
down in price plays a great part, while where culture is
higher, the system of fixed prices (but not by government)
gains ground continually. Here Turgot's principle is applicable,
viz.: that the current price of an article is tacitly understood
when one asks a merchant the price of his wares.<a href="#note_682" id="noteref_682" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">682</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This proposition is true in the case of individuals, as well as of
classes and of whole nations.<a href="#note_683" id="noteref_683" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">683</span></span></a> It is plain, that under a system
of fixed prices we can more certainly discover what the equitable
price is, than in the heat of higgling which besides consumes
a great deal of precious time. Lastly, one of the principal
requisites of a well developed scale of prices is national honor,
and this, doubtless, increases in the higher stages of civilization,
not only because of the greater moral culture which
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page338">[pg 338]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg338"></a>
then prevails, but also and especially because that which constitutes a people's real
and best interests is better understood.<a href="#note_684" id="noteref_684" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">684</span></span></a>
Among declining nations, many of these developments take a
retrogressive road. The very great distinction between rich
and poor, between educated and uneducated, again produces
great fluctuations in price. A proletarian people who have
sunk so low as to live on potatoes will suffer much more from
variations in price and of the means of subsistence than a
people who live on wheat; for the reason that it is so difficult
to export or to preserve<a href="#note_685" id="noteref_685" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">685</span></span></a> potatoes. Nor can it be doubted, that
the greatest possible constancy of prices is the most beneficial
condition that the general economy of a people can be in.
Where prices change while the cost of production remains the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page339">[pg 339]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg339"></a>
same, one person can only gain what the other has lost. But
such unmerited gains and undeserved losses have an invariable
tendency to destroy the deepest roots of a people's economic
activity; and intentional speculation based upon such change usually assumes
an immoral character. (Stock-jobbing.)<a href="#note_686" id="noteref_686" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">686</span></span></a>
Even if Macleod be right, that an increase or decrease
in prices is to be regarded as a warning of excess, the former
of excess of consumption, the latter of production, no one will
doubt that it is the interest of every organism to confine pain
within the smallest possible limits, even if its consequences
are so beneficial to the preservation of the whole body.

Wherever the division of labor is very highly developed,
the continuance of barter, or the direct exchange of one object
of consumption for another, presents difficulties well nigh
insurmountable. How difficult it would be always to find the
person who could supply us with precisely what we wanted,
and at the same time have need of what we had a surplus
of.<a href="#note_687" id="noteref_687" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">687</span></span></a> But how much less frequently would it happen that one's
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page341">[pg 341]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg341"></a>
want and another's surplus would correspond exactly the one
to the other in quantity; that, for instance, the manufacturer
of nails, desirous of exchanging his nails for a cow, should
meet a cattle-dealer who should want exactly as many nails
as a cow is worth! Here there is one chief difficulty in the
way, viz.: that there are so many commodities which cannot
be divided without causing a diminution or even a destruction
of their value; and that others cannot be stored away in any
quantity without becoming a very heavy burthen to their
owner. How useful it would therefore be, if there was one
commodity which should be acceptable to every person, at all
times, especially if in addition to this, it possessed the qualities
of durability, capacity for transportation and for being stored

of this one commodity would then be certain of being able to
obtain all other exchangeable commodities through its instrumentality;
and every seller would be satisfied to exchange
what he had to dispose of against this <span class="tei tei-q">“universal commodity.”</span>
If two values are equal to a third, they are equal to each
other. It is, therefore, a simple matter to use this most current
of all commodities, with which all others are most frequently
compared, as a measure of the relative values of all
other exchangeable commodities. There is need of such a
measure, and it is analogous to the want experienced by the
mathematician who has a column of fractions to sum up, and
who does it by first reducing them all to a common denominator.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
By the introduction of money, most exchanges are divided
into two halves: purchase and sale.<a href="#note_694" id="noteref_694" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">694</span></span></a> We may also say with
Schlözer, that by its means, exchange, for the first time, becomes
a sale, and obscure value in exchange, clear and definite
price. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Permatio vicina emtioni</span></span>). Were there no money,
the party to an exchange, occupying the most advantageous
economic position, would possess a much greater superiority
over the other than he does now. Many a bread-buyer, especially,
would be half starved before he could agree with the
seller on the quantity of bread to be received in exchange for
the commodity he had to dispose of. The producer of the
means of subsistence would here possess an extreme advantage,
since the urgent necessity of the exchange for the one
party, and the power of the other to postpone it, would make the determination
of the price an entirely arbitrary matter.<a href="#note_695" id="noteref_695" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">695</span></span></a>
Hence, the development of money as the instrument of trade,
keeps pace with the development of individual liberty. Payment
of wages in money makes the workman more responsible
for his husbandry etc., but at the same time, freer, than payment
in produce. Now, also, a higher division of labor becomes possible;
for the easier it is to obtain everything else for money,
the easier it is for each person to devote himself exclusively to
one branch of business.<a href="#note_696" id="noteref_696" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">696</span></span></a>
Without money, too, only ready
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page348">[pg 348]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg348"></a>
commodities could be exchanged one against another. Only
when money has become the instrument of trade, is it possible
to separate the net from the gross returns, and, therefore, to
manage income properly. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Schäffle</span></span>). Now, also, it becomes
for the first time really remunerative to produce more than
one needs for his own use, and to save. Without money, the
owner of any one kind of capital, who could not employ it
himself, would be obliged, if he desired to loan it, to find not
only a person who was in need of capital, but one who needed
the very kind of capital he had. For instance, the person who
had one horse too many, would be obliged to look for another
who was in need of one etc. And how difficult a task it would be
to determine the amount of interest, if it had to be paid in produce
or kind, and even to make a return in produce or kind of
capital which had been presumably used. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Storch</span></span>). Moveable
property or resources can attain importance only after the introduction
of good money, since, previous to such introduction,
it was by reason of its great variety,<a href="#note_697" id="noteref_697" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">697</span></span></a>
and of its perishable nature,
immensely inferior to landed property. Hence it is, that
money, in a nation's economy, is what the blood is in the life
of the animal. It is, so to speak, the common reservoir in
which all food is first dissolved, and by which, at a later stage,
the elements of nutrition and preservation are distributed to
the several organs.<a href="#note_698" id="noteref_698" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">698</span></span></a>
There is, indeed, no machine which has
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page349">[pg 349]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg349"></a>
saved as much labor as money. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lauderdale</span></span>). It is true that
the shadows which wealth is wont to cast, extravagance, avarice
and inequality of every kind, may readily grow longer
and darker in consequence of the introduction of money.<a href="#note_699" id="noteref_699" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">699</span></span></a> But
may not the knife which, in the hands of the surgeon, does so
much for life, become an instrument of danger in the hands of
a child? The invention of money has been rightly compared to the

C. That metals were used for the purpose of money much
later than the commodities above mentioned, and the precious
metals in turn later than the non-precious metals, cannot by
any means be shown to be universally true. Rather is gold
in some countries to be obtained by the exercise of so little
skill, and both gold and silver satisfy a want<a href="#note_709" id="noteref_709" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">709</span></span></a> so live and general,
and one so early felt, that they are to be met with as an
instrument of exchange in very early times.<a href="#note_710" id="noteref_710" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">710</span></span></a> In the case of
isolated races, much depends on the nature of the metals with
which the geologic constitution of the country has furnished
them.<a href="#note_711" id="noteref_711" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">711</span></span></a> In general, however, the above law is found to prevail
here. The higher the development of a people becomes,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page355">[pg 355]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg355"></a>
the more frequent is the occurrence of large payments;
and to effect these, the more costly a metal is, the better, of
course, it is adapted to effect such payments. Besides, only
rich nations are able to possess the costly metals in a quantity
absolutely great.<a href="#note_712" id="noteref_712" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">712</span></span></a> Among the Jews, gold as money, dates only

introduced silver money into Greece, about the middle of the
eighth century before Christ. Gold came into use at a much
later period.<a href="#note_714" id="noteref_714" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">714</span></span></a> The Romans struck silver money, for the first time, in 209 before Christ,

Among modern nations, Venice (1285) and Florence seem to have been the first
to have coined gold in any quantity.<a href="#note_716" id="noteref_716" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">716</span></span></a>
Henry III. of England (ob. 1272), was the first to coin gold,
but with so little success, that for a long time after, Edward
III. (ob. 1377) was regarded as the first English monarch who
had coined gold.<a href="#note_717" id="noteref_717" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">717</span></span></a>
How little a barbarous people are in a
condition to make use of very costly material as money, is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page356">[pg 356]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg356"></a>
proved by the account which Tacitus gives of the ancient
Germans, who preferred silver to gold in trade.<a href="#note_718" id="noteref_718" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">718</span></span></a> England
presents us with an instance of the other extreme. Since
1816, silver, in that country, has been used only as a species
of change, and the circulation of gold governs in almost all
commercial transactions.<a href="#note_719" id="noteref_719" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">719</span></span></a>

D. The local usage of some countries has raised many
other commodities to the dignity of instruments of exchange,
especially where the population are poor and the metals which
might be used as money have not existed in sufficient quantities
or in the requisite proportion. But people have always
limited themselves in the material of their money to such
commodities as are universally acceptable, as uniform as may
be, and current as articles of export or import.<a href="#note_720" id="noteref_720" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">720</span></span></a>

as the instrument of exchange, depends on
the greatness and uniformity of their value in exchange, but
especially on their durability and pliancy as to form.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This value in exchange is great, because their beauty, which consists
in their luster and their sonorous ring,<a href="#note_722" id="noteref_722" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">722</span></span></a> gives them
great value in use; and because, at the same time, their rarity
in nature makes the supply of them relatively small,<a href="#note_723" id="noteref_723" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">723</span></span></a> and not
susceptible of increase at pleasure.<a href="#note_724" id="noteref_724" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">724</span></span></a> As they contain so large
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page359">[pg 359]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg359"></a>
a value in so small a volume, they are adapted to transportation from one place to
another, with but little difficulty—a matter of the greatest importance in an
instrument of exchange.<a href="#note_725" id="noteref_725" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">725</span></span></a>
Hence, it is much easier to keep the demand for
them and the supply of them at a level all over the world,
than it is the demand and supply of most other commodities.
And this all the more as there are not different kinds of gold
and silver, but only different qualities of their fineness.<a href="#note_726" id="noteref_726" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">726</span></span></a> It
also contributes to the uniformity of their value in exchange,
that they minister mainly only to wants of luxury. The most
indispensable commodities are subject to the greatest variations
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page360">[pg 360]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg360"></a>
in price (see § <a class="tei tei-ref pginternal" href="#Section_103">103</a>), whereas, in the case of the
precious metals, the diversity of uses to which they may be turned
contributes greatly to render their value, as instruments of exchange,
more equable. If the supply of them be small, gold
and silver vessels are less in demand; a part of the old ones
are melted down, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vice versa</span></span>.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In durability, the precious metals surpass almost all other
commodities. They are not at all affected by air or water,
and they can be corroded only by very few fluids. Fire may,
indeed, change their form, but scarcely in any degree the
value of the material of gold, and that of silver very little, and
then only when it is subjected to a very powerful blast or
draught of air.<a href="#note_727" id="noteref_727" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">727</span></span></a><a href="#note_728" id="noteref_728" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">728</span></span></a>
Hence, while by laying them by, they
suffer virtually nothing at all (a most valuable article is an
article to deposit savings in), their wear and tear from use may
be very much decreased by an admixture with other metals
in the proper proportion.<a href="#note_729" id="noteref_729" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">729</span></span></a>
This durability contributes largely
to keep the price of the precious metals more uniform. By
the time that the wheat crop is rightly harvested, the great
bulk of the previously stored wheat is, as a rule, consumed;
and, therefore, the supply of wheat depends almost entirely on
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page361">[pg 361]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg361"></a>
the yield of the last crop. On the other hand, it is probable
that there is many a piece of money, the raw material of which
was dug from Thracian gold mines in the time of King Philip
or from the silver mines of Spain during the reign of Hannibal,
in circulation to-day. Compared with the immeasurable stores
of gold and silver which have gone on accumulating for thousands
of years, the new yield of them, in any one year, is lost
like a drop in a bucket. Hence, only when the yield of the mines
has continued for a very long time, or when it is exceedingly
great or remarkably small, can the price of their products
change to any great extent.<a href="#note_730" id="noteref_730" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">730</span></span></a> Even during the revolution in

The original value in use of the precious metals, to satisfy
certain wants of luxury in the most aesthetic and the most substantial
manner, continues still; but with the advance of civilization,
the employment of gold and silver for this purpose
has fallen farther and farther behind the more recent employment
of these metals as the best material for money. And
since now the services rendered by money may be divided into
two classes: storing up or preservation, and the transmission
(division, concentration) of values,<a href="#note_737" id="noteref_737" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">737</span></span></a> the former always plays a
greater part in the earlier states of the development of trade

The person who, in times when there is a dearth of goods,
and especially of capital, complains of a want of money, commits
the same error as if he ascribed a scarcity or absence of
grain, when it exists, to a too small number of wagons to carry
it, or to the narrowness of country highways. The inference
may, indeed, be sometimes well-founded, but certainly only by
way of exception; and yet it is generally the first which politico-economical

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The value in exchange of money is said to be high when
all other commodities estimated in money are cheap; and low
in the opposite case. We have here to do with the application
of the most general of all laws of price; therefore, with
the demand and supply of money. The demand for it depends
on the wants and the means of payment of its purchasers.
Therefore, if a country has little trade, it will, on this account,
need only few instruments of trade, that is, of little money
to effect exchanges. If it be poor in other goods, it will get
little money in exchange. In the former respect, there is a
beneficent principle of equalization or compensation which decreases
the price-variations of money, no matter of what kind,
in the necessity, when the number of business transactions remains
the same and money becomes cheaper, to use more of it,
and less when it becomes dearer.<a href="#note_741" id="noteref_741" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">741</span></span></a> The supply of money is, in
the long run, dependent chiefly on the cost of production.
But since the cost of production in different mines is very different,
the value in exchange of the precious metals is determined
by the cost of producing them from the poorest mines
which must be worked in order to supply the aggregate
want of them. (See § <a class="tei tei-ref pginternal" href="#Section_110">110</a>.)<a href="#note_742" id="noteref_742" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">742</span></span></a> The more unfavorable the conditions
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page366">[pg 366]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg366"></a>
of their production are, the greater is the quantity of
commodities which must be given for a pound of gold, silver
etc.; that producers may not be deterred from the prosecution
of their work. The extremes of the value in exchange
of money are dependent on the use for which it is intended.
That value cannot rise higher than to the point at
which single pieces of money become inconvenient on account
of their smallness, nor sink lower than the point at which a
similar inconvenience is produced by their too great size. In
both instances, it would become necessary to have recourse
to other instruments of exchange.

evidently, increases (see § <a class="tei tei-ref pginternal" href="#Section_56">56</a>, ff.) with every advance

but on its rapidity also.<a href="#note_747" id="noteref_747" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">747</span></span></a> The economic use of money does
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page369">[pg 369]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg369"></a>

amount of the medium of circulation in a state must be equal
to the sum of the payments made in it in a given time, divided

nations with a healthy economic life this number is always
made up of men noted for the good management of their
own affairs) inclined to pay out the money which they had
taken in, rapidly, a very active production would prevail
everywhere; and this, in turn, supposes general commercial
freedom and great legal security. The less these conditions
are developed, the more difficult it becomes, not only to lay
out the money received to-day productively to-morrow, but
the more imperatively does a proper foresight demand, that a
reserve-fund should be maintained for times of necessity.

present supply.<a href="#note_751" id="noteref_751" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">751</span></span></a>

In less civilized countries, the same condition of things leads
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page370">[pg 370]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg370"></a>
the people even to bury their money-treasures. In large
cities, the circulation of money is generally more rapid than
in the country districts; in a thickly populated than in a thinly populated country;
and in trade than in agriculture.<a href="#note_752" id="noteref_752" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">752</span></span></a> Every
improvement in the means of intercommunication tends to facilitate
it. The rich man possesses, as a rule, less money, relatively
speaking, than the poorer man. Hence, a more equable
division of a nation's resources among the people would increase
the amount of money needed.<a href="#note_753" id="noteref_753" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">753</span></span></a> While the concentration,
as to time, of circulation into few great terms of payment
is calculated of itself to cause a large sum of money to remain
idle in the interval,<a href="#note_754" id="noteref_754" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">754</span></span></a> its concentration in space in large
commercial cities must dispense with the necessity of a great number
of instruments of exchange. In England, it is customary
for every man in comfortable circumstances, as soon as he receives
any money, to deposit with a banker, and to make all
his payments by means of checks upon the latter. Cash
money is now employed by Londoners only in payment of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page371">[pg 371]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg371"></a>
wages, and in trade between retail dealers and consumers.
The banker is there the common cashier of a great number of
private individuals, and is in a condition to make their payments
for them with a much smaller amount of money, especially
when they are to be made by one of his depositors to
another.<a href="#note_755" id="noteref_755" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">755</span></span></a> This <span class="tei tei-q">“union of money-chests”</span>

in greater or smaller numbers, are wont to have one bank as
a center; and the country banks, in turn, to be in constant relation
with the great moneyed institutions of London, subject to
a species of general superintendence by the Bank of England.
These great monetary institutions have, so to speak, a common
rendezvous at the Clearing-House, where the greater part of
their payments are made by a mere off-setting of debits and
credits;<a href="#note_756" id="noteref_756" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">756</span></span></a>

Of the three conditions above mentioned, it is evident that
the first operates on the amount of money needed, in a direction
opposite to that of the other two. The usual course of
development is this: among an advancing people, the number
of money transactions increases at first; later, when education
has become general, and the people have grown habituated
to the giving and receiving of credit, the circulation of money
is accelerated, and an increase of the substitutes for money
effected. Hence, it is perfectly natural that the money-need
of a people whose public economy is only half developed,
should, in proportion to the number of inhabitants, be greater,
not only than that of a people whose economy is wholly undeveloped,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The peculiar properties of the precious metals described
above (§ <a class="tei tei-ref pginternal" href="#Section_120">120</a>), explains satisfactorily enough, why, at
the same
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page375">[pg 375]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg375"></a>
time, but in different countries, they have more nearly the
same value in exchange than any other commodity whatever.
Like a fluid in tubes which communicate with one another,
the precious metals seek the one same level of value the whole
world over.<a href="#note_762" id="noteref_762" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">762</span></span></a> Only, it must not be supposed that every absolute
or relative increase of the amount of money in a country
must produce immediately a corresponding diminution of the
value of money; and in addition to this cause an exportation
of money.<a href="#note_763" id="noteref_763" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">763</span></span></a> If the number of trade-transactions increases in
the same proportion as the amount of money, the value of
money remains entirely unaffected.<a href="#note_764" id="noteref_764" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">764</span></span></a>
The same thing occurs
when the increased influx of money, instead of overflowing
the channels of circulation, only swells the volume in the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page376">[pg 376]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg376"></a>
ready-money reservoirs. By means of these stores of ready
money, very large payments may be made by one nation to
another, without changing the circulation, or, therefore, the
value of money, in the slightest degree, on either side.<a href="#note_765" id="noteref_765" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">765</span></span></a>
If, indeed, such payments should continue for a long time to flow
in the same direction, they would certainly influence the circulation,
and then produce a current in the opposite direction.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
However, it may happen, that the value of money in different
countries may be permanently different, when there are
lasting difficulties in the way of the leveling influence of the
incoming or outgoing current of money. Thus, the precious
metals maintain a high value in those countries especially which
can obtain them only by giving commodities difficult of transportation
for them. If, for instance, an Englishman, anxious
to take advantage of the high value of money in Poland,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page377">[pg 377]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg377"></a>
should cause Polish articles, such as wheat, wood, wool etc.,
to be imported into England, they would reach their destination
very much increased in price, because of the great cost
of transportation. Whether Poland or England would have
to bear this cost depends on the relations of supply and demand.
Certain it is, however, that the migration of money
is hereby rendered exceedingly difficult, forbidden even within
the limits of certain value-differences, especially where the
means of communication are universally bad. And so, the
smaller the number of countries which minister to the want of
commodities of precious-metal districts, the more must other
nations obtain the money they need only at second and third
hand; by means of which, naturally, money itself is made
dearer each time. Now, it is, as a rule, nations in a low stage
of civilization, that engage in the exportation of raw material,
and they are the worst adapted to engaging directly in the
carrying on of trade. When, therefore, they do not possess
gold or silver mines themselves, money-value is, as a rule,
highest with them; especially as the absence of legal security
and protection, which generally obtains there, makes the value
in use of the precious metals one of great urgency to them.<a href="#note_766" id="noteref_766" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">766</span></span></a><a href="#note_767" id="noteref_767" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">767</span></span></a>

Precious Metals. (Continued.)</span></h3>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Most nations can satisfy their want of the precious metals,
only through the medium of foreign trade. Hence they very
naturally look upon the cost of production of the articles of
export by the exchange of which they obtain the precious
metals either directly or indirectly, as the cost of production of
these metals themselves. But, the rule that all commodities of
equal cost of production have equal value in exchange is applicable
only within the limits of the same economic territory
(§ <a class="tei tei-ref pginternal" href="#Section_107">107</a>), for it is
frequently physically impossible, and still more
frequently rendered difficult, by laws, customs and states of
mind to transfer factors of production from one country to
another simply on account of the more advantageous market
they would there find. Thus, for instance, when England
exchanges its cotton and woolen goods, and steel instruments
for Mexican silver, the cost of production of the two equivalents
may be very different, and the one party in this trade
may permanently make a larger profit than the other.<a href="#note_769" id="noteref_769" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">769</span></span></a> According
to § <a class="tei tei-ref pginternal" href="#Section_101">101</a>, that party will be most favored in whom the
desire of holding to his own commodities is farthest from being
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page379">[pg 379]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg379"></a>
out-weighed by his desire to obtain the other. But, at
bottom, silver is no very indispensable article. Especially in
highly civilized commercial communities, it is easiest to obtain
substitutes for it, while the principal articles of English
export are, for the most part, objects with which to satisfy
wants rather urgent in their nature, very general, and of rapid
growth; and which, besides, are not, to any extent, difficult
of transportation. It is not a matter of surprise, therefore,
that English commodities, in silver countries, are generally
sold above the mean price between the English cost of production
and the Mexican, for instance, or the cost of procuring
them elsewhere; and that silver, on the other hand, is sold
in England, under the same. But this lowers the price of the
precious metals of the latter country in general. Hence a
change in the channels of international trade, which in most
countries is the only source of gold and silver, may make the
price of the precious metals dearer in one place and cheaper in
another, even when the conditions of the production of mines
remain entirely unaltered.<a href="#note_770" id="noteref_770" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">770</span></span></a> In an isolated country, any
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page380">[pg 380]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg380"></a>
amount of gold and silver whatever would, finally, as soon as
the people had grown accustomed to it, suffice for all the
wants of circulation. But, in commerce with the rest of the
world, the greater quantity and greater cheapness of the
precious metals, that is of those commodities which are most
current and are possessed of the greatest amount of economic
energy, must, without fail, be of the greatest advantage to a
country; and this irrespective of the fact that they are under
certain circumstances the symptom of an especially highly
developed public economy. If we suppose two nations, A and
B, equal in every other point, but that A has twice as much
money as B, and that prices are twice as high there as in B;
yet, with the same effort or sacrifice, A could levy twice as
many taxes as B. In case of a war between them, A might
pay in ready money for the necessities of an army which had
invaded B, with one-fourth the sacrifice which B would have
to make to support its army in A, if we reverse the case, and
suppose that B had invaded A.<a href="#note_771" id="noteref_771" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">771</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If we had a measure of prices with the same universality of
application and the same unchangeableness as the measure of
length, which is determined by astronomical calculation, we
should be able, not only to clearly understand all the data relating
to value, that is to say, a not unimportant portion of historical
science, but we should, moreover, have a practical means to
condition and fix even perpetual annuities, in such a way, that
they would always afford the same economic and purchasing
power to the person receiving them. No wonder, therefore,
that political economists since Petty's time have zealously labored to find a
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">constant</span></em> measure of prices.<a href="#note_772" id="noteref_772" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">772</span></span></a> If by this we
understand a species of goods such that it should always maintain
equal exchange-power, as compared with all other commodities,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page382">[pg 382]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg382"></a>
the idea of a <span class="tei tei-q">“constant”</span> measure of prices is unthinkable.
We would have to suppose here, that not a single
kind of goods varied in its price; since, otherwise, at least as
compared with those that varied in price, the measure of
prices would itself be variable.<a href="#note_773" id="noteref_773" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">773</span></span></a> But we may, indeed, search
for a kind of goods such that its inherent elements and the elements
peculiar to it, so far as it is itself concerned, and which
go to determine price, should exert the same uniform influence
at all times. If there be such a kind of goods, and its value
in exchange as compared with other kinds of goods were to
vary, we should be certain, at least, that the cause of the
change was not in it, but in them; that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">it</span></em> had not grown
dearer or cheaper, but that they had grown cheaper or
dearer. Such a kind of goods would have these two characteristics:
A. A given amount of it would, under all circumstances,
have the same value in use for the same number
of persons. B. It would require, under all circumstances,
the same cost to produce it, and therefore the supply might
always keep pace exactly with the number of those who demanded
it.<a href="#note_774" id="noteref_774" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">774</span></span></a> In this way the supply and demand of this kind
of goods, abstraction made of the quantity of counter-values,
would preserve forever the same invariable relation.

He adopts, because of the great differences in work, the average
work of the common manual laborer. One work-day, and
the sacrifice of <span class="tei tei-q">“rest, freedom and happiness”</span> therewith connected,
are, under all circumstances, attended with the same
inconvenience (value). If at one time this day's labor will exchange
for more, and at another for less, of any kind of goods, it is only because the price
of the latter has fallen or risen.<a href="#note_775" id="noteref_775" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">775</span></span></a>

But we may ask whether the same sacrifice of liberty is as
great a hardship to a Russian as to a Bedouin; or whether
the sacrifice of an equal amount of rest is as hard for the New
Englander as it is for a Turk, or as difficult to endure on a
hot day in July as in the cold of winter. Besides, we have
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page384">[pg 384]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg384"></a>
here to do primarily only with value in exchange; and that
value in the case of day-laborers' work is subject to very
great fluctuations.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The elements on which the demand and supply of labor
depend are not, in themselves, invariable, nor do their variations
usually compensate for one another. In progressive nations,
the value in use of day-laborers' work increases as well
as the capacity of their employers to pay them; but, at the
same time, as a rule, and at least relatively speaking, the supply
of labor diminishes on account of the increase in the cost
of production of workmen. Precisely the reverse of this happens
in nations in their decline, and in over-populated nations.
The workman is subjected to the necessity of accepting distress-prices
for his work, and especially of accepting them for a
long space of time.<a href="#note_776" id="noteref_776" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">776</span></span></a> How often it happens that, if only

Ricardo's school employs, as the measure of the price of
various kinds of goods, the quantity of work by which the
goods themselves are produced.<a href="#note_778" id="noteref_778" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">778</span></span></a> It is evident that the same
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page385">[pg 385]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg385"></a>
amount of common labor produces very different results, according
as it is well or badly conducted. Hence Ricardo
must have used the word labor in the sense of labor ideally
adapted to its end. But in this way it would be impossible to
reduce all the different kinds of labor to a common denominator.<a href="#note_779" id="noteref_779" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">779</span></span></a>

It is no more possible to find a constant measure of prices
than it is to square the circle. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">J. B. Say.</span></span>) If the two magnitudes
to be compared are separated from each other in
space but not in time, the precious metals constitute not only
the best measure of their prices, but also a very good one.
But the precious metals are subject to very sensible and accidental
variations in price in long periods of time. If, therefore,
we would compare sums of money belonging to different
times with one another, we must first construct a price-current
list of all the more important articles of commerce for the
time in question, and in the quantities they are needed in every
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page386">[pg 386]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg386"></a>
day life. We would next have to calculate the average of
these mean prices, and thus to determine the relative value of
the amounts to be estimated.<a href="#note_781" id="noteref_781" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">781</span></span></a> The person who should
limit his comparison to a few species of commodities, says von
Mangoldt, would lose in exactness what he gained in comprehensibility.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In every such list, the wages of a day would occupy a very
important place. The desire of exerting an influence over the
lives and actions of other men, and the desire of relatively
greater social distinction as compared with the social distinction
of others, is very general; and there is scarcely any better
evidence that it has been attained than the possession of the
power of controlling a large number of days' work. The man
who can keep one thousand day laborers is certainly, in a politico-economical
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page387">[pg 387]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg387"></a>
sense, an important personage. Besides, the
height of day-wages has the most direct influence on the price
of many other commodities.<a href="#note_782" id="noteref_782" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">782</span></span></a>

No less important is the price of wheat, or rather of the
principal article of food of the people, for the time being, with
which the price of inland raw material—in so far as it can be produced from the
same soil alternately with wheat—and, in the long run, also the wages of labor,
are so essentially connected.<a href="#note_783" id="noteref_783" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">783</span></span></a>
The same indispensable necessity of wheat which
causes its price to fluctuate so largely from year to year, and
from month to month, promotes the uniformity of its average
price,<a href="#note_784" id="noteref_784" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">784</span></span></a> when many years are taken into the

(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Malthus.</span></span>) If, by reason of great progress made in the art of
agriculture, the cost of the production of wheat should fall to
one-half of what it was, a large increase of population would
certainly not be delayed long. And so, on the other hand,
there would be a decrease of population if, by the destruction
of artificial means of irrigation, or other steps in the direction
of a retrogressive civilization, the cost of the production of
wheat were to be permanently increased.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But even the average price of wheat, during a long series
of years, is not entirely invariable. The increasing consumption
compels the nation, as a whole, to provide for its requirement
of wheat from less fertile sources, which increases its
price generally. It is true that the progress of the science of
agriculture and of the corn-trade counteract this tendency,
retard the advance of the price of wheat, and may, for a time,
produce an opposite tendency. It is true, also, that the people
are induced by their most general and vital interests to take
advantage of this possibility. But spite of the frequency of
exceptions to it, the rule remains.<a href="#note_787" id="noteref_787" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">787</span></span></a> If, therefore, we wished
to so fix a perpetual annuity that it should always be worth
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page389">[pg 389]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg389"></a>
as much money as a certain quantity of wheat had cost, on
an average, during the three preceding decades, the thing-value
of this annuity would, on the whole, rise with an advance
in civilization.<a href="#note_788" id="noteref_788" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">788</span></span></a>
To obtain something that would remain
the same, it would be necessary to combine wheat with
at least one chief commodity, the intrinsic basis of the price of
which had a development independent of the price of grain;
but the whole to be made payable in money. The precious
metals are, in many respects, so diametrically opposed in properties
to wheat, in their dispensableness, transportable character
and durability, for instance, that these two classes of
commodities are best adapted to act as counter-balances to
each other.<a href="#note_789" id="noteref_789" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">789</span></span></a>

not only by the almost unlimited capacity of labor and capital
to be increased, while the natural forces which have value in
exchange are susceptible of increase to so small an extent;
but also, and especially, because new additions of labor and capital
are wont to cause relatively smaller results in the production
of raw material, and relatively larger ones in industry and commerce. (§

Hence, from the relations the prices of the different classes

conclusions as to the degree of civilization which a country has
attained. The above law also affords an explanation of the
fact, that a young nation, which has made no great strides in
the way of development, and in which, of course, the production
of raw material preponderates, draw their commercial
and manufactured necessaries, by way of preference, from
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page391">[pg 391]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg4391"></a>
precisely the most highly civilized foreign nations. The latter
are in a condition, and accustomed, to give the largest quantity

A. In the case of a great many raw materials, we repeatedly
find the following to be the course of development. In
the lower stages of civilization, they grow of themselves, and
in such quantities that a small amount of labor, and that only
the labor of occupation, more than suffices to satisfy the small
demand for them. Here, naturally enough, the price of raw
materials is very low. After this, it rises with every advance
made in civilization, for two reasons: first, because the demand
becomes greater and greater; and then, because the
naturally free sources of production, called into requisition by
other wants, now flow less and less abundantly.<a href="#note_793" id="noteref_793" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">793</span></span></a> This rise in
price continues until the point is reached at which it becomes
customary, instead of the mere occupation of the free gifts of
nature, to bring forth the commodities in question by the more
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page392">[pg 392]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg392"></a>
laborious process of production proper. From this time forward,
the usual seeking of prices for a level requires that our
commodity should, like all others which suppose an equal sacrifice
of the means of production, claim an equal value in exchange.
If from any peculiar causes, the production of this
commodity is not at all possible, or if it is capable of no great
extension, its price, which would under the circumstances, be
limited only by the purchasing power of the buyer, might
attain the utmost extreme reached in prices under the spur of
vanity or of the mere love of the commodity itself. The
latter is true especially in the case of venison;<a href="#note_794" id="noteref_794" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">794</span></span></a> the former,

B. The rise in prices is observed earliest in that class of
goods in question which by reason of their small volume and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page394">[pg 394]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg394"></a>
their comparatively great value, and by reason of the greater
capacity to be kept in a state of preservation for a longer
time, are best adapted to seeking a more favorable market.
This applies particularly to the skins, fleece, hair, feathers,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page395">[pg 395]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg395"></a>
teeth, horns, etc., of animals, in which, in the breeding of stock,
etc. people in a low stage of civilization are much more apt
to speculate than in their meat. Here it is considered, and
rightly so, to be much more profitable to raise many animals
which are badly cared for, than a few, that are well cared for;
for the care bestowed on animals has, as a rule, much more influence
on the body itself than on their covering.<a href="#note_799" id="noteref_799" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">799</span></span></a> In fisheries,

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page397">[pg 397]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg397"></a>
pitch, tar, potash and, to some extent, building material
etc., play the same part.<a href="#note_801" id="noteref_801" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">801</span></span></a>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Conversely, the price of those portions which are most difficult
of transportation, by reason of their volume or of the
difficulty of preserving them, rises latest. To this category
belongs milk, the production of which in a fresh state can be
made an object of economic speculation, only where civilization
is at its very highest, and especially in the vicinity of
large cities.<a href="#note_802" id="noteref_802" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">802</span></span></a>
It is indeed possible by its transformation into
butter or cheese to preserve milk and make it capable of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page398">[pg 398]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg398"></a>
transportation. But to carry on such a business for the purposes
of trade, a care and a cleanliness are needed which are
national characteristics only of a highly civilized people (§ 229),
and the preparation of a superior quality of cheese, which is always
a very long process, is conditioned by the employment
of capital long in advance of a return, and which no poor
nation is in a condition to make.<a href="#note_803" id="noteref_803" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">803</span></span></a> Cows are primarily milk-producing
animals.<a href="#note_804" id="noteref_804" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">804</span></span></a> Hence their price, as a rule, rises later
than that of oxen, but, in the higher stages of civilization, it
rises much more surprisingly. Something analogous is true
of those products which result from what remains after the
production of other goods or commodities. As long as this
alone supplies the demand, the cost of production of the
former commodity is almost nothing, and hence its price is
very low. For this reason hogs are relatively cheap in two
very different periods of a people's national economy, in a very
low stage of civilization where forests are plentiful and they
are fattened on acorns and the nuts of the beech, and also
when they may be considered as a collateral product of some
great industry, such as distilleries and dairy-farming; and
when raised by a numerous, especially a rural population of
small means and laborers, in order to turn to advantage, in
the former instance, the remains of production, and in the latter
of consumption.<a href="#note_805" id="noteref_805" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">805</span></span></a>
Where neither of these two reasons obtains,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page399">[pg 399]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg399"></a>
the price of hogs is wont to increase largely with an advance
in civilization.<a href="#note_806" id="noteref_806" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">806</span></span></a><a href="#note_807" id="noteref_807" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">807</span></span></a><a href="#note_808" id="noteref_808" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">808</span></span></a> (See Roscher, Nationalökonomik

C. Those raw materials which, from the very first, have
been obtained by the means of production properly so called,
maintain a much greater uniformity in price. In the lower
stages of civilization, they are never found permanently in
excess; and as the economy of a people advances, the growing
dearth of natural forces may be more or less counterbalanced
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page401">[pg 401]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg401"></a>
by the greater cheapness of capital and labor. This
is true, especially of wheat. (See § <a class="tei tei-ref pginternal" href="#Section_129">129</a>,
and Roscher, Nationalökonomik des Ackerbaues, p. 43.)<a href="#note_809" id="noteref_809" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">809</span></span></a>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
D. In the case also of those raw materials which are objects
of occupation, and never of real production, as, for instance,
minerals, a progressive public economy, by altering the different
elements of price in an opposite direction, may leave their
price on the whole unchanged. Here, indeed, the discovery
of new and especially of rich natural stores may exert an incalculable
influence; but such <span class="tei tei-q">“accidents”</span> underlie the laws of
human development only to the extent that those ages which
are intellectually most active are those also which are most industrious
and fortunate in the discovery of their natural resources.<a href="#note_810" id="noteref_810" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">810</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
E. The products of industry become cheaper and cheaper
as economic culture advances; whereas, for instance, in England,
towards the end of the middle ages, a single shirt was
considered of importance enough to be made not unfrequently
an object of testamentary bequest.<a href="#note_811" id="noteref_811" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">811</span></span></a> And, indeed, the price of
industrial products sinks lower the more important the part
played in their production by capital and the division of labor
is as compared with the part played by the raw material.<a href="#note_812" id="noteref_812" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">812</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page403">[pg 403]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg403"></a>
On this account, in recent times, fine cloths have grown, relatively
speaking, much cheaper than coarse ones.<a href="#note_813" id="noteref_813" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">813</span></span></a> Lead, which during the middle ages in England was much cheaper
than iron, because of the difficulty of mining the latter, has become
much dearer in our days.<a href="#note_814" id="noteref_814" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">814</span></span></a>
Conversely, where raw
material plays the most important part in manufactures, the
price of the manufactured article may increase with an advance
in civilization. Hence, articles made of wood are procured
at the cheapest rates in mountainous countries, where
the division of labor is not carried very far, but where the
raw material is cheap.<a href="#note_815" id="noteref_815" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">815</span></span></a>

F. But the price of commodities decreases, especially in the
higher stages of civilization, to the extent that it is dependent
on commerce.<a href="#note_816" id="noteref_816" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">816</span></span></a>
Here capital and human labor almost exclusively
are effective, and the modern improvements of communication,
legal security and competition are especially striking.<a href="#note_817" id="noteref_817" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">817</span></span></a>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
G. Since personal services are, as a rule, performed and
received only by individuals, the principle in accordance with
which labor in general becomes cheaper in the higher stages
of civilization, does not apply to them to any great extent.<a href="#note_818" id="noteref_818" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">818</span></span></a> Yet
we may claim that advancing civilization has pretty universally
a twofold influence on the price paid for personal services. In
the first place, freedom of competition, with the more accurate
and equitable determination of price which it produces (in contradistinction
to servitude, privilege and custom) always tends
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page405">[pg 405]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg405"></a>
to obtain the upper hand; and further, by the growing combination
of labor and of use (§§ <a class="tei tei-ref pginternal" href="#Section_56">56</a>, ff. 207), a better and better
and more clearly defined gradation between ordinary services and
those of a higher order is effected. When the latter cannot
be increased at pleasure, the price paid for them may, as the
wealth of consumers increases, become, from motives of vanity
or of custom (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">Gebrauchsgründen</span></span>),
almost unlimited. The dancing maid, to whom Herod (Mark, 6, 23) promised even
the half of his kingdom, is both in a politico-economical and
in a moral sense a warning example to over-refined nations.<a href="#note_819" id="noteref_819" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">819</span></span></a>

Antiquity And In The Middle Ages.</span></h3>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is impossible to write a real history of the values of the
precious metals in ancient and medieval times: the sources of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page406">[pg 406]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg406"></a>
information are too few. But it does seem possible to suggest
some fragments and something of the development of that
history,<a href="#note_820" id="noteref_820" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">820</span></span></a> at least in outline.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus, for instance, the supply of the precious metals furnished
by the mines, in the earlier times of ancient history,
was kept from entering the market by the system which then
prevailed everywhere, of hoarding treasure by the state, by
the temples etc., and later by great reserves of treasure kept by
individuals.<a href="#note_821" id="noteref_821" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">821</span></span></a> The revolutions in prices in ancient times were
produced as frequently by the sudden opening of such reservoirs,
as by the discovery of richer sources. Thus, for instance,
such events as the dissipation of Pericles' treasures, the
subsidies of the Persian kings, the spoliation of many temples
in consequence of declining religiousness, the distribution of
Persian treasures by Alexander the Great,<a href="#note_822" id="noteref_822" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">822</span></span></a> had a vast influence
on the undeniable rise in the price of Greek commodities
in the century succeeding the Peleponnesian war.<a href="#note_823" id="noteref_823" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">823</span></span></a> Later,
it is said that in Rome, the price of pieces of land was doubled
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page407">[pg 407]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg407"></a>
by the influx of Egyptian war-booty.<a href="#note_824" id="noteref_824" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">824</span></span></a> It is a remarkable
proof of the undeveloped condition of trade in the earlier periods
of ancient history, that the perturbations in prices were,
apparently, at least, so entirely local. Phœnicia, Palestine
etc., must have experienced, in the age of Solomon, a formal
deluge of the precious metals, while Greece, for instance, was
then, and for centuries after, extremely poor in them.<a href="#note_825" id="noteref_825" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">825</span></span></a> It is not, on the whole, to be doubted, that the value in exchange
of the precious metals was on a continual decline until the
most flourishing time of the Roman emperors.<a href="#note_826" id="noteref_826" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">826</span></span></a> During the
middle ages, it seems to have stood much higher again; because
the great loss of treasure caused by the migration of
nations etc., the almost complete cessation of production at the
mines, and the slowness of the circulation of money, played
a much more important part than the decrease of trade.<a href="#note_827" id="noteref_827" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">827</span></span></a><a href="#note_828" id="noteref_828" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">828</span></span></a>

precious metals less by the peculiar wealth of the mines in that
part of the world than by their almost incredible number.<a href="#note_829" id="noteref_829" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">829</span></span></a>

The production of the American mines first assumed great importance after
the discovery of Potosi, in 1545, which was soon followed by
the working of the American mines at Guanaxuato. (1558.)
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page409">[pg 409]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg409"></a>
Coincident with this was the extraordinary <span class="tei tei-q">“chance”</span> of
Medina's invention, in 1557; by means of which, it became
possible to separate silver from foreign elements by the cool
process of amalgamation, instead of melting it as had hitherto
been done; an invention all the more important in America,
for the reason that in that country, where there is so much
rich ore, there is scarcely any fuel, in the neighborhood<a href="#note_831" id="noteref_831" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">831</span></span></a> of
where it is found. During the first hundred years the mines
of Peru occupied the most prominent place; whereas they
were afterwards completely overshadowed by the Mexican.<a href="#note_832" id="noteref_832" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">832</span></span></a>

working of the Mexican silver mines of Valencia, Biscaina etc.
from the middle of the same century. In the beginning of the

increased in the previous generation by reason of the greater
liberality of Spanish colonial policy.<a href="#note_837" id="noteref_837" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">837</span></span></a> Since that time,
a certain increase has, indeed, been noticed, which, however,
had not immediately before the discovery of the gold mines of
California by any means attained the height reached in 1808,
but only an annual production of 701,570 kilogrammes of silver,
and of 15,215 kilogrammes of gold, with an aggregate
value of more than 56,000,000 thalers.<a href="#note_838" id="noteref_838" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">838</span></span></a>

In Europe, also, the obtaining of the precious metals during
the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries took a great stride,
especially in Germany;<a href="#note_839" id="noteref_839" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">839</span></span></a> but, on the other hand, the Spanish
gold and silver mines were closed in 1535 by a law. In the
seventeenth century, there was another lull, followed, at the
end of the eighteenth, by a second period of activity which has
not yet closed. The great development of the production of
gold in the Ural mines since 1819, and in the Altai mines since
1829,<a href="#note_840" id="noteref_840" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">840</span></span></a> the revival of the production of silver in the old Spanish

The mere discovery of new and richer mines need not, of
itself, lower the price of the precious metals. Their price depends
on their cost of production; and it may be very much
increased, even under the most favorable natural conditions,
by the unskillfulness of labor, the dearness of the means of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page412">[pg 412]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg412"></a>
subsistence, of machinery and of auxiliary substances, by insecurity

etc. The new mines can produce a decline in the price of the
precious metals only to the extent that, for the same amount
of capital and labor expended, they, spite of all such deductions,
produce a greater result.<a href="#note_846" id="noteref_846" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">846</span></span></a>

I opine that the price of metallic money, since the discovery
of America, has diminished until the present time in the ratio
of from three to four to one.<a href="#note_847" id="noteref_847" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">847</span></span></a> The prices of wheat in France,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page413">[pg 413]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg413"></a>
from 1800 to 1850, were about seven times as great as in the
second half of the fifteenth century; and in England about six
times as great. But, it is not to be overlooked here, how
wheat may have grown dearer in itself (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">an
sich</span></span>) and how gold
declined considerably less than silver. True, this decline of
the precious metals was not an entirely steady one. We meet
at the beginning of the modern era with a real revolution in
prices. The prices of rye, in lower Saxony, from 1525 to
1550, were twice as high as from 1475 to 1500. According
to Garnier, the French prices of wheat, from 1450 to 1500,
were, on an average, 408 francs of the present time per <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">setier</span></span>;
from 1501 to 1520, 5 francs; from 1522 to 1540, 11.26 francs;
from 1541 to 1560, 11.69 francs; from 1561 to 1580, 21.33
francs; from 1581 to 1600, 32.51 francs; during the first half
of the seventeenth century, 22.77 francs; in the second half,
26.83 francs; from 1701 to 1750, 19.64 francs. Similarly in
England, where wheat cost, from 1560 to 1600, 2.64 times as
much as from 1450 to 1500.<a href="#note_848" id="noteref_848" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">848</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now, the increased production of the mines cannot be the
only cause of this great perturbation in prices. It commenced,
in most countries, at a time when the supplies from America
were still too small to account for such an effect. One of the
chief causes of the phenomenon was, that precisely at this period,
there was in so many nations a transition from a sluggish
circulation of money, made still more sluggish by the custom
which everywhere prevailed of hoarding treasure, to a rapid
circulation, which was made still more rapid by the use of all kinds of substitutes for
money. (§ <a class="tei tei-ref pginternal" href="#Section_123">123</a>).<a href="#note_849" id="noteref_849" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">849</span></span></a> In the earliest ripe
fruit of European civilization (Italy), this transition had long
been accomplished; and, on that account, the value in exchange
of the precious metals was there, for a long time previous,
comparatively low.<a href="#note_850" id="noteref_850" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">850</span></span></a>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From the second third of the seventeenth century, the value
of the medium of circulation seems, on the whole, to have remained
stationary.<a href="#note_851" id="noteref_851" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">851</span></span></a> Tooke seeks to demonstrate the steady
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page415">[pg 415]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg415"></a>
decline of the value of money until late in the eighteenth century,
from the fact that the wages of labor increased during
that time; but I should rather connect the latter phenomenon
with the simultaneous elevation of the classes engaged in
manual labor. And so Adam Smith infers a rise in the price
of money after the beginning of the eighteenth century, from
the prices of wheat;<a href="#note_852" id="noteref_852" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">852</span></span></a>
but it would be better to consider the
cause of this to be the unusually long series of good crops.<a href="#note_853" id="noteref_853" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">853</span></span></a>
An equally unusually long series of bad harvests, during the
second half of the century, accounts satisfactorily for the simultaneous
rise of the medium prices of corn. The great war
which lasted from 1793 to 1815, too, according to a very
prevalent opinion, must have caused the value of money to
decline; a fact which is generally accredited to the increase
of paper money in so many states.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Every great war may very easily have for effect to slacken
the speed of the circulation of money, to promote the hoarding
and even the burial of treasure for a rainy day, and to paralyze
credit and its power to supply the place of money.
Hence, it seems preferable to seek for the cause of the variations
in price, during the great war, in the commodities themselves
whose price was affected; since their production must
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page416">[pg 416]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg416"></a>
have been enormously disturbed. It rendered the brawniest
men and the most powerful horses unproductive, and even
employed them as agents of destruction. It interrupted trade
in a thousand ways, or drove it into unnatural channels, and
turned the intellectual interests of nations into every direction
save that of economic industry. To this must be added the
absence of security everywhere.<a href="#note_854" id="noteref_854" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">854</span></span></a>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The cessation of these restrictions upon production, in consequence
of the restoration of peace throughout the world and
the great progress afterwards made in almost all branches of
industry, explain why, from 1818 to 1848, the precious metals
have apparently stood higher than during the period immediately
preceding.<a href="#note_855" id="noteref_855" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">855</span></span></a><a href="#note_856" id="noteref_856" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">856</span></span></a>

Use Of Gold And Silver.</span></h3>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To understand why so great an increase in the production
of the precious metals produced so small a decline of their
value in exchange, we must turn our attention to the other
and further uses of gold and silver. The amount devoted to
these uses can never be very accurately determined, since
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page417">[pg 417]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg417"></a>
governmental stamping of every new gold or silver article
would afford no evidence as to the number of such articles
manufactured out of old articles etc.<a href="#note_857" id="noteref_857" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">857</span></span></a> Certain it is, however,
that the aggregate amount of gold and silver thus employed,
increases with the increase of luxury and wealth among modern
nations, and that a quantity of the precious metals thus
used, especially when used for purposes of gilding for instance,
is irrestorably lost.<a href="#note_858" id="noteref_858" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">858</span></span></a> In addition to this, there is the wear and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page418">[pg 418]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg418"></a>
tear of coin in circulation, which is naturally greater in the case
of large pieces than of small, and, therefore, in the case of
silver than of gold. There is, further, the damage caused by
the loss of coin in conflagrations and shipwrecks, and that
occasioned by buried and forgotten treasure.<a href="#note_859" id="noteref_859" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">859</span></span></a>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But, lastly, the principal cause consists in the powerful increase
of the demand for money, which, during the last two
centuries, the great impulse given to the rapidity of circulation,
and the great increase in the substitutes for money, have
scarcely been able to outweigh. Besides the great growth
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page419">[pg 419]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg419"></a>
of population and of wealth, at least in Europe and the new
world, I need call attention only to the immense advance made
in the division of labor, and to the transition from trade by
barter to trade through the instrumentality of money. The
entire war and merchant marine of England, about 1602, had,
according to Anderson, a capacity of only 45,000 tons,—that
is, not one-fifth of what the small city of Bremen has now; a
capacity which at the close of the year 1873 amounted to
237,206 tons—while in 1872 its merchant marine alone had
a capacity of 7,213,000 tons. The aggregate foreign trade
of England, France, Russia and the United States, in 1750,
amounted to about 260,000,000 thalers; in 1864, it was over
5,400,000,000, and between 1871 and 1872, in one year,
over 9,000,000,000 thalers. Nor should it be forgotten that
Europe's trade with the East, since the beginning of the sixteenth
century, increased immensely. This, at present, produces
uniformly a very <span class="tei tei-q">“unfavorable balance”</span> for Europe,
which can be made up for only by very large shipments of
silver to foreign parts.<a href="#note_860" id="noteref_860" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">860</span></span></a> If China and India were suddenly to

the result would be a great revolution in prices in Europe.

Tengoborski is of opinion, that the flow of gold from Siberia
alone would have been absorbed by the ever-increasing
want of civilized nations of money; but that the coincident discoveries
in California and Australia, in September 1847, and
February 1851, must sooner or later produce a revolution in
prices. And, indeed, the fecundity of these countries is unparalleled.
North America, which in 1846 produced only
3,600 pounds of gold, according to Sœtbeer, produced in the
years from 1849 to 1863, respectively, 118,000, 148,000, 178,000,
195,000, 180,000, 165,000, 165,000, 165,000, 160,000, 145,000,
125,000, 120,000, 115,000 and 110,000. Austria produced in

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From 1864 to 1867, the aggregate production of gold in the
world was, according to the last mentioned authority, a yearly
average of 188.4 millions of thalers, and of silver, 94.8 millions.
In Europe, Russia not included, the production was, in 1863,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page421">[pg 421]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg421"></a>
3,960 pounds of gold and 405,000 pounds of silver; in the

1868-1870, annually, 192.8 million thalers of gold, and 94 million
thalers of silver; and in 1873, of both metals, 291 million
thalers.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The question, whether in this second half of the nineteenth
century, we are to have a revolution in prices similar to that
which took place in the sixteenth century can be answered
only hypothetically. The gold diggings now most productive
will, probably, as we may judge from analogous cases in the
past, be soon exhausted.<a href="#note_863" id="noteref_863" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">863</span></span></a> But it is entirely possible that, for
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page423">[pg 423]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg423"></a>
a long series of years, other diggings will be found equally
rich. It is almost certain that the restless activity of the English
and of North Americans will not cease until they have
exhausted the favors of nature.<a href="#note_864" id="noteref_864" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">864</span></span></a> Every improvement in agriculture,
in the means of communication, and in the public security
of the gold lands, makes the cost of production smaller.
There are doubtless in other countries a great many <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">placers</span></span>
which need only to be touched with the finger of European
civilization to produce gold in abundance.<a href="#note_865" id="noteref_865" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">865</span></span></a>
It would, indeed,
be necessary that this same civilization should make these
same countries better markets for the precious metals by increasing
their demand.
</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page424">[pg 424]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg424"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
So far as silver is concerned, there can be no question that
America possesses mines unlimited in extent, and, as yet,
almost untouched. <span class="tei tei-q">“The time will come,”</span> says Duport,<a href="#note_866" id="noteref_866" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">866</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“a
century sooner or later, when the production of silver will
have no other limits than those put to it by the continual
decline in the price of silver.”</span> There seems, also, to be no
lack of quicksilver, especially in California; and the cost of
its production hitherto may be lessened very much by the
labor of better workmen, machines and means of transportation.<a href="#note_867" id="noteref_867" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">867</span></span></a>
All this supposes great progress of the mining countries
in civilization in general; and yet, thus far, Mexico's republican
independence etc., as compared with the later years of the
Spanish colonial system there, is a great retrogression. The
conquest of Spanish America by the United States would
give a vast impetus to economic improvement; and here,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page425">[pg 425]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg425"></a>
again, the increase of production would be attended by an increased
demand.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But especially must the demand for the precious metals,
which naturally increases with the wealth, commerce and luxury
of nations, constitute a decisive element in answering our
question. Nothing, for instance, were a reduction in prices
impending, would promote it so much as a series of devastating
wars or revolutions in Europe. Moreover, it should not
be forgotten, that the money market is now almost commensurable
with the world, and will soon embrace it within its
limits; and that market embraces not only the precious metals
but the numberless representatives of money and media of
credit. The basin, therefore, to which the gold and silver
streams of the world are tributary is immeasurably greater
than it was in the sixteenth century; its level cannot be changed
as readily, and an equal addition made every year to its previous contents can
increase it only by a small amount.<a href="#note_868" id="noteref_868" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">868</span></span></a> Nor
could a considerable decline of the value of the precious metals
be readily produced without making the circulation of
money slower, and the employment of means of credit relatively
less frequent, in consequence of which, the further decline
would, to a certain extent, be arrested.<a href="#note_869" id="noteref_869" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">869</span></span></a> In the case of
other commodities a decline of prices leads only probably to
an absolutely greater demand; in the case of money, it leads
to a demand necessarily greater. That the money market in
our days can stand pretty rude shocks is evident from the
fact, among others, that the price of gold is so high as compared
with that of silver.<a href="#note_870" id="noteref_870" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">870</span></span></a><a href="#note_871" id="noteref_871" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">871</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The ulterior consequences of such a revolution in prices
would contribute to the real wealth of a people only in the
sense that they would place such a people in a way, with less
sacrifice, to employ the precious metals on a large scale in ministering
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page427">[pg 427]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg427"></a>
to the luxuries of life. This small advantage itself
would be counterbalanced by the depreciation of the metallic
stock, and especially by the necessity of henceforth devoting a larger quantity
of gold and silver to the purposes of circulation.<a href="#note_872" id="noteref_872" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">872</span></span></a>
But such a revolution would produce a sudden reverse
in the distribution of a nation's wealth among its constituent
members. All those who, by virtue of contracts antecedently
made, have payments to effect, are benefited to the extent of the difference between
the old and the actual price, while those who are to receive such payments
lose to the same extent.<a href="#note_873" id="noteref_873" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">873</span></span></a>
Therefore, those engaged in industrial enterprises improve
their condition, because they immediately increase<a href="#note_874" id="noteref_874" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">874</span></span></a> the prices

Besides, at the beginning, and before a corresponding depreciation
of its value has taken place, an increase of money
produces as a rule a low rate of interest (§ 185), and an itch to
buy on the part of the public. All this may serve as a powerful
stimulant to production on a large scale.<a href="#note_876" id="noteref_876" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">876</span></span></a> Those most

annuitants, creditors of the nation and of individuals.

which they see disappearing, so to speak under their eyes.<a href="#note_878" id="noteref_878" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">878</span></span></a>

fixed sums to be paid at regular intervals, that is, in a great

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The condition of those who earned a living by manual labor
no doubt deteriorated in the sixteenth century, as may be inferred
from the extraordinary activity of public charity in
that period.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Between 1500 and 1550, silver purchased, in Orleans, from
4.1 to 4.5 times as much common labor as it does now, while
silver, as compared with the average price of twenty-seven
commodities, has grown cheaper in the ratio of only from 2.6
to 2.7:1. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mantellier.</span></span>) It was impossible for this class to
raise the price of their wares as rapidly as that of the medium
of circulation declined, because they could not wait, nor hold
back their commodity even for a moment. (§ 164.)<a href="#note_880" id="noteref_880" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">880</span></span></a> This
would, indeed, be very different in our day. Wages, because
of the facilities, both physical and moral, which have everywhere
been placed in the way of emigration, were necessarily
one of these articles which rose soonest in price, as compared
with money.<a href="#note_881" id="noteref_881" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">881</span></span></a>
Lastly, the state itself profits by the diminished
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page430">[pg 430]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg430"></a>
thing-value, that is, real value of its public debt;<a href="#note_882" id="noteref_882" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">882</span></span></a> but it loses,
at the same time, on all taxes, duties etc., which are not estimated
at a certain percentage of the value of the articles
taxed.<a href="#note_883" id="noteref_883" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">883</span></span></a>
As a rule, therefore, it would need to impose new
taxes. Now, the parliamentary right to impose taxes, however
extensive it may juridically be, is, ordinarily, of great
importance in practice only when there is question of increasing
the existing burthen. Hence, this right, wherever it exists,
is brought into the utmost activity by a revolution in
prices.<a href="#note_884" id="noteref_884" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">884</span></span></a><a href="#note_885" id="noteref_885" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">885</span></span></a>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
However, the new additions of gold and silver to the already
existing supply may not immediately produce a corresponding
depreciation of the value of the precious metals. If the
first receivers of the additional supply of money exchange it
rapidly for other goods, it will probably bring them the former
value in exchange of the metal. Not until it has passed into
a third or fourth person's hands is the depreciation apt to be
perceptible. It is, therefore, in this case, a great advantage to
be the first hand. The world-threatening power of Spain, in
the seventeenth century, was very essentially promoted by the
American gold and silver mines;<a href="#note_886" id="noteref_886" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">886</span></span></a> nor is it a matter of less
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page431">[pg 431]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg431"></a>
significance to-day, that the great mineral wealth of the world
belongs to Siberia, California and Australia; that is, especially
to Russia and to countries colonized by Great Britain. Further,
as to the classes into which a nation is divided, it was
only the crown, the Church and a comparatively small number of officials,
soldiers and officers who controlled Spanish America;<a href="#note_887" id="noteref_887" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">887</span></span></a>
and who can tell how the absolute monarchy of Spain
was strengthened by this fact? In the seventeenth century,
on the other hand, it is principally manufacturers and merchants,
and more especially yet, workmen, who reap the immediate
advantages of new discoveries of gold.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A great enhancement of the precious metals would naturally and
necessarily produce a revolution in prices in a direction<a href="#note_888" id="noteref_888" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">888</span></span></a>
opposite to the one just described, and one which would be
much more injurious to a nation's economy. Such a revolution
would weigh most heavily on the most sensitive, and the
momentarily most productive classes of the people, inasmuch
as the price of the ready product as compared with advances
made for the purposes of production would be a declining one;
and it would benefit those classes who live in leisure on the
fruits of previous labor. There would, at the same time, be
a perceptible growth of consumption in certain departments,
useful, no doubt, in themselves, but apt to degenerate into excess,
and which are, therefore, most easily cared for. (§ 212, seq.)
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page432">[pg 432]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg432"></a>
To this extent, the gold discoveries of the nineteenth century,
without which an enhancement of the price of money would
undoubtedly have taken place, have warded off a great economic
malady from the nations. Moreover, this inverted revolution
in prices may be moderated by governmental measures, such as a diminution
of taxes, emissions of paper money etc.<a href="#note_889" id="noteref_889" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">889</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The price of gold as compared with that of silver does not,
by any means, depend entirely on the ratio of the quantities of
the two to each other. Rather is it, in the long run, determined
by the average cost of production necessary at those
gold and silver mines which exist under the most disadvantageous
conditions, but which it is still necessary to work in
order to satisfy the aggregate requirement of these metals.
On the whole, with an advance of economic civilization, the
dearness of gold as compared with that of silver has been enhanced.
The former, in the middle ages, was worth from ten to
twelve times as much as the latter,<a href="#note_890" id="noteref_890" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">890</span></span></a> while now it is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page433">[pg 433]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg433"></a>
worth from fifteen to almost sixteen times as much.<a href="#note_891" id="noteref_891" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">891</span></span></a> In the
same period of time, also, gold in highly civilized countries
is wont to be comparatively dearer.<a href="#note_892" id="noteref_892" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">892</span></span></a>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These facts are explained as well by the demand as by the
supply. As the production of gold requires so little skill or
capital, and that of silver so much of both, the former may be
considered a natural product to a greater extent than the latter,
and therefore, the rule laid down in § <a class="tei tei-ref pginternal" href="#Section_130">130</a> is
applicable to it. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Senior.</span></span>) Besides, in the higher stages of
civilization, especially when the precious metals are cheap, larger payments
are usual, to the making of which, gold is certainly best
adapted; just as in every day trade merchants are wont to
accept a gold piece in payment, even at something of a premium,
while the peasantry hesitate to do so.<a href="#note_893" id="noteref_893" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">893</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is very much of a question whether gold or silver is, on
the whole, subject to greater variations in price. The fact
that gold is more strictly a natural product would of itself
constitute a powerful element of variation. (§ <a class="tei tei-ref pginternal" href="#Section_112">112</a>).
But, on the other hand, its greater durability and the greater care bestowed
on its preservation, have for effect to make the existing
quantity preponderate in importance over its annual increase.
The demand for gold varies more suddenly than
the demand for silver. In case of war or sedition, the former
is more easily carried away or hidden. It is also more desirable
for the state for its military fund. On the other hand, on
account of its greater capacity for transportation, it may follow
such claims when made on it, more easily, from country
to country. On the whole, I am inclined to think that, for
short periods of time, silver maintains its value better, and
gold for longer ones.<a href="#note_894" id="noteref_894" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">894</span></span></a>

a notable depression of the value of that metal, it becomes a
question whether or not silver would be necessarily depreciated
with it. Senior claims that it would not, for the reason
that the two precious metals do not, for most purposes, act as
substitutes each of the other. If a country needed 1,000 pounds of gold and
15,000 pounds of silver as money,<a href="#note_896" id="noteref_896" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">896</span></span></a> and these
two sums of metal were equal in value, an increase of gold by
one-half, which would depreciate its price in relation to silver
to 10:1, would not overflow the channels of circulation. The
1,500 pounds of gold are now also equal to only 15,000 pounds
of silver, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vice versa</span></span>.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I would put very important limitations to this assertion.
Even a moderate depreciation of gold would drive out the
silver from all those countries which had a mixed coinage
made up of the two metals; and hence the supply of silver
would be increased in the other countries. And so it is quite
possible, up to a certain point, that the larger silver coin should
be replaced by small gold ones, ten and five franc pieces etc.
Rau is certainly right in his surmise that a general rise in the
price of commodities as compared with coin, the result of a
great increase of gold, would go farthest in countries in which
the gold is the medium of circulation, begin later in those
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page436">[pg 436]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg436"></a>

well for purposes of counting as for purposes of the storing
up of values and for transmission from place to place; a matter
of greater importance in proportion to the badness of a country's
means of transportation, and to the cheapness of the metal
of its currency hitherto.<a href="#note_910" id="noteref_910" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">910</span></span></a> It seems a still more important matter
to most people that paper money dispenses with the use of a
great quantity of the precious metals for purposes of circulation,
which can now either be turned into utensils, etc. in the
country itself or used in foreign countries to make investments
of capital there, or in the purchase of commodities.<a href="#note_911" id="noteref_911" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">911</span></span></a> In national
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page444">[pg 444]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg444"></a>
economies whose commerce is a growing one, the same
advantage finds a negative expression in this, that they are not
compelled to satisfy the increasing demand for money by procuring
costly metals.<a href="#note_912" id="noteref_912" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">912</span></span></a> Of the individual members of the nation,
all these advantages of convenience will be experienced
by those who employ the paper money. The economical or
saving advantages of paper money are appropriated by the
issuers to themselves, in the form of a non-interest bearing
loan, which they make to those owners of money or to those
who are entitled to a money-claim and to whom the paper
money is acceptable instead of cash money.<a href="#note_913" id="noteref_913" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">913</span></span></a> A diminution
for instance of the number of bank notes or of state paper
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page445">[pg 445]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg445"></a>
money does not diminish the available capital of the people.
Its only effect is that a smaller portion of it is at the disposal
of the bank or of the government.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But in contrast with these advantages are the great disadvantages,
since paper money is wanting in most of those
properties which originally made the precious metals the best
instruments of exchange and the best measures of value. In
addition to this, paper money may be increased at pleasure,
and at almost no cost; and an occasional surplus of it cannot
flow either into other branches of employment (as a surplus of
metallic money may into utensils, ornamentation, etc.) nor into
other countries. And thus the constancy of value of paper
money, that is, one of the chief requisites of all good money, is
imperiled in the highest degree. True, the payment-power,
or <span class="tei tei-q">“legal tender”</span> character given such money by the state
may certainly supplement in some way its matter and form-value.
But this supplement or addition constitutes, in the case
of large amounts<a href="#note_914" id="noteref_914" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">914</span></span></a>
a small quota; or else the quantity of money
as compared with the amount of money needed for commerce
would have to be fixed very accurately; a thing of peculiar
difficulty in the case of paper money, which is almost costless.<a href="#note_915" id="noteref_915" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">915</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
While precious metal money carries, so to speak, by far the
greater portion of its value in itself, and this to such an extent
that it appears on the inscription found on its face, the inscription
found on paper money is almost the only reason of its
value.<a href="#note_916" id="noteref_916" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">916</span></span></a> (Credit-value.) The issuer promises in one form or another,
expressly or tacitly, that he intends to redeem the note,
almost valueless in itself, in real goods; and the value of this
promise depends on the probability of its fulfillment.<a href="#note_917" id="noteref_917" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">917</span></span></a> The
only fully satisfactory kind of redemption consists in this, that
every holder of the paper money may, immediately on demand,
obtain its nominal value in good current metallic money.
This only can, in the long run, keep paper money up to its full
nominal value. But experience teaches that even with less perfect
modes of redemption, paper money may maintain a part of
its nominal value, and a part greater in proportion as the following
conditions are approximated to: freedom from personal
considerations, the immediateness of the redemption, and currency
of the goods by means of which redemption is effected.
Thus, for instance, the acceptance of paper money for all debts
due the state, in countries where taxation is heavy, where
there are large state industries etc.; where the lands of the
state are farmed out etc., has a great influence on its course of
exchange. Redemption in parcels of land is a very imperfect
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page447">[pg 447]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg447"></a>
one, not only on account of the great differences in the value
of pieces of land according to quality, situation, the times etc.,
but also because only a very small number of men, especially
where money is the usual medium of exchange, are in a condition
to accept parcels of land.<a href="#note_918" id="noteref_918" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">918</span></span></a> It is a question whether the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page448">[pg 448]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg448"></a>
threat of punishing the refusal to accept paper money, or to
accept it at its full nominal value, can be called a negative
mode of redemption. Certain it is, however, that it is the
most barbarous and in the long run the least efficient mode,
one in which the issuer calculates only on the fear of those
who accept it; and, what is most demoralizing, on the hope
they entertain that they in turn shall be able to dispose of it
to others as timid.<a href="#note_919" id="noteref_919" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">919</span></span></a><a href="#note_920" id="noteref_920" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">920</span></span></a>

When paper money which is not completely redeemable—and
it is scarcely possible that in the long run it should be
thus redeemable—has sunk below its nominal value, the result
in the case of all private paper money is the bankruptcy (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">Vermögensbruch</span></span>) of the individual issuing it; in the
case of state paper money, the legal provision that it shall have a compulsory
circulation (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">Zwangcourse</span></span>;
<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">cours forcé</span></span>).<a href="#note_921" id="noteref_921" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">921</span></span></a> To what extent

the real rate of exchange of paper money shall fall in any
case depends not only on the amount issued as compared with
the wants of trade, but also and still more on the degree of confidence
which the state of public affairs inspires.<a href="#note_922" id="noteref_922" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">922</span></span></a> The first
consequence attending a depreciated currency is, that the good
precious metal money is withdrawn from circulation and even
from the country; for the reason that it cannot maintain its
true value side by side with the paper money; the usual effect
in all untenable mixed standards or currencies.<a href="#note_923" id="noteref_923" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">923</span></span></a> A second, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page451">[pg 451]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg451"></a>
worse consequence is the unrightful revolution produced in so
many income and property relations, based on old contracts, to
the advantage of the debtor, to the disadvantage of the creditor,
and of those who receive nominally fixed salaries.<a href="#note_924" id="noteref_924" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">924</span></span></a> These consequences are in kind similar to those produced by the clipping
of the coin; but in degree they are much more dangerous.<a href="#note_925" id="noteref_925" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">925</span></span></a>
Besides, the depreciation of paper produces, by no
means, an equal rise in the prices of all commodities. The
prices of those commodities, the sellers of which are most
favorably situated in the struggle for prices, rise earliest and
highest. This is true especially of foreign commodities, also
of those inland commodities which can be easily exported,
and most particularly of those commodities which have the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page452">[pg 452]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg452"></a>
greatest capacity for circulation, for instance, gold and
silver.<a href="#note_926" id="noteref_926" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">926</span></span></a>
Hence, it would be a great mistake in countries where there
is an irredeemable paper currency with compulsory circulation,
to measure its purchasing power at a special discount as
compared with the precious metals. Therefore, a depreciated
paper currency has transitorily an effect on industry similar to
that of a protective tariff, and even as the payment of export
premiums; inasmuch as it enables manufacturers to permit a
part of their cost of production, viz.: that which they have to
pay their workmen, their older creditors, and in part, also,
their furnishers of raw material, to rise in a less degree than
the paper money has declined in value.<a href="#note_927" id="noteref_927" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">927</span></span></a> This is indeed a very
inequitable advantage accorded to private individuals in the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page453">[pg 453]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg453"></a>
face of the universal distress of the country.<a href="#note_928" id="noteref_928" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">928</span></span></a><a href="#note_929" id="noteref_929" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">929</span></span></a> And these bad
consequences are aggravated by the downward-path principle
which a depreciated paper money always involves. The
state whose financial distress introduced the evil, sees a great
portion of its revenues melt away before its eyes;<a href="#note_930" id="noteref_930" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">930</span></span></a> while in
what concerns its outlay, nothing is more calculated to mislead
it than such an imagined creation out of nothing. And a
thing which greatly contributes to this its the frightful sensitiveness
of a depreciated paper currency in the presence of
complications of foreign politics, a quality which may cause
the government as many inconveniences from without as the issue of its paper money
produced conveniences to it at home.<a href="#note_931" id="noteref_931" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">931</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page454">[pg 454]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg454"></a>
Hence recourse is had to additional issues of paper, which are
easily increased in the same measure as the rate of exchange
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cours</span></span>) has declined.<a href="#note_932" id="noteref_932" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">932</span></span></a> Great private interests operate in the
same direction. Between the increase of the volume of the
paper currency in circulation and its consequent depreciation,
some time always elapses; and in the mean time, either the
purchasing power of the money-owner or his loaning capital
is really greater than before. The former increases the demand
for commodities, the latter facilitates their coming into
existence. However, the flight of speculation with which the
increase of paper money is wont to be accompanied<a href="#note_933" id="noteref_933" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">933</span></span></a> in the
beginning depends on an error shared by many men as to its
true value. Hence it does not last long, and the critical shriveling
up of the inflated bubbles is greater in proportion to
what the previous dimensions of these bubbles were. And
now many believe that the nation's business or economy
might be kept on its course by new emissions of paper money;
and the wise ones hope, at least, to be able thereby to postpone
the catastrophe long enough to enable themselves to get
their property into a safe condition. And in fact, the restoration
of a depreciated currency is accompanied by crises entirely
similar to those which followed its first decline; only
they are in an opposite direction.<a href="#note_934" id="noteref_934" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">934</span></span></a> And hence conscientious
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page455">[pg 455]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg455"></a>
statesmen are frequently deterred from seeking to effect such
a restoration. Yet the darkest side of a paper currency severed
of due connection with precious metal-money consists in
the frequent and violent fluctuations of value to which it is
subject.<a href="#note_935" id="noteref_935" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">935</span></span></a> The consequence of these fluctuations is, that
every commercial transaction, every credit-transaction, and
even every act of saving, in which money plays any part, is
made to bear the impress of a game of chance;<a href="#note_936" id="noteref_936" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">936</span></span></a> a consequence
of far and deep reaching influence, especially in the
higher stages of civilization, where the importance of commerce,
of the credit-system, and of money-economy as contradistinguished
from barter-economy is so great; producing
there a state of uncertainty which is otherwise peculiar only
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page456">[pg 456]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg456"></a>
to barbarous medieval times.<a href="#note_937" id="noteref_937" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">937</span></span></a> All this
discourages the best business men and the best husbandmen more than it does
any other class of people, and demoralizes the whole economy
of a nation; and demoralizes it the more in proportion as it is
easier for the state to influence the value of paper money as
compared with specie, and as its influence is more irresistible.<a href="#note_938" id="noteref_938" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">938</span></span></a>
The compulsory circulation of paper money is a much more
powerful and yet a much more simple screw by means of
which to practice extortion than is the most burdensome taxation
or forced loan, and at the same time the most comprehensive
power which a government can possess to carry out
both these measures. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ad. Wagner.</span></span>)

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The healing of such a paper-money disease as we have described,
it has been endeavored to effect in three ways more
particularly.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A. By the reduction or bringing back of the depreciated
paper money to its full nominal value. And this is best done
by gradually drawing paper money into the state treasury by
means of taxation or by loans, and refusing to allow such paper
money to be again issued. The consequent rise in the
rate at which the outstanding paper money notes exchange
against specie is produced not only by the diminution of the
quantity of paper in circulation, but also by the increasing
confidence in the future which such a governmental measure
inspires.<a href="#note_939" id="noteref_939" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">939</span></span></a> While this mode of procedure has in the abstract
most in its favor, yet it is not to be recommended in practice
except where the depreciation of paper money has either not
gone very far or where it has existed only a short time.<a href="#note_940" id="noteref_940" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">940</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page458">[pg 458]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg458"></a>
Otherwise the revolution in all property-relations and the disturbance
of all rightful speculation—always dangerous and
easily abused—produced by the depreciation would be repeated
by the restoration of values, with this difference only
that the disturbance would be produced the second time in an
opposite direction. And that those who were previously injured
should now be compensated for the damage sustained in
the first instance is impossible in proportion as the depreciation
has been of longer duration. Many of the sufferers from the
effects of depreciation are now compelled, even as tax-payers,
to contribute to the enrichment of the speculators who have
accumulated the depreciated paper into their own hands.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
B. The extreme opposite of such a course would consist in
this, that the depreciated paper should be allowed to go on
sinking lower and lower until it was practically worthless,
whereupon a new currency, whether of metal or paper,
would have to appear like a new world after the waters of a
deluge had been abated. Hence, therefore, one of two things:
universal bankruptcy entered into with the clearest purpose,
or the resignation of despair!<a href="#note_941" id="noteref_941" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">941</span></span></a>
</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page459">[pg 459]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg459"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
C. The middle course between these two has, therefore, been
most frequently pursued, viz.: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the legal reduction</span></span> of the value of
the coin (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">gesetzliche Devalvirung</span></span>),
which consists in reducing
the nominal value of paper money to its current value at the
moment the law goes into force, and by redeeming it either in
specie or in other paper to be issued in smaller quantities.<a href="#note_942" id="noteref_942" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">942</span></span></a> Although
this has been not seldom based on the false principle
that the value of every separate amount of money is inversely
as the aggregate amount of all the money in circulation; yet
it cannot be questioned that it is only the open declaration of
the state bankruptcy which the whole measure involves, and
which in most instances has already happened beyond repair.
Here there is no new and dangerous disturbance of the nation's
economy whatever; and the fluctuations of value in the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page460">[pg 460]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg460"></a>
future which are inseparable from the gradual contraction of
the volume of paper, continued until it has reached its nominal
value, are avoided: this last, of course, only on the supposition
that either the pure metallic or the redeemable paper
currency is rigidly adhered to.<a href="#note_943" id="noteref_943" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">943</span></span></a> But the problem, how to protect
both parties<a href="#note_944" id="noteref_944" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">944</span></span></a> to contracts entered into at a rate of
the currency different from that under which they are to be performed,
from all damage, is one which will never be perfectly solved.
Hence, of the different measures to economically preserve a
state in cases of extraordinary need, the emission of paper
money with compulsory circulation is much more universally
disastrous to the people than the effecting of loans at the very
highest rate of interest, and even than being in arrears in the
matter of paying the officials and creditors of the state.<a href="#note_945" id="noteref_945" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">945</span></span></a>

abuse produces, it is easy to conceive why so many political
economists have expressed such serious doubts as to whether,
on the whole, the invention of paper money has been more of
a curse or of a blessing to mankind. The controversy is
an idle one to a certain extent, since no mature nation (or individual),
and no nation which considers itself mature will renounce
the possibility of a brilliant growth simply because it
fears that it may not be able to withstand the temptations to dangerous
abuse connected therewith. Politically, the best safeguard
against such temptation is a so-called moderate constitution,
which compels the supreme power in the state by
wise and appropriate counterweights, to allow all rightful interests
to assert themselves, or at least to find expression;
and itself to make use not only of the most skillful but also of
the most highly esteemed instruments and measures. Such
a constitution, indeed, cannot be made; it must be the ripe
fruit of a long continued and well conducted national life.<a href="#note_947" id="noteref_947" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">947</span></span></a>
Of the extremes of forms of government, unlimited monarchy
and democracy are about equally exposed to the paper-money
disease.<a href="#note_948" id="noteref_948" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">948</span></span></a> Aristocracies are less exposed to it,
for the reason that from their very nature they eschew centralization; and the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page463">[pg 463]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg463"></a>
paper-money system is intimately connected with the latter.
Nothing so strengthens the central authority as the paper-prerogative
with an unlimited power over the prices of all commodities;
and, on the other hand, whenever paper money is to have a wide
field for action, there is supposed<a href="#note_949" id="noteref_949" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">949</span></span></a> a far-reaching
and intimate interwearing of the different members of the
nation's economy with one another. And in what concerns
the various economic stages, paper money is far removed from
all medieval times; and for the same reasons that make external
commerce here preponderant and condense all commerce into
caravans, staple-towns, fairs, and recommend the collection of
treasure etc.<a href="#note_950" id="noteref_950" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">950</span></span></a>
Later, on the other hand, we find two stages
especially adapted to paper money. We have first, as yet undeveloped
but intellectually active (and therefore desirous of progress) colonial countries,
possessed in abundance of natural means of production without however
being able to concentrate them into the hands of an undertaker
(<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">Unternehmer</span></span>) for
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page464">[pg 464]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg464"></a>
want of money.<a href="#note_951" id="noteref_951" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">951</span></span></a> Here both the saving of the precious
metals and the facilitation of transportation effected by means of
paper money are of greatest utility. And then we have very
highly developed and rich countries; not only because their
economic popular education may protect them against the
dangers of paper money, but because the rich man has relatively
least need of money and may dispense with stores of
specie most readily, because of his influence over the supply
of others.<a href="#note_952" id="noteref_952" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">952</span></span></a>

one of his latest productions (Ueber die sogennante historische und
nicht historische Rechtsschule, Archives du Droit Civil, Heidelberg, XXI
1838) the veteran of the philosophical school, resuming a debate begun a quarter
of a century before, energetically defends himself against the erroneous interpretations
which it was sought to give to his thoughts. <span class="tei tei-q">“Does it follow,”</span>
he inquires, <span class="tei tei-q">“that because a man is desirous of reform, he must surrender
the study of the past? And if there be new laws to construe, how could his
evil genius deter him from the necessary knowledge of ancient laws? Is
there a single jurisconsult, who, in the hope of a better future, despises the
meaning and spirit of that which still exists? I do not know even one....
And when I am accused of passing by the institutions of the past with coldness
and hatred in my heart, because I was one of the first to express the
hope of a better future, a charge is laid at my door which is perfectly
incomprehensible ... I am reproached with despising the history of law. It
is a slander on me. Although I have only laughed at these reports, one
man's mistake grieved me; for that man's name was Niebuhr.... When
he [Niebuhr] returned from Italy to devote himself entirely to science, in
his retreat at Bonn, he passed through Heidelberg, where he remained five
or six days. During a great part of that time we came frequently together.
He was at first a little cold; but Cicero made us friends. After a happy
word let drop concerning that writer, he asked me what I thought of him.
I answered laconically: <span class="tei tei-q">‘If they were burning all the Latin authors, and
I were permitted to grant a pardon to one of them, I should say, without
hesitation: Spare the works of Cicero.’</span> He joyfully exclaimed: <span class="tei tei-q">‘I have
at last found a man who judges rightly of Cicero. I share your admiration
for him, and that is the reason I have given my boy the name of Marcus.’</span>
The ice was now broken, and he frankly told me that he could not understand
how I could be an inveterate enemy of Roman law and of the history
of law. I gave him to understand that I had simply been slandered, and I
added, that, in order to live entirely with the classics, I had always refused
to give legal advice, or act as a counsellor, although I might have made a
fortune in that way. I told him that I owed my gayety and vigor, in great
part, to my love for the classics of all ages, even those outside the domain
of jurisprudence; but that I held, above all things, to the good qualities of
the German nation, and that I did not hesitate to say with Facciolatus:
<span class="tei tei-q">‘Expedit omnes gentes Romanis legibus operam dare, suis vivere.’</span></span>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“When he heard those words of mine, he exclaimed with his usual energy
and vivacity: <span class="tei tei-q">‘Habes me consentientem, labes me consentientem.’</span> From
that moment all coldness between us was at an end, and we approached,
without any embarrassment, a host of questions in one conversation in
which I endeavored, as I had before, to learn from him.</span>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Thus I receive with sincere gratitude, all the works, both useful and profound,
which have appeared in our day on the history of law. It would be
folly in me to deny the impetus which the study of positive law has received.
New sources have been discovered. Their newness and importance
have excited the zeal of many scholars who have studied them profoundly;
a fact which made a review of the older sources, still by far the
most important, necessary. These two circumstances soon rendered it imperative
to proceed to the making of scrupulous dogmatic researches. Thus
there now is a new life among jurisconsults, and a great activity, which, it
is my hope, may continue long.”</span></p></dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a href="#noteref_19" id="note_19" class="pginternal">19.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext">Revue

learning with rare clearness and plastic beauty in the presentation of

of goods, those which should constitute the subject of their investigations,
have taken two directions in recent times. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bastiat</span></span> here confines
himself too exclusively to commerce. The political economist should concern himself
only with wants and satisfactions, where the labor, which is the connecting
link between them, is undertaken by some other person for a consideration.
Thus the ordinary act of respiration lies outside the circle, that of the diver,
which is paid for, does not. (Harmonies économiques, 1850, 68 ff.) But
even Robinson Crusoe had his own system of economy. Are the products
which the farmer consumes in his own home, the work he does himself, any
the less matters of economic moment than the products he sells, or the labors
of his servants? <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Schäffle</span></span> is right when he says that ordinary
respiration is no economic function, because it is an unconscious necessity of nature.
But his definition is too broad, inasmuch as he places the essence of the economic
character of goods or of an act, in the conscious adaptation of means to
human ends. (Tübinger Progr. z. 27 Sept. 1862, 9, 24 seq.) To take a
walk is no economic operation, although it may be the best means to a very
important end,—health. The same goods or the same act may have, frequently,
according to the end proposed, an economic or non-economic character.
The beauty of the human body, for instance, however systematically
made use of for purposes of vanity, is not economic <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">goods</span></em>. But it is an
economic speculation, base though it be, when a man relies on his handsome
figure to secure a wealthy wife, or, for purposes of gain, allows her to pose as
a model to artists or to take part in
<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">tableaux vivants</span></span>. According to
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">C. Menger</span></span>,
Grundsätze der Volkswirthschaftslehre (1871) I, 51 ff., there are no economic
goods, but those the disposable supply of which is, at most, equal to
the quantity that is required. But is not the largest navigable stream, even
in the most thinly populated country, an economic good?</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a href="#noteref_66" id="note_66" class="pginternal">66.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hegel</span></span>, Rechtsphilosophie, § 67. Even

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Schäffle</span></span> is right, when he says
that to repay personal services with material commodities which do not afford
as much food etc., as the former have cost in expenditure of vital energy, is a
slow and frequently a very cruel kind of cannibalism. (Kapitalismus und

demonstrate, however, no more than this, that that class of goods has something
very peculiar. Thus <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Malthus</span></span>, Principles of Political Economy
(1820), chap. I, sect. I, objects that they cannot be inventoried or taxed; but can
material goods be so completely? Can all the parts of the wealth of a nation
be so inventoried and taxed? <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rau</span></span>, Lehrbuch der pol. Œkonomie
(1826) I, § 46, remarks that the personal aptitude to perform services dies with the
person, and that personal services cannot be stored up (?), etc. I appeal
simply to the definition I have given above of economic goods, and which
applies equally to services of every kind which can be performed for other
people. Besides, those who oppose this view are unable to give a satisfactory
explanation of all the phenomena of commerce. Of course, the qualification
<span class="tei tei-q">“recognized as useful”</span> is of the utmost importance as a mark to determine
what is goods. But a prima donna, or a world-renowned physician, cast naked
by shipwreck on the shores of North America, is certainly, better off

words, by no means, exhaust the meaning expressed by <span class="tei tei-q">“relation.”</span> Thus,

is used to designate utility, and sometimes useful objects (so called values).
A clear distinction, however, should be made between utility and value in
use. Utility is a quality of things themselves, in relation, it is true, to human
wants. Value in use is a quality imputed to them, the result of man's
thought, or of his view of them. Thus, for instance, in a beleagured city, the
stores of food do not increase in utility, but their value in use does. Compare

each of the goods to be exchanged, and the sum total of their energies in

ages, in all countries except Italy and, even up to the seventeenth century,
the moral sciences were under a one-sided theological influence, whose ascetic
condemnation of self-interest may have been well enough during a
period of violence. By virtue of a very natural reaction, and as a protest of
individualism against the constraint of absolute monarchy, the materialists
of the eighteenth century endeavored to discover, even in the most exalted
phenomena of human society, only the expression of an enlightened self-interest.

was opposed, especially by the English, who could not be blind to the
influence exerted in public life by the feeling for the common good.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">David Hume</span></span>, Treatise on Human Nature (1739), III, 54,

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hutcheson</span></span>, System of Moral Philosophy (1755), speaks of

of all the individuals that compose it. Each individual looks out best for his
own interests, and, hence, that nation must be the richest, in which each individual
is most completely left to himself. (If this were so, savage nations
would be the richest!) <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cooper</span></span> goes so far as to disapprove of
the protection afforded to commerce on the high seas by a national navy; no naval war is
worth what it costs, and merchants should protect themselves. He says, too,
that the word <span class="tei tei-q">“nation”</span> is an invention of the grammarians, made to save
the trouble of circumlocution, a nonentity! <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Adam Smith</span></span> is, as

in the study of their own advantage are led <span class="tei tei-q">“naturally, or rather necessarily”</span>
(IV, ch. 2), to the employment which is most useful to society. But here
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Adam Smith</span></span> overlooks the fact, that every individual nation
strives after earthly immortality, and is, in consequence, frequently compelled to make

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">D. North</span></span>, Discourses upon Trade (1691), 13 seq., says, that in

Among those who, in antiquity, most energetically maintained that the
idea of national economy is not a merely nominal one, is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Plato</span></span>
(De Republ., IV, 420, I, 462); more recently, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Fichte</span></span> (Der
geschlossene Handelstaat, 1800), although, in general, the socialists attach as little
importance to nationality as their most decided opponents. Adam Müller is a writer
who deserves recognition for his advocacy of national economy, and of the state as a
whole, paramount to individuals, and even generations. He gives war the credit of
causing the scientific knowledge of the state to cast deeper roots, and of enlightening
individuals in the most forcible way, that they are parts of one
great whole. (Elemente der Staatskunst, 1809, I, 7, 113). He calls public economy,
as a whole, the product of all products. What, he inquires, is the use of
all wealth, if it does not guarantee itself? And this, it can do, only through
the organization of the whole people, that is, through the nation (I, 202).
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Adam Smith's</span></span> theory of labor would be correct if it considered
the entire national life of a people itself as one huge piece of labor. (II, 265). And

world-market. (II, 290). Similarly, the protective tariff theoreticians,

at the same question. The law (to avoid strife, or to settle controversies)
looks upon the debtor as the owner of the capital, and lets him run all the
risk; Political Economy, on the other hand, looking deeper into the nature
of the contract, reaches an entirely opposite result. The mere jurist has a
dangerous tendency to undervalue the reign of the laws of nature; the mere
political economist, just as readily, undervalues the element of free will.

indeed, all <span class="tei tei-q">“sociology,”</span> a concrete deductive science, whose
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span> conclusions, based on the laws of
human nature, must be tested by experience, either by comparing them with
the concrete phenomena themselves, or with their emperical laws. It, in
this, resembles astronomy and physics. (System of Logic VI, ch. 9. Essays
on some unsettled questions of Political E., No. 5.) According to this,
an economic fact can be said to have received a scientific explanation only
when its deductive and inductive explanations have met and agreed. <span class="tei tei-q">“Only
those principles which, after they have been obtained by the one, are confirmed
by the other method, can be said to have a scientific basis.”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">von

me to mention points wherein caution is necessary: A. Even the deductive
explanation of economic facts is based on observation, namely, on the
self-observation of the person accounting for them, who, consciously or unconsciously,
must always inquire: If I had experienced or accomplished the
same fact, what should I have thought, willed and felt? The man who cannot
translate himself into the souls of others, will give a wrong explanation
of most economic facts. In the question, for instance, of the determination
of the price of an article, the person who can look into the mind of one of
the contracting parties only, will give a one-sided explanation of the facts.
B. Moreover, every explanation, that is, satisfactory connection of the fact
seeking explanation with other facts which are already clear, can be only
provisional. The wider our horizon grows, the deeper should our solution
of all questions become. A hundred years hence, should science increase in
the mean time, the solutions which are satisfactory to us will be looked
down upon by our posterity, as the speculations of our fathers antecedent to
Adam Smith's time are looked down upon by us.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a href="#noteref_170" id="note_170" class="pginternal">170.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext"><span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Tanquam e vinculis sermocinantur</span></span>, says

two causes: the flowing of the water from the polar seas to the equator (polar current),
and the revolution of the earth about its axis (equinoctial current); besides
which, there are the reflex currents produced by the horizontal form of the
coast-lands. Thanks to these natural ocean highways, England is nearer to
almost all the important mercantile coasts of the world by 300 geographical
miles than the Eastern States of the American Union. The only exception
is the Atlantic coast of America north of the Equator. North Americans
to pass the line, or to double one of the two great capes, are obliged first to
traverse the ocean as far as the Azores. On the other hand, the western
coast of South America is very widely separated from Mexico, for instance,
by its ocean currents. The colonization of America by Europe, instead of
by China, is a consequence of the direction of ocean currents, as is also the

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">von Cancrin</span></span>, Dorpater Jahrbuch IV, 1, distinguishes the ice
zone, the reindeer-moss (a lichen on which the reindeer live in winter) zone, the forest
zone, the zone within the limits of which cattle are raised; that in which the
culture of rye begins, that in which it becomes permanent; the wheat, fruit-tree,
vine, maize, olive, sugar cane and silk-worm zones. The United States
are divided into cattle-raising, wheat-raising, cotton-raising, rice-raising and
sugar-raising zones. Even in Europe, beyond the 60th parallel of north latitude,
wheat can scarcely be cultivated; the polar limits of rye raising extend,
at most, six or seven degrees farther. Towards the north, barley extends
sometimes as far as the 70th degree. Here agriculture almost ceases, and
the inhabitants are compelled to confine themselves to animal substances for
food. On the other hand, these three cereals are not adapted to a tropical
climate, while the bread-fruit tree, for instance, does not thrive at more than
22 degrees from the Equator, nor the banana at more than 35. Compare

- 39.2°; in Iceland, + 12° and - 1.6°. In England, the myrtle,
laurel, camelia and fuchsia stand the winter well; while the vine no where
ripens. On the other hand, Astrakan and Hungary are vine growing countries,
although the former is as cold in winter as North Cape, and although the
cold is more intense in Hungary than in the Faroe Islands, where neither
the oak nor the beech grow any longer. No good wine is produced on the
western coast of France, north of 47° 20' north latitude; in Champagne,
north of 49°, or in the Rheingau, north of 51°. In Norway, the average
heat is greater on the coast than in the heart of the country where, however,
grain ripens, while it does not on the coast; for the mildness of the winter,
no matter how great, can make no compensation for the want of heat. On
the other hand, the cattle on the coast can remain much longer out of doors,
and the sea seldom freezes in such a way as to interfere with the fisheries.

has made some interesting attempts to calculate by a mathematical
process the amount of heat necessary to vegetable, during the period
of vegetation. Thus, for instance, wheat requires about 12°
(Réaumur) of heat during 140 days; that is, nearly 140 x 12° = 1680° Réaumur.
In Venezuela, the sugar cane requires a longer time to grow in a higher and

nothing more than a difference of gradation. Even in the most active
of businesses there is a limit which the accumulation of means of
production cannot pass without a relative diminution of the income. This
boundary is imposed by the limited nature of those organic beings which
must contribute to production either actively or passively. Thus, for instance,
a manufacturing establishment or commercial business can be enlarged
with advantage only so long as it is still possible for one superintendent
to conduct it. And so, when cattle are furnished with very abundant
and substantial food, a pound of meat costs the producer a much higher
price than when they are more moderately supplied: sometimes in the ratio
of 1.95:0.98. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Boussingault</span></span>, Economie rurale, II.
Where there is absolute over-feeding, the producer must suffer loss.
But, even inorganic nature imposes its own limits here; as, for
instance, when ships, machines etc., on account of the insufficient
strength of the materials of which they are made, cannot be
constructed beyond a certain size. But all these limits are much
narrower than those imposed by the quality of immovability.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a href="#noteref_209" id="note_209" class="pginternal">209.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Senior</span></span>,

point forward every increase in the amount of salt was attended by
diminished returns, and finally led to complete barrenness. See

the whole year. A similar gift of nature to tropical lands is the
date tree. It is turned to so many different uses that the Arabs
of the coast of the Persian Gulf say that it is possible to construct a ship,
rig it, supply and freight it, from date trees. Houses are built of palm wood,
covered with palm leaves, furnished with palm mats, lighted with palm chips,
and heated with palm coals. The whole architecture of these countries is fashioned
by the date tree. Date wine is the favorite intoxicating beverage. There
is a proverb current there that a good housewife can vary the preparation of
the date for her guests every day in the month. Even the pulp is eaten.
Each tree yields an average of 50-250 lbs. of dates; and a tree may last over
200 years. An acre may contain more than 200 trees. The labor of cultivation
is very slight, although it demands more care than the banana. Compare

here, as in the case of slave labor. As a rule, hope is not only a more
humane but a sharper spur to action. But if force is employed at all, there is
no doubt that the greater it is, the more effectual it is. Wherever the right of
corporal punishment has been taken from the masters, the technic value of
serfdom has uniformly decreased. In the English West Indies, formerly,
philanthropic masters who treated their negroes with unwonted gentleness,
obtained from them, as a rule, very poor economic results. While each of
the slaves expressed the greatest indignation at the idleness of the others

not simply in writing prescriptions, but who is also the professional family
friend. The same may be said of the state official, clergyman etc., from
whom it is demanded that he should sacrifice his entire life to the service of
the public. Against adopting piece wages in the case of state officials, it may
be further urged that no case at law, no act of public life is precisely similar
to any other. It cannot be applied to that of soldiers, because they are called
upon for action only after a long term of peace, during all of which they must
keep themselves in readiness for war. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Schäffle</span></span>, N. Œk.,

wherever that was practicable, but by a fixed salary. An able
professor in a university is of use to it not only by
his lectures, but by his reputation and example etc.; hence, here, a combination
of piece wages and of a regular salary is preferred. As to services, the
permanency of which constitutes their essential character, remuneration is
also wont to be permanent or hereditary, as in the case of very many public
officers, while civilization is as yet unadvanced. Later, in proportion as the

confusion produced by the employment of scientific terminology in daily life. Until
within a short time every possible meaning of the word <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">capital</span></span>
was to be found in the dictionary of the French Academy, its scientific
politico-economical meaning alone excepted. During the middle ages, the Latin
<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">capitale</span></span> was used to signify both
loaned money and cattle. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ducange</span></span>, s.v.) When culture was at its
highest in Greece, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Demosthenes</span></span> entertained very good
ideas of the nature of capital which he sometimes calls ἀφορμὴ, sometimes ἔρανος, the
meaning of which he extends also to the incorporeal capital of a good reputation.
(Adv. Mid., 574; pro Phorm, 947.) The same may be said of the Roman in conception of
<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">peculium</span></span>. See
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hildebrand's</span></span> Jahrbb., 1866, I. 338. On the beginnings of the

of money, but on the state of profit and on the relation between the demand and supply
of capital. Similarly, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">J. Massie</span></span>, An Essay on the governing
Causes of the Rate of Interest (1750). <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Quesnay</span></span>, Dialogue sur
le Commerce, 173 (ed. Daire), shows that he had a very clear conception of the operation,
and of the principal component parts of capital. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Turgot</span></span>, Sur la
Formation et la Distribution des Richesses, § 14, 54-79, came very near the truth, and yet
missed it. He recognized the necessity of advances which, as a rule, are the
result of saving, in every case of production. He also distinguishes in the
product of the soil, besides the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">produit
net</span></span> and the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">subsistance du
laboureur</span></span>, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">profit</span></span> of the latter. He likewise
points out a great number of differences between the <span class="tei tei-q">“price of money”</span> considered
in its relation to trade, and in its relation to loans. He explains the interest on
capital, as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Schröder</span></span>, in his Schatz-und Rentkammer, 231, and
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Benjamin Franklin</span></span>, in his Inquiry into the Nature of a Paper
Currency (1729) had done before, by the fact that the owner of capital can purchase a
piece of land with his capital, and thus draw an income without working. Money, he
said, was indeed not productive, but neither was any other thing that could be loaned
or leased, with the exception of land and cattle. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Adam Smith</span></span>
deserves the greatest credit for his analysis of the idea of capital, although he
opposes <span class="tei tei-q">“capital”</span> to what the Germans call capital-in-use, the <span class="tei tei-q">“stock for
immediate consumption.”</span> When <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Canard</span></span>, Principes d'Economie
politique (1801) and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">J. B. Say</span></span>, Cours pratique, 1828, I, 285,
included man's power of labor in capital, they took a retrograde step. <span class="tei tei-q">“Labour is
Capital, primary and fundamental.”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Colton</span></span>, 275. Every
grown-up individual, says <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">McCulloch</span></span>, Principles, 1825, II, ch.
2, may be looked upon as a machine which has cost several years of continued
care and a considerable sum for its construction. It is only another
side of this same perversity, when <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">McCulloch</span></span> seeks to force
the results produced by animals and machines into the definition of labor.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Schlozer</span></span>, Anfangsgründe (1805), I, 21, goes so far as to
call the soul, raw material, which receives productive power from the
labor of the teacher! For a calculation of the money value of man in
the different ages of life, see Statis. Journ. XVI, 43 ff. See, on
the other hand, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Malthus</span></span>, Definitions, ch. 7;

include pieces of land in themselves under the head of capital, seem to be
better founded. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hermann</span></span> defines capital the durable basis
of every utility possessed of value in exchange. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Schäffle</span></span>
reckons land as nature offers it to us, among <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">free</span></em> goods. From the
moment that labor and capital are spent upon it, it becomes immovable capital,
but he concedes that it still preserves many essential points which distinguish
it from other capital. (N. Œk. Theorie der ausschliessenden Absatzverhältnisse, 1867,
65 ff., 89 ff.) These differences appear to me to be still more important than that
which land and capital have in common; especially as the historic development of
their relations proceeds for the most part in opposite directions. Thus, for
instance, as civilization advances, land is wont to become dearer and capital
cheaper. How difficult would it be to introduce clearness into the ideas of
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intensive</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">extensive</span></em> agriculture, if land were accounted
capital! And it is not only always theoretically, but also very often, in practice,
possible to separate the value of a given piece of land from the most durable
capital-improvements (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">Kapitalmeliorationen</span></span>) made on it. It is only

the bellows as a pair of very strong and durable lungs. Tongs take the
place of fingers, just as a spoon does of the empty hand, and the knife the
place of the teeth. A great number of machines, on the other hand, may
be compared to a complete workman. Thus, the action of the mill which
grinds grain has very little resemblance to the blowing of the wind or the
running of the water, whereas the rising and falling of the pestle in the
small mortar for throwing grenades corresponds to the motion of the arm.

in the production of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Parmesan</span></span> cheese, is a thousand times as
great as that played by the soil; and in the production of a Dutch tulip, a hundred
thousand times as great. The English are wont, similarly, to over-estimate
the relative power of labor. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ponocratie</span></span>, after

Government, II, 5, 40 ff., is of opinion, that, at least 9/10 of the value of the
products of the soil, useful to man, are to be ascribed to labor, and, in the
case of most, even 99/100. And so, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Berkeley</span></span> (1735), Querist,
No. 38 seq. This view is advocated in its boldest form,—a thing unusual in the
case of the independent disciples of a great master—by
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">McCulloch</span></span>, Principles, II, ch. i, that it is to labor, and to
labor alone, that man owes everything that possesses any value in exchange. Similarly,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">J. Mill</span></span>, Elements (1824), III, 2. The
consequences which socialism might draw from these premises are self-evident.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Karl Marx's</span></span> whole system, for instance, rests, without any
attempt at demonstration, on the assumption that the Ricardo school is right. Much

Land and labour together are the sources of all wealth; without a competency of lands
there would be no subsistence, and but a very poor one without labour.”</span>

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ricardo's</span></span> school is wont to bring capital under the head of

does, his parents had done. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Umpfenbach</span></span>, Nat. Œk., 64.) There
is only one way in which labor, and even then the expression is not exactly correct, can
be looked upon as the only factor in production; and that is to presuppose the forces of
nature as matters of course (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">als sich von

every service which is paid for, according to wish, seems productive.
On the other hand, the consumer ascribes productiveness to all those kinds
of labor the achievements of which he may use, and which he can obtain at
a convenient price. Whenever, therefore, he pays for a service voluntarily,
he acknowledges its productiveness. Lastly, from a national-economical
point of view, all labor is considered productive which increases the quantity
of goods exposed for sale in the market; and this, personal services do.
The technic productiveness, which depends on the execution of the technic
ideas floating before the mind of the workman, must be distinguished from this
economic productiveness. It is possible that, technically labor may be very
productive, and yet cause economic loss; for instance, the fine arts and the
so-called master pieces of the trades! See <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Seneca</span></span>, De Benef.,
II, 33. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">H.</span></span> (33) furnishes a very good refutation of the
doctrine that a great deal depends on whether the labor has been paid from capital
or from income. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Eiselen</span></span>, Volkswirthschaft (1843), 27 ff.,
remarks, that the laborer, for instance, who grows corn, must besides look
after his health and the preservation of his house; this is a
part of his necessary aggregate labor. Why, then, should
it be called unproductive when such secondary labor is performed by particular
persons? Otherwise the farmer would have no time whatever for his
principal business! Edinburgh Review, 1804, IV, 343 ff.;

(Lehrbuch, 68; Tüb. Zeitschr., 1868, 230) conditions the notion of productiveness by the
presence of a superfluity of values. But, it may be asked, does a family,
which does no more than support itself, labor unproductively? (Compare, however,

distinguishes between economic labor and the labor
of culture: the latter is incorporated into the man himself, the former one
employed on the external world, in order to transform it in a way corresponding
to human wants. Viewed from the stand-point of Political Economy,
the latter only is productive. (Volkswirthschaftslehre, 1865, 26 ff.)</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a href="#noteref_331" id="note_331" class="pginternal">331.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext">We
might, indeed, compare original production, that which preceded all

may be claimed, also, though in a less degree, for the streams that carry the
civilizing fruits of the coasts far into the interior. Nearly all large cities not
situated on the harbors of coasts derive their importance from rivers; especially when
they have been built on spots adapted by nature to the transhipment of merchandise. That
Venice finally eclipsed Genoa is to be ascribed, in greatest part, to its control
of an important stream, the Po. The economic importance of Holland, of
Hamburg and Bremen will, in the long run, bear the same relation to one
another as the geographical importance of the valleys of the Rhine, Elbe
and Weser. As nothing is more disastrous to a nation than the loss of its
coast (we need only cite the efforts of the Lybian kings and, later, of Philip
of Macedon to conquer the Greek colonies on their coasts; and in more recent
times, of Russia before Peter the Great, or of the Zollverein without
the shores of the German sea), so, also, the economic and political influence
of a stream increases as one approaches its mouth. Hence the justification
of the great interest taken by Germany and Austria in the question
of the Danubian principalities. The United States recognized this fact when
they purchased Louisiana for 80,000,000 francs. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bignon</span></span>, Hist. de

by the three Asiatic Mesopotamias: that between the Euphrates and the
Tigris; that between the Ganges and the Brahmapootra; that between the
Hoang-Ho and the Yang-tse-Kiang, to which finally the Punjab might be
added. This relation is recognized by popular consciousness, in the case of
the Ganges, by the belief in the sacredness of the stream. No river has had
so much influence on civilization as the Nile: its periodical risings have
made the labor of agriculture extraordinarily easy; their extent and regularity
favored the progress of astronomy; the flooding over of the land led to
geodesy; the hydraulic labors necessitated by the rising of the waters produced
a school of architecture to which the river furnished an excellent means of
transportation for the enormous masses to be moved. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">K. Ritter</span></span>,

Europe have the advantage over Asia and Africa. While the Danube is,
in places, scarcely three German miles from the Rhine—which, however,
flows in an almost opposite direction—in Asia, the eastern streams are separated
from the western, and the northern from the southern, by a strip of
land difficult to be traveled, and about 300 German miles in extent. Besides,
the principal streams of northern Asia have their exit into the Frozen Ocean,
a fact which diminishes their importance greatly. The source of the Missouri
is only about one mile distant from the Columbia river, although the

<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">non defuit homini, sed scientiæ, quod

proof of the insignificance of the science of the time. Think of the increase
during the last hundred years of the branches of study in our German universities.
There are now thirty-four regular professors in the Leipzig

principle proves true, that an excessive division of labor, where the broader
connection and the deeper foundation of all sciences disappear from the consciousness,
undermines intellectual health and freedom. And the injury here is
greater and more irreparable than in the domain of mere physical labor. See

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ch. Fourier</span></span> (Théorie des quatre Mouvements,
1808. Théorie de l'Unité universelle, 1822. Le nouveau Monde industriel
et sociétaire, 1829) are based upon the following fundamental ideas. A. The
present civilization is that of a topsy-turvy world, especially in so far as it
ascribes a <span class="tei tei-q">“moral”</span> (a word always used by him in an ironical sense) self-government
to man. In Fourier's world, on the other hand, every man is supposed, at all times, to
give free rein to every <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">passion</span></span>;
and the play of these gratifications constitutes the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">harmonie</span></span>, in which the poorest find more
enjoyment than do kings at the present time. (See § 207 of this work.) B.
The main thing to further this is a radical reform in the division and cooperation
of labor as they exist at present. Instead of the present villages
and cities, we should have only phalansteries, each with 2,000 inhabitants, and
situated in the center of the land cultivated by them. Instead of the present
nations and states, we should have a universal confederate republic, hierarchically
graded, with French as the universal language. According to the demands
of the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">passion papillonne</span></span>,
each one should carry on the most different kinds of business side by side, and
each one of them at most two hours per day; i.e., every one should be a dilettante, no
one a master, and everything should be done as badly as possible.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Proudhon</span></span>, Contradictions économiques,
ch. 3, objects to this, that a workman must, in some way, be held responsible
for his work. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Fourier</span></span> himself calculates that, in his
<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">harmonie</span></span> all pleasures
are productive labor; and that by this constant change, one might be
satisfied with from 4-½ to 5-½ hours of sleep, and that even children 2-½ years
old might take part in the work. Thus, there would be a great rivalry between
apple-growers and pear-growers, so great <span class="tei tei-q">“that more intrigues in attack
and defense [<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">passion cabaliste</span></span>]
would arise there than in all the cabinets of Europe,”</span> in the settling of which the
growers of quinces would act as intermediaries.
There are, in addition to all this, wonderful aids; a fructifying
crown of light rises over the north pole; oranges bloom in Siberia; the sea
becomes as delicious as lemonade; dangerous animals die, and in their stead
anti-lions and anti-whales come into being, animals useful to man, which
draw his ships for him during calms. These ideas are by no means retracted
in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Fourier's</span></span> later works, See Nouveau Monde (Oeuvres) IV, 447.
The propositions of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Robert Owen</span></span>, A new View of Society (1812),
have much similarity with those of Fourier. They differ only in the absence of the
French barrack-like character of the phalanxes, and the fantastic character of the
presentation of the doctrine. He would have all the land divided into districts
of 1,000 acres each; each district to have a four-cornered town with 1,000
inhabitants, following a system of production and consumption in common,
but not with full equality; carrying on both agriculture and other business.
A principal feature here is an entirely new system of education. The author
says that man has hitherto been the slave of an execrable trinity: positive religion,
personal property and indissoluble wedlock. (Declaration of mental
independence.)</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a href="#noteref_396" id="note_396" class="pginternal">396.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext">Compare

south. In the north, there was one deaf-mute, a case of blindness and of insanity
in every 96; in the south, in every 672; a pauper, invalid and prisoner
in every 6 at the north, in every 54 at the south. In Maine, 1/12th of the

This is a strong reason why a high degree of civilization, where there are
not counteracting influences, must make slavery less endurable. The more
valuable slaves are, the worse is their condition. In the unfertile Bahamas,
the price was £21; in Demarara, £86. In the former place they were required

admixture of Christianity and Democracy. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Muzzi</span></span>, Annali di Bologna,
1840, I, 479.) Italy, at the end of the fourteenth century, was entirely free
from Christian serfdom. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Muratori</span></span>, Antt. Ital., I, 798.) In the
canton of Berne, Switzerland, slavery was gradually abolished, the process commencing
about the beginning of the fifteenth century. It continued, however,
in the case of ordinary masters until 1798. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sugenheim</span></span>, p. 530

(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Wilkins</span></span>, Leges, 29) remained without result. The steps taken by
William I, towards a much narrower end, however, seem to have been more successful.

From the time of the Norman conquest, prisoners of war ceased to recruit the
ranks of slavery. Under Henry III and Edward I, socage tenants became
more and more frequent; but, before long, their duties became less onerous,
and might be discharged by others hired for the purpose, instead of by themselves.
The first remarkable vestige of a class working for wages is met
with in the law of 1351, which may be considered an effort made by the
nobility to oppose the tendencies in favor of emancipation, which were a
consequence of the development of cities. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Eden</span></span>, State of the

under Wat Tyler and Straw, who wished to abolish servitude at a blow, failed of its
object, we find that there were a great many instances of emancipation by individuals in
the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries when death or sickness overtook them, in
which they declared the moral unfitness of slavery. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Wycliffe</span></span>:

constitute an ever-increasing portion of the total number of servants. In
Prussia, in 1816, the number of servants who ministered to personal comfort
was only 4.19 per cent. of the total number of servants engaged in industry;
of female servants, it was 13.4 per cent. In 1861, on the other hand, the
percentages were 8.4 and 37.2. In Great Britain, of the total number of
servants over 20 years of age, only 2 per cent. were engaged in personal
services. In 1841, they were 3-½ per cent. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Meidinger</span></span>.) In

to find a philosophical basis for the right of property, have taken two principal
directions, the first a juridical, the second a political one. The axiom,
<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">res nullius cedit primo
occupanti</span></span> (compare L. 3, Digest, XLI, 1), explains only the smallest part
of the relations of property, and that only because of a very fortuitous
circumstance. According to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hobbes</span></span> (Leviathan, 24), property has
its origin in the recognition of it by the power of the state, by the
<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">autorité publique</span></span>, the
<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">gouvernement</span></span>
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bossuet</span></span>, Politique tirée de l'Ecriture, Sainte, L. 3, 4),
or as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Montesquieu</span></span> (Esprit des Lois
XXVI., 15) more mildly expresses it, in the laws. The application of this
principle would, on account of the extreme changeableness of the laws of
every state, lead to most extreme insecurity, and to a steady oscillation from
one Utopia to another, from one revolution to another, if it were not, at the
same time, recognized that each one had a just title to the acquisitions he
had made, not because the law, for the time being existing, acknowledged
the right, but because they were the product of his labor and saving. The
theory which bases the right of property on contract cannot be objected to
with as much reason. Thus, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hugo Grotius</span></span>, Jus Belli et
Pacis, II, 2, who even justifies the occupation of things without an owner, on
the supposition of the existence of an implied contract. It is very characteristic of
the English, that in their political language, the words <span class="tei tei-q">“liberty”</span> and
<span class="tei tei-q">“property”</span> are so frequently found in each other's company. In one of his classic
speeches made by Fox in 1784, he gives a definition of liberty which begins
with the words, <span class="tei tei-q">“It consists in the safe and sacred possession of a man's
property”</span> etc. The recent doctrine, not unfrequently to be met with, that
every man has a right to an amount of property corresponding to his wants,
may be used to sanction all kinds of socialistic inferences. An entirely bewildered
and bewildering description is to be found in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Proudhon's</span></span> Qu'est ce
que la Propriété, 1848, as the precursor of which <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Brissot's</span></span>
Recherches philosophiques sur le Droit de Propriété et le Vol, may be considered. In
medieval times, there are always a multitude of other titles to property besides
production and saving. The title which is held in highest esteem for the
time being is always because of this very extreme vis-a-vis of all other
titles, strengthened and made general.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a href="#noteref_471" id="note_471" class="pginternal">471.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext">The word socialism brought into use by
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">L. Reybaud</span></span> is as ambiguous as
the word communism is simple and intelligible. But most socialists agree
that actual <span class="tei tei-q">“society”</span> (which is indeed to be distinguished from the state) is,
together with its foundations, the existing relations of property and the
family, entirely wrong. A radical reconstruction, they say, is needed to
remove forever the chief evil of this system, viz.: the glaring difference between
the rich and the poor, the educated and the uneducated. The difference
between the doctrines of the socialists and of Political Economy does
not, by any means, consist in this, that the former concerns itself more with
the welfare of the lower classes, or even that it gives wider scope to economy
in common. But socialism is, indeed, a living or housekeeping in
common (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">Gemeinwirthschaft</span></span>),
which goes far beyond the feeling for the common interest
(<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">Gemeinsinn</span></span>). Such economy
in common is always opposed to freedom, and, at its first introduction, contrary to
law. It can guarantee no compensation to those who have suffered from violence or force,
because it leads to a thoughtless and wasteful exhaustion of the nation's resources,
inasmuch as it weakens the incentive to industry and frugality. Political Economy,
on the other hand, recommends an <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">expropriation</span></span> when the incentives
to industry and frugality are thereby strengthened; and the increased resources
thus obtained serve it, as full compensation to those whose property

In the contemporary practice of the Greeks, with the increasing democratization of
the state, it became more and more usual for it to bear the expense of the outlay
for the means of subsistence of the great crowd. (See <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Plutarch</span></span>,
Cimo, 10.) Every act of public life was paid for. Citizens were paid for attending
popular meetings three oboli per day, while the pay of the soldiers was six, and
that of the sailors three. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Thucyd.</span></span>, III, 17; VII, 27; VIII,
45.) The pay of the commonest day laborer was from three to four oboli per day.

as possible might participate in this species of remuneration. Thus, in
Athens, when it had only about 20,000 inhabitants, there were 6,000 judges.
In addition to all this, there were numberless feasts, plays, banquets etc., which
were offered to the people gratis. The wealthy who were compelled to meet
all the expense thus incurred, lived in such a state of terror of the populace,
that they considered their own impoverishment as a species of deliverance.
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Xenoph.</span></span>, Conviv., 4, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lysias</span></span>,

De Invalido, de sacra Olea, seq.) There is little difference between this
state of things and a semi-community of goods. Only that, indeed, the great
mass of the slaves were excluded from enjoying them. The contrast which
somewhat later distinguished the Cynics from the Cyreno-Epicureans affords
a striking analogy to that which, in our own times, exists between the
pure socialists and the worshipers of mammon after the fashion of Doctor
Ure. Concerning the Utopia of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Iambulos</span></span>, see

expense of great candidates or of the state, was developed to a very great extent. The
masses lived very largely by the sale of their right of suffrage to the highest
bidder. At the election of consuls in the year 54, 500,000 thalers were offered

colonization at the expense of the state, and the increase of soldiers' pay.

poor-laws enacted in England, Spain etc., were not sufficient to supply a remedy. The

to his rose-covered bed, hung with curtains of gold cloth, on which he was
reclining, his subjects were a prey to the horrors of famine, to such an extent

More</span></span> bluntly says that all existing governments are in fact only permanent
conspiracies of the rich to further their own interests under the mask of the common
good, and to despoil labor. The abolition of money, which should be continued in use only
to carry on foreign war, would, he contends, remove all misery. There was
no really private property in his Utopia. There should be a rigid superintendence
of all work by the public authorities, whose duty it should be to see
to it, that no one should abandon agricultural pursuits. All should eat at a
common table and dress after the same fashion. Internal commerce should
give way to a mutual exchange of gifts under the supervision of the state.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Campanella</span></span>, besides a community of goods, recommends continually
varying occupation, to last not more than four hours daily; education in common,
especially by means of pictures, popular encyclopedias etc., all under the supreme
guidance of a despotism to be composed of the wise, some secular
and some spiritual, operating through the confessional. Socialists nearly
always succeed better in the critical part of their works than in the positive.

be denied that his freedom and equality contain, to say the least, germs of
communism by no means insignificant. But, he would, in the present state
of civil society, have a feeling of respect for the rights of property implanted
in the mind of the child very early, and even before the feeling of liberty is
developed. (Emile, 1762, Livre II.) About the same time <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Morelly</span></span>

effect. We need only refer to the abolition of the census, the payments made
to the workingmen who attended the section meetings, two francs per diem,
the enormous extension of confiscation, requisitions and forced loans, the
revolution effected in the fortunes of individuals by the system of issuing assignats,
the maximum affixed to the price of all the necessaries of life, the
abolition of indirect taxes, and of what remained of the economic institutions
handed down from the middle ages. According to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">St. Just</span></span>:

of large cities etc., see <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Buonarotti</span></span>, La Conjuration de B., 1821.
This book contributed powerfully towards the revival of communistic ideas after the

from the more ancient, especially by the industrial coloring given to their
theories, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cabet</span></span>, Voyage en Icarie, 1840, II, holds a very
prominent place. He declares the abolition of religion, of the family and of the state, to
be open questions, and desires to bring the practice of a community of
goods to a successful issue only through the peaceful channel of conviction.

Spite of all this, that community of goods produced a chronic state of poverty in the

and is a species of community of goods. There was once a singular contest on
this subject, carried on between the Minorites and the Pope, in the time of
Louis of Bavaria. The Minorites claimed that property was a thing, so
much to be condemned, that even food, at the moment of eating it, did not
belong to the person using it. The Pope taught on the other hand, that even
Christ and the Apostles possessed property, part personal and part in common.

which it is sought to establish the doctrine of a community of goods. The

It is very easy, they say, when one is himself in comfortable circumstances,
to represent to the poor that their poverty is a school for heaven,
and to preach a contempt for riches etc. They entirely forget, that the first

England, therefore among men both steady and accustomed to labor, who for conscience
sake had sacrificed so much, a community of goods was accompanied uninterruptedly by
famine. A change for the better took place, for the first time in 1623 with the
introduction of the institution of private property which was followed in 1624 by the
right of inheritance. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bancroft</span></span>, I, 340.) The military colonies
of Algeria, also, in which husbandry in common was carried on, begged, at the end of a

nothing but to generate idlers; and yet, these colonists were all powerful
men of about the same age, and accustomed to order and service in common.
They were, moreover, assisted by the nation with pay and food. Compare

(<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">la légitime</span></span>) to be
left to the heirs, which is still binding in France, but in a
very much developed form. The consequence is that last testaments are as
frequent in England as they are rare in France. There were, in Paris, in
1825, 7,649 judicial, and only 1,081 testamentary partitions of property.
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Monnier</span></span>.) In Great Britain, in 1838, the number
of testamentary alienations of property taxed stood to those in which there
was no will, in the proportion of 8:3; and the values of the alienated property
as 10:1. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Porter</span></span>.) Among a people noted for their high moral

inheritance! (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">R. Meyer</span></span>.) The strongest attack, from a scientific
point of view, made on the right of inheritance in more recent times, comes from Saint
Simonism. The founder himself, after a life rich in experience but poor in action,
spent in the search of much but in the finding of little, succeeded only
in arraying the industrial and proprietary classes against each other, in declaring
the poorest class to be the most important of all, and in basing the
new <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">religion of love</span></span> on the emancipation of labor. His disciples
went further. In order to abolish all the privileges of birth,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bazard</span></span>, Exposition de la Doctrine de Saint Simon, 1831, p. 172,
ff., taught that it was not enough to distribute public employments according to merit,
and in the interest of the people generally, but that the distribution of property
should be made in accordance with the same principle. The inequality of ownership should
correspond with the inequality of merit. Every one may, during his life,
keep what he had acquired himself, but give it to the state at death. Thus
would a reconciliation be effected between the general interest and private
interest; and the public revenue, supplied in this way, might easily be employed
in place of the revenue raised by such taxation as weighs most
heavily on the inferior classes. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">F. Huet</span></span>, also, Le Regne social

Turkey. There, the principal military fiefs are held in this way. Hence it is, that the
Turkish owner of such a fief builds as little as possible. When one of his walls
threatens to fall, it is kept standing by means of props. If it falls in fact, the only
consequence is that there are fewer rooms in the house, and the owner settles beside the
ruins. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Denon</span></span>, I, p. 193.) In the Butan, there exists a species

the common property which they have lost, be guaranteed the right to labor.

assignable right of demand, he considers immaterial capital. While bills of lading,
warehouse receipts, dock yard receipts etc., only represent goods, the bank note is
new goods. Even metallic money has only a credit-value, inasmuch as it can be used only to
effect exchanges. To the - of the creditor may correspond a + of the
debtor; but the latter is negative only in the sense that we speak of negative
electricity, a negative thermometrical degree. When an estate is leased, the
owner has, in his demand for rent, a vendible <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">plus</span></em>; but the lessee no

future payments on the lease discounted, the present sale-value of his estate
is diminished; or if it is not sold, the last party obtaining the discount has
made his available capital as much less by the advance as that of the lessor
has been increased.) The <span class="tei tei-q">“discounting of the future,”</span> that is, the apparent

personal qualities. A well organized society of work-men, without capital, may indeed
obtain credit, as for instance, the Schultze-Delitsch societies, the Russian

three kinds of economy are, by no means, coördinated.
While barter and purchase through the instrumentality of money, in every

the very source of wealth, the productive power of labor; the second causes

prohibition general. This was undoubtedly done for the convenience of employers

there were, in one year, 10,000 cases in which wages were garnisheed. (Annalen

just as well guarded against without dragging those whose wages are above

(Dialog. de Scaccario.) Magna Charta extended this provision so as to include

these laws, in consequence of a false principle of humanity, except anything

The capacity for circulation of a commodity is very much advanced when
the demand is wont to increase with the supply, as is the case with gold and

current of commerce may be too weak in a poor and thinly settled country
in order that supply and demand should always and everywhere meet and be
satisfied. Under such circumstances, their artificial concentration at certain
points is among the most efficient means of promoting the economy of the
whole people. The policy of freedom of commerce was recommended even

prices is followed by a time of low prices, we find an interval during which
sellers endeavor to defend themselves against the decline, and during which,

the market must be estimated as part of the cost of production. In consequence
of this, as well as of the difference of taxation duties etc., the superiority
of one producer to another may be more than overcome. In the case
of colonial commodities, which go into the interior of a country from different

quantities. If the same producers can pursue the cheaper mode of production which does not
suffice to supply the market, as well as the dearer, we have, generally, a price
which is the mean between the two costs of production. The same is true in the case of

speaks of an equation: the price of a commodity in a given market is always
high enough to produce a demand corresponding to the present supply, or
to an expected supply. The price of such commodities only which may
not be increased to any desirable extent depends on supply and demand. In
the case of all others, on the other hand, demand and supply depend on the
price, and this on the cost of production. Supply and demand always tend
to an equilibrium which is never really attained where the price is high
enough to cover the cost of production (?). (Principles, III, ch. 2, § 4; ch.
3, § 2.) <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Schäffle's</span></span> theory of prices is topped by the
proposition that all competing sellers and all competing buyers, after an economic
fashion, do not wish to sell below individual cost-value, nor to rise above individual
value in use, in purchasing. Hence, in a throng of competition of supply the costliest
productions step out of the field of competition in a descending cost-value
series; and in a throng of competition of demand, the most wearied
cravings in an ascending value-in-use series; until the quantities offered in
supply and asked for cover each other without loss, and have placed each
other in quantitative equilibrium. (N. Œk. Aufl., I, 188 ff.; compare 173,

Grundsätze, I, 195, shows that no monopolist can arbitrarily determine
the extent of the market for his monopoly-product when the price
is fixed, nor when the extent of the market is known, the height of
the price. Moreover, the price may remain longer above than under the cost
of production, for the reason that it is easier to abandon a business than to
begin one, and that the fear of loss is more frequently an incentive to action
than the hope of gain. Hence the price of corn, when everything else is
very dear, is more apt to vary from the average price, than in times when
everything is very cheap. For instance, the Munich prices from 1750 to 1800
show that its highest price was 147 per cent. above, and its lowest 47 per cent.

one's money to remain in foreign countries, and to use bills of exchange, banks etc., at

to remain in the country and the newly coined precious metal is clear

It is in accordance with the usual course of human development that the
exaggerations of the Mercantile System led to a reaction characterized by an
exaggeration in the opposite direction. Even <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Davanzati</span></span>, Sulle
Monete, 1588, traces the value of money back to human convention and refuses to find it
in nature. A natural calf, he thinks, is <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="it"><span style="font-style: italic">più
nobile</span></span> than a golden one; although he elsewhere expresses his admiration of
the precious metals, calls them <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="it"><span style="font-style: italic">cagioni

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Montanari</span></span> (ob., 1687) demonstrates from the
use of leather money etc., that the authority of the state is the only power
which gives money its character as money. (Della Moneta, 35.)
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Davenant</span></span> (ob., 1714) carries his inclination to call money <span class="tei tei-q">“the
servant of trade, measure of trade,”</span> so far as to compare it to a ticket or counter.
(Works, I, 355, 444.) Strongly as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Law</span></span>, himself, opposes the
convention theory (Trade and Money, ch. I; Sur l' Usage des Monnaies, 1720, p. 1.), his
disciple <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dutot</span></span>, in his Réflexions polit. sur le Commerce et les
Finances, 1738, 905, éd. Daire, contrasts not only paper money but also gold and silver
as representative wealth, with real wealth. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Berkeley</span></span>, Querist,
1735, teaches that the real notion of money is not that of a <span class="tei tei-q">“commodity, standard,

and transfer such power.”</span> (441, 475.) Even if the names, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">livre</span></span>,

I, 86 f., calls money, simply a means to put commodities, which alone have value
originally, in circulation. Hence it is, in itself, a matter of indifference
whether, for a given quantity of coin, a person gives one thaler, or ten. In
the Elements de Commerce, I, 11, II, 67 ff., he draws a distinction between
<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">richesses naturelles</span></span> (raw

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">von Schlözer</span></span>, Aufangsgründe, 1805, 100,

Compare, however, Edinb. Review, Oct., 1808. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Oppenheim</span></span>, Die Natur
des Geldes, 1855, grants that in the beginnings of trade, money possessed the
character of a commodity; but says that as soon as the services of circulation of the
money-commodity prevailed over its services in consumption, it
lost all its importance for the latter purpose, and that all relations dependent
thereon ceased. At present, he claims money is only the representative of
commodities, but no commodity itself. See, on the other hand,

4 ff. This true doctrine was acclimated earliest in England and Holland, and
before the mercantile system invaded them. Compare <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hobbes</span></span>,
Leviathan, 24, in which the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">concoctio

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Salmasius</span></span>, De Usuris (1638), who, among other
things, shows how Midas, who turned everything into bread, died of thirst.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Petty</span></span> shows very clearly that national wealth does not consist
exclusively nor mainly in money. Every country, he says, needs a certain quantity of
money to carry on trade. It would be a waste to increase the former, the
latter remaining the same. But the precious metals, by reason of their durability
and universally recognized value, possess the character of wealth in
a higher degree than other commodities.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On the whole, the use of money in a nation is like the use of fat in the
individual. (Quantulumcunque concerning Money, 1682.) Compare
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Roscher</span></span>, z. Geschichte der eng. Volkswirthschaftslehre, 80 f.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Davanzati</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hobbes</span></span> had compared it to

Compare <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Locke</span></span>, Considerations on the Lowering of Interest, 1691,
Works II, 13 ff., 19. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Galiani</span></span>, 1750, Della Moneta, IV, holds a
very happy middle place between the alchymists and the philosophic contemners of gold.
See, further, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Quesnay, éd. Daire</span></span>, 64, 75 ff.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Turgot</span></span>, Sur la Formation des Richesses, § 30 ff, had many clear
views on this subject. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Verri</span></span>, Meditazioni, 1771, II,
1, calls money the universally current commodity. The expressions, measure
of value, pledge, representative of all commodities might be true also
of all other wares. It cannot, however, be denied that most modern political
economists have not borne sufficiently in mind the peculiarities which distinguish
money from all other commodities, as is apparent from the doctrine
of the balance of trade prevalent in Hume's and Adam Smith's time. To
this extent, therefore, the semi-mercantilistic reaction instituted by
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ganilh</span></span>, Théorie de l'Economie politique, 2822, II, 380 ff., 426;

and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Colton</span></span>, Public Economy for the United States, 1849, 203 ff.,
who bring into relief the difference between <span class="tei tei-q">“money as the subject”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“money
as the instrument of trade,”</span> was not wholly unfounded. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ad.
Müller</span></span> exaggerates a correct thought, and causes it to degenerate into a species
of mystic pleasantry, when he calls every individual in the state and every commodity
that possesses value, in exchange or a social character, money.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The highest object of the state is to develop this money-character more
and more. (Elemente der Staatskunst, II, 194, 199.) The statesman, he
says, should be money. (III, 206.) A very valuable monograph on this
subject is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">M. Chevalier's</span></span> De la Monnaie, 1850, constituting the
third volume of his Cours d'Economie polititique. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Knies</span></span>, Geld
und Credit, I, 1873, is here most thorough and acute, especially in keeping separate, by
well defined lines of demarcation, the five different functions of money: measure of
value (by proper division into parts: price-measure), instrument of exchange, means of
transportation of values, and means of storing up and preserving values.

legal tender by the state, although of only secondary importance, is by no means an
irrelevant matter, since persons must then have it, even if they do not want it for
purposes of use or exchange, to discharge their liabilities thereby etc., etc. (Tübinger,
Zetschrift, 1858, 272.)

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In all these cases, barter-economy (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">Naturalwirthschaft</span></span>) meets with greater
and greater difficulties as civilization advances. How, for instance, could 50
days annually of socage-service or labor be redeemed by the achievement at
one time of 1,000 days of socage-service or labor? The rich man requires
money principally as a means of payment, the poor man as a medium of exchange.
The requirement or need of a people of media of payment is much
more susceptible of extension or contraction, than that of media of exchange,
made especially so by the intervention of claim-rights instead of money.

barter-economy and money-economy is of great and fundamental importance. It repeats
itself with so much regularity in the history of every highly developed nation, that
political economists gifted with perception for the historical, could not possibly
overlook it. Thus, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Aristotle</span></span>, for instance, establishes with the
utmost care and accuracy the difference between οἰκονομικὴ and χρηματιστικὴ, that is,
between natural economy and artificial economy, corresponding to the difference between
value in use and value in exchange. (Polit., I, 3, Schn.) Similarly <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">D.
Hume</span></span>, who allows a period of luxury, culture, industry, of trade and manufactures,
of freedom and circulation of money, to be preceded by one in which the feeling of wants
is not awakened, in which coarseness and idleness prevail, one in which
agriculture is alone pursued, and monetary economy and freedom decline,
and trade by barter obtains. (Discourses, passim, especially On Interest
and on Money.) A similar contrast we find frequently, and as one of his
fundamental thoughts, in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">J. Steuart</span></span>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As to how the transition from barter-economy to monetary-economy is
generally effected, see <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">F. G. Hoffmann</span></span>, Lehre vom Gelde, 1838,
176 ff. In the Tyrol, as late as 1820, the greater portion of purely mechanical work,
such as that of the smith, the carpenter, and the washerwoman, were purely
feudal duties. On the other hand, payment in money was the rule, in the
beginning of the fourteenth century. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">F. Beidermann</span></span>, Technische
Bildung in Oesterreich, 3.) Yet, for a long time after, the functions of a measure of
value were performed by pieces of land, and those of an instrument of exchange
by cattle and natural products. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Arnold, Gesch. des Eigenth</span></span>., 207.)
In France, money-economy, i.e., trade by money, had grown to importance
earlier. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Nitsch</span></span>., Ministerialität und Bürgerthum, im 11. und 12.

of length must necessarily have length itself. (We measure time on a
clock by means of the revolution of the hands on the dial.) Again, value
in exchange supposes value in use. The so-called <span class="tei tei-q">“money of account,”</span>
such as the East Indian <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">lac de roupies</span></span>, the Portuguese reis,
and the earlier English <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pound</span></span> sterling are no imaginary
magnitudes, which would disappear with the figures of our system of counting
(see <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hufeland</span></span>, N. Grundlegung, II, 33, in reply to

can not be represented by only single pieces of coin, units of value for the

Hence, such an acceptance always supposes the existence of a certain amount

for a long period of time in the frigid zones. Thus, the beaver-skin continues still to
be the unit of measure of trade in much of the territory of the Hudson Bay
Company. Three martens are estimated to be equal in value to one beaver,
one white fox to two beavers, one black fox or a bear to four beavers, a rifle

about a square inch in size, which were probably stamped by the government and redeemed
in whole skins at the government magazines. Hence, there is here supposed
a species of assignats, and of disturbances of credit. The Mongolian conquerors
would not recognize them, and they therefore became suddenly valueless.
In Novgorod and Pskow, the system continued some time longer,
for the reason that these places had little trade with the Mongols. In the
rest of the kingdom it now became necessary to introduce silver money, and
in the north to return to real squirrel and beaver skins.

Generally it is estimated that the furnace should yield 30 per cent. In the
copper mines of Mansfield, Norway, Agordo and Venice, it goes as low as
from one to three per cent. On the other hand, silver mines which yield 0.17
per cent. of metal are considered worth working. Lastly, gold is so rare that
generally it can be extracted only from time to time by the ordinary mining
processes. As a rule, men are content to gather it where nature has charged

instrument of exchange in as high a degree as gold and silver,—great value in
exchange, great specific gravity and great durability. On the other hand, its pliability
as to form is very small, and therefore the cost of coining it would be high.
The conversion of platinum coins into utensils, and of utensils into coin,
which would contribute to the supply of money when needed, and to a
diminution of that supply when the demand decreased, would be much more
difficult on this account; and also because of the small degree of beauty
possessed by that metal, which renders it little adapted to purposes of luxury.
Under these circumstances, the rarity in nature of the metal is a great drawback;
for the discovery of a new mine would create a great perturbation in
prices. For this reason, the Russian platinum coins have been generally
very much undervalued since 1828 in the commercial world, and the whole
experiment was given up in 1845-46. Compare <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">J. Schòn</span></span>, National

views on money are, in part, excellent. Thus, for instance, he
says that the debasement of the coin from financial necessity is as great a
folly as it would be to try to enlarge a piece of goods too small for the purpose
for which it was intended, by diminishing the length of the yard-stick.
(Sur l'Usage des Monnaies, 697.) A country entirely isolated from all others
could get along as well with one hundred pounds sterling as with a million.
(Money and Trade, p. 88.) Elsewhere, he confounds money and capital to
such a degree that he considers every increase of the amount of money in a
country as an enrichment of the people, a means to give employment to the
poor, to carry on manufactures etc. (Money and Trade, 23, 26 ff., 168.) A
given quantity of money is capable of giving employment at most only to
a certain number of men. (21.) A nation's power and wealth depend on
the population and its stores of goods, these on commerce, and commerce in
turn on the amount of money. (Pp. 110, 220.) The advice given, in 1848,
to the National Assembly of France, but which it had the good sense to

was not entirely clear, in his own mind, on this point. Thus
inconsistently enough, he calls money unproductive—<span class="tei tei-q">“dead stock,”</span> for the
reason that it leaves no material traces behind it of the goods which it has
transferred from one hand to another. (II, ch. 2.) Is not the same true of
trade itself? And yet Adam Smith calls trade productive. His error is
doubtless a remnant of the Physiocratic doctrine, to which Smith still held.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Twiss</span></span> says that money employed as
money is unproductive, but that, when employed as a commodity, it is productive.
(View of the Progress of Political Economy, since the sixteenth

has served the purposes of production, it comes out of the product unaltered.
The same is true of quicksilver employed in amalgamation.

good or bad result of this production depends on many different elements
which may compensate on another. In California and Australia gold
is to be found in large quantities, and is easily mined; but the workmen
make large demands which the nature of the country renders it difficult to
meet. In the Harz mines, where the cost is scarcely covered,
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lehzen</span></span>, Hannover's
Staatshaushalt, 1853, I, 139), the shafts are sometimes 175-½ fathoms
deep, but this is made up for in a measure by the moderate demands of the
workmen and their skill in mining. Among the Mandingos, the auriferous
material is so rich that ⅓ per 1,000 of the weight of the sand is washed out into
pure gold in ten minutes (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">M. Park</span></span>, Journal, 53 ff.,

still considered worth working. But then, what workmen there are there! In Peru, the
burdensome height of the mines above the level of the sea and the want of
combustible material more than counterbalance many favorable advantages,
while in Norway the cheapness of wood compensates for a great many disadvantages.
Another thing which contributes towards the uniformity of
the price of the precious metals is the circumstance that the great amount
of fixed capital required in the greater number of mining enterprises, postpones
for a long time the working of good mines as well as the abandonment

to the amount of about £5,000,000 would not raise prices nor increase the
tendency to speculation, but only enlarge the deposits of the bankers. But,
if on the other hand, £5,000,000, by any sudden contingency, were to be put
into the hands of the working classes, this money would, for the most part,
enter immediately into circulation; the price of commodities would, therefore,
rise and continue to rise until that amount had come into closer fists, as
it would after some time.

with that of corn, was lowered by the great extension of the artificial
cultivation of meadows; for, when the former has reached its maximum, it
becomes a great spur to the promotion of the latter. Thus, in England, the
price of meat, at the beginning of the sixteenth century, was on an average,
higher than in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Adam Smith's</span></span> time. (loc. cit.) To the same cause is

As a common basis for such calculations, the following may be accepted.
It is plain that meadows, pasturages and forage-fields must yield as much in
meat, as corn-fields of the same dimensions of equal goodness, and situated
as favorably, in corn. According to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Block</span></span>, a Prussian acre
(<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">Morgen</span></span>) of the
best quality, used as a meadow, produces a hay-value equal to 1,000 pounds,
a clover-value equal to 2,420; as a vegetable field, a beet or potato-value equal
to 6,050-6,930 pounds, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">v. Lengerke's</span></span> estimate is that 110 pounds
of cattle-fodder expressed in terms of hay, produces on an average 40 pounds of milk,
and from 3-½ to 4 pounds of meat. This would, at most, give 36, 88 and 220-252 pounds of
meat. The yield of wheat, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">v. Lengerke</span></span> estimates, on the best soil,
and on an average, at 14 Prussian <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">scheffels</span></span> (at 80 pounds, i.e. 1,120

that the source of the production of sea-fish, the ocean, which may be claimed at any

of gold and silver ware, besides the quantity intended for gilding
and silver-washing purposes. (Quart. Rev., April, 1866, 381.) The jewelers
of New York manufacture yearly 3,000,000 of dollars worth of gold and
silver ware, mostly new material. (Economist, April 16, 1853.) There were

time of Philip IV. (ob. 1314.) Cours, II, 322. How great a number of coins, especially
of the smaller denominations, are entirely lost is evident from the fact, that at the
time of the demonetization of the 15-sous and 30-sous pieces of 1791-92, amounting to
25,000,000, only 16,000,000 were presented for redemption. Of the 10-centime
pieces stamped with an N, amounting to 3,286,932 francs, there were only
2,000,000 left when they were withdrawn from circulation, and this although
individuals had added to the coinage. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">M. Chevalier</span></span>, III, 321.)
The total loss caused on this score, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">McCulloch</span></span> estimates at 1 per

aggregate stock of gold and silver, the greater the absolute amount of wear and tear.
If, therefore, there were annually an equal influx of mineral products to the markets,
the pressure of this increase of supply from that cause alone would take the shape of a

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">M. Chevalier</span></span>, all the mines of the world, a short time previous
to 1865, produced 284,000 kilogrammes of gold, and 190,000 kilogrammes of silver in a
year: a total of 373,000 thalers (Journal des Economistes, June, 1866), while, in
1848, the total amount of gold coinage in the world was estimated at 560,000,000;
Great Britain, France, North America and Sidney had, since that
time and up to 1871, added to this £597,780,000. The additions have been
made in decreasing quantities: thus, 1857-59, 37.2 millions annually; 1869-71,
16.99 millions annually. (Statist. Journ., 1872, 376 ff.) The estimates as to
how much a gold-digger might make in a day have been variously estimated.
Thus, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Larkin</span></span> estimates it from $25 to $50;
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mason</span></span>, at $10; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Folson</span></span>, at $25 to
$40; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Butler King</span></span>, at $16, reckoning one ounce at $16. All these
estimates seem to give an altogether too high average. In Australia, according to
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Khull</span></span>, Colonial Review, June, 1853, a digger can produce only one
ounce daily, or less than 4 thalers. According to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">W. Stamer</span></span>,
Recollections of a Life of Adventure, II, 1866, a gold-washer in Victoria earned in
1858, on an average, £250 per year; in 1865, only £70; while day labor was worth 15
shillings. Hence, great hopes have to be built on the lottery-nature of gold-washing.
On the Rhine, a gold-washer is satisfied with ⅔ of a gramme of
gold, that is worth from 13 to 18 silver groschens. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Daubrée</span></span>,
Comptes rendus de l' Académie des Sciences, XXII, 639.) It should be borne in mind,
however, that the Rhine-lander devotes to gold-washing only the leisure time
which his avocation as a fisherman leaves him, while the gold-washer in the
new world, as a rule, devotes his whole time to it; and that his labors are interrupted
by the long rainy season, attacks of fever etc. To this must be
added the great difference of the average prices of the means of subsistence
and the difference of all social conditions.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a href="#noteref_863" id="note_863" class="pginternal">863.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext"><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Compare, for instance, on the early

Hitherto, gold had been obtained by the usual mining process, only in very
few places. As a rule, it has been found in alluvial land not far from the
surface. Compare <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ansted</span></span>, The Gold-Seekers' Manual, 1849. These
circumstances have made the production of gold important from the first; and
they still make it comparatively easy, while it causes little demand for capital
but for great skill. As soon, therefore, as the greater part of the country
washed for gold has been worked, which does not require a long time, the
whole is abandoned, while in the production of silver the great amount of
capital fixed in pits, shafts, kilns etc. ties the parties engaged in the enterprise
to the spot, and necessitates the continuation of the enterprise. In recent
times, however, Australia and California have developed the mining and
machine production of gold to a surprising extent. According to
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Laur</span></span>, La Production des Métaux précieux en Californie, 1862, 33,

on an average, 635 francs per ton; in 1860, only from 80 to 85 francs; but the
gold-washing methods have become cheaper in the ratio of 2,500:1. However,
the production of the precious metals seems even now to be decreasing.

Shortly before each term for the payment of interest, the circulation of such

the rate of interest such notes bore, they would be sought after eagerly and
disappear in quantities, and, not be ever seen again until the rate of discount
had risen to a high figure, when they would be suddenly presented for redemption.
Such interest-bearing paper money, therefore, would be a serious
element to aggravate the fluctuations of the money-market between good

the highest <span class="tei tei-q">“normal course of exchange”</span> was 71, and the lowest 27 per cent. In
January, 1815, a refusal to take them at par, except in certain cases, was
threatened with from 500 to 1,000 thalers of a money-fine or from 6 to 12

added as a penalty. This penalty, reduced in 1827 to 1 silver groschen,
was not formally abolished even in 1870, although it had long fallen into disuetude.
There was a run of the owners of the notes in 1830, for redemption,

hence the former is the more usual. It was provided in Austria on the 22d

variations in the political state of affairs than by the changes in its volume.

650,000,000 paper rubles circulated, with scarcely any increase or decrease;

on metallic-currency countries. (Tüb. Zeitschr., 422.) Good paper
money will never drive out the whole supply of cash money out of a country,
because a good portion must always be kept for purposes of redemption;
depreciated paper money operates much farther in this direction. Even the
exportation of small change may become a profitable speculation as soon as
the amount of depreciation of paper money exceeds the seigniorage. Then
usually small change of a worse kind is stamped, as, for instance, in Austria,
copper instead of silver; and in 1860, 12 millions florins of paper small
change. Here the exportation of the better money is not a consequence, but

the calculation was based on the recent depreciated value of the assignats;
in the case of the latter, on the higher value the assignats had at the moment
that the contract was concluded. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Büsch</span></span>, Geldumlauf, III, 62.) A
writer in the Revue des deux Mondes, April 15, 1865, thinks that one reason why
the American civil war was so popular in the northwest was because the
paper money issued during the rebellion made it easy for that part of the
country to pay off the mortgage-debts which had burthened it since 1848.

200 florins in a new kind of paper. The holders of the old paper money have

unfrequently happens that a nation's paper money has been directly
or indirectly affected by an unfriendly state. Thus for instance, England, in
1794, tolerated an assignat manufactory at Lambeth, while Frenchmen imitated
English bank notes. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Archenholz</span></span>, Aenalen XI, 429.) Napoleon in
1812 issued forged Russian bank notes. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cancrin</span></span>, Œconomie der
menschl. Gesellschaft, 136. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Niebuhr</span></span>, Gesch. der Revolution, II,
314.) When Maria Theresa first wished to introduce paper money, Bolza, her minister of
finance, in his urgent appeal to her to desist from adopting such a measure,
foretold the subsequent bankruptcy etc. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mailath</span></span>, Oesterr.
Gesch., V., 83.) <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Adam Smith</span></span> compares gold and silver circulation
to a highway which, indeed, produces nothing directly. Paper money is an advance similar
to that which would be produced by the construction of a machine adapted to the
carriage of persons and goods through the air, and which permit the highways
hitherto used to be turned into meadows, arable land etc. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ad. Smith</span></span>
very strongly emphasizes the insecurity of these <span class="tei tei-q">“Dædalian wings”</span> as compared
with the <span class="tei tei-q">“solid ground of gold and silver,”</span> especially in the transitory
misfortune produced by war. (W. of N., II, p. 78, Bas.) <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">David Hume</span></span>
says of all paper media of exchange, that they share all the harmfulness of an increase
of specie money, enhancement of the price of commodities, aggravation
of the obstacles to exportation; but that they do not share in the useful
properties of specie money. (Discourses, On Money and on the Balance of
Trade.) The younger <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mirabeau</span></span> kept Necker from pursuing his plan
to issue paper money with the words: <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">du
papier monnaie c'est la peste circulante!</span></span> Inconsistent
as Napoleon was in his bank policy (compare <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Horn</span></span>, Bankfreiheit,
304), he always rejected paper money. As in 1805 he wrote to the minister
of justice: <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">je ne veut pas de papier
monnaie</span></span>: so, in opposition to the minister of the interior, he in 1810
compared it to the plague: <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">le plus
grandfléau des nations</span></span>. (Acad. des Sciences m. et p., 1864, II, 212.)
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sismondi</span></span>, too, compares paper money to the paper cannons of the
Chinese, which render a cheap service until the hour of danger comes. (N. Principles,
II, 107.) Of the banks he says: <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">les
avantages aussi-legers les dangers aussi graves</span></span>. (Eludes,
II. 421). <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cancrin</span></span>, Œkonomie der menschl. Gesellschaft, 1845, 152
ff., says he thinks that possibly it might have been well never to have established
banks, but that yet the craving for the new is preponderately good, it brings
inventions and improvements with it. Even <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tooke</span></span> considers the
insecurity of paper money a disadvantage which more than counterbalances its cheapness.
(Considerations on the State of the Currency, 1829, 85.) On the
doubts of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Jefferson</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gallatin</span></span>, see
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Wolowski</span></span>, Enquête, 170, seq. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Webster</span></span>
called paper money <span class="tei tei-q">“the most effectual of inventions to fertilize the rich
man's field by the sweat of the poor man's brow.”</span> <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">Tout papier monnaie par lui même est un mensonage.</span></span>
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">M. Chevalier</span></span>, Cours, III, 428.) <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">M.
Niebuhr</span></span> calls banks a poison which should be used with moderation. (Bankrevolution

All debts had to be paid within two years, or to be held invalid, and juries
were dispensed with in such cases. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ebeling</span></span>, Gesch. und

compares <span class="tei tei-q">“cosmopolitan”</span> metallic money to a universal language:
paper money ties one to the country, as people do not like to travel
in foreign parts when they understand only their native language. As paper
money compels subjects to take an interest in the state, a state like Austria
would act very foolishly if it should begin its reorganization by enhancing
its depreciated values (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Valuta</span></span>). (Elemente der Staatskunst, 180,
III, 171; II, 339 ff.) Even in 1830, he found fault with the Austrian loan for the payment
of the paper money. (Briefwechsel mit Gentz, 321 seq.) He lauded
paper money because he claimed it led a country back to the barter And
service-economy of the middle ages. (Verm. Schriften, I, 59 ff.) Similarly,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gentz</span></span>, in his later writings. Compare

all paper money, see <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Stephan</span></span>, Ægypten, 250 seq. This is all the
more surprising since during several months after the harvest, there are from 4,000,000
to 8,000,000 piasters in specie sent every day from Alexandria by post to
private individuals in the provinces. In addition to this there is the immense
difference in the French, English and Austrian coins circulating in the country,
and which have very different rates in the different provinces. It is still

recognized as such, would find credit everywhere. Thus, English businessmen
have outstanding claims in all parts of the world, which might without
any great difficulty be called in in the precious metals. The more the
division of labor is developed, the better may the condition of a nation's
whole economy be seen reflected in the course of its banking system and its

        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has

    </li>
    <li>• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

forth in Section 3 below.
</div><div>
1.F.
</div><div>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div><div>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div><div>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div><div>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

</div><div>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div><div>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.
</div><div>
The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
