<p class="p2 center"><a id="S144"></a>SECTION CXLIV.</p>
<p class="center smaller">RECEIPTS.—INCOME.—PRODUCE.</p>
<p>The idea covered by the word receipts (<i>Einnahme</i>) embraces all the
new additions successively made to one's resources within a given period of
time.<a id="fnanchor_144-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_144-1">[144-1]</a> Income, on the
other hand, embraces only such receipts as are the results of economic
activity. (See §§ 2, 11.) Produce (<i>Ertrag</i>, <i>produit</i>) is
income, but not from the point of view of the person or <i>subject</i>
engaged in a business of any kind, but from that of the business itself, or
of the <i>object</i> with which the business is concerned, and on which it,
so to speak, acts.</p>
<p>Income is made up of products, the results of labor and of the
employment and use of resources. These products, the producer may either
consume himself or exchange against other products, to satisfy a more
urgent want.<a id="fnanchor_144-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_144-2">[144-2]</a> Hence, spite
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 2]</span> of the frequency with which we hear
such expressions as these: "the laborer eats the bread of his employer;"
"the capitalist lives by the sweat of the brow of labor;" or, again, a
manufacturer or business man "lives from the income of his customers,"<a id="fnanchor_144-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_144-3">[144-3]</a> they are entirely unwarranted. No man who
manages his own affairs well, or those of a household, lives on the capital
or income of another man; but every one lives on his own income, by the
things he has himself produced; although with every further development of
the division of labor, it becomes rarer that any one puts the finishing
stroke to his own products, and can satisfy himself by their immediate
consumption alone. Hence we should call nothing diverted or derived income
except that which has been gratuitously obtained from another.<a id="fnanchor_144-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_144-4">[144-4]</a></p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_144-1"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_144-1" class="pginternal">[144-1]</a>
 Including of course, gifts, inheritances, lottery prizes, etc.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_144-2"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_144-2" class="pginternal">[144-2]</a> Thus the original income of the
 peasant consists in his corn, of the miller in his flour, of the baker in
 his bread, of the shoemaker in his shoes. The money which circulates among
 all these and the purchaser, is only the means of exchanging that part of
 their products which they cannot themselves use, for other goods. Money,
 on the other hand, was the original income of the producers of the gold or
 silver it contains. Compare <i>Mirabeau</i>, Philosophie rurale, 1763, ch.
 3. <i>Adam Smith</i>, II, ch. 2. But especially, see <i>J. B. Say</i>,
 Traité II, ch. 1, 5; and <i>Sismondi</i>, N. P., I, 90, 376, in which it
 is correctly said, that the quality which constitutes anything capital or
 income does not inhere in the thing itself, but depends on the person.
 Compare, however, I, 148; <i>Hermann</i>, Staatsw. Untersuch. 297 ff., 33
 seq.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_144-3"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_144-3" class="pginternal">[144-3]</a>
 A fundamental thought in <i>St. Chamans</i>, Du Système d'Impôt, 1820.
 Nouvel Essai sur la Richesse des Nations, 1824.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_144-4"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_144-4" class="pginternal">[144-4]</a>
 Thus, for instance, the support given by the head of a family to the
 members thereof; also gifts, alms, thefts. Even <i>A. L. Schlözer</i>, St.
 A., II, 487, will allow that no one "eats the bread of another," but the
 person who has received it from the latter by way of favor and for
 nothing. In the case of a rented house, there is only an exchange of
 objects of income. The person to whom it is rented gives up a portion of
 his, and the renting party the use of his house. Similarly, in the case of
 personal services. Writers who maintain that only certain kinds of useful
 labor are productive, must of course extend the limits of diverted income
 much farther. See <i>Lotz</i>, Handbuch, III, § 133; <i>Rau</i>, Lehrbuch,
 I, §§ 248, 251. <i>Cantillon</i> thinks that if no landowner spent more
 than his income, it would be scarcely possible for any one else to grow
 rich. (Nature du Commerce, 75.) According to <i>Stein</i>, Lehrbuch, 347,
 every one gets his income from the income of other people!</p>
<p class="p2 center"><a id="S145"></a>SECTION CXLV.</p>
<p class="center smaller">INCOME.—GROSS, FREE AND NET.</p>
<p>In all <i>income</i>, we may distinguish a <i>gross</i> amount, a
<i>net</i> amount and a <i>free</i> amount.<a id="fnanchor_145-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_145-1">[145-1]</a> The gross income of a year, for <span class="pagenum">[Pg 3]</span> instance, consists of all the goods which
have been newly produced within that time. The net<a id="fnanchor_145-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_145-2">[145-2]</a> income is that portion of the former which remains
after deducting the cost of production (§ 106), and which may therefore be
consumed without diminishing the original resources. Only the new values
incorporated in the new commodities make up the net income. Evidently, a
great portion of what is considered in one business the cost of production
is net income in a great many others; as for instance, what the person
engaged in one enterprise in production has paid out in wages and interest
on capital. By means of this outlay, a portion of his circulating capital
is drawn by others as income, and, on the other hand, a portion of their
original income is turned into a portion of his circulating capital.<a id="fnanchor_145-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_145-3">[145-3]</a> <i>Free</i> income, I call that portion of net
income which remains available to the producer after his indispensable
wants have been satisfied.</p>
<p>An accurate kind of book-keeping which keeps these three elements of
income separate is more generally practicable<a id="fnanchor_TN1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN1">[TN 1]</a> as
civilization advances. We might call it the <i>economic balance</i>. Where
commerce is very thriving it is even customary to provide by law that those
classes who need it especially should have this species of book-keeping.
People in a lower stage of cultivation, with their poetical nature, are
unfriendly to such calculations.<a id="fnanchor_145-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_145-4">[145-4]</a> <a id="fnanchor_145-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_145-5">[145-5]</a> And where natural-economy (<i>Naturalwirtschaft</i>)
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 4]</span> or barter prevails, a book-keeping of
this kind of any accuracy is scarcely practicable. The ratio which net
income bears to gross income is a very important element to enable us to
judge of the advantageousness of any method of production. If every
producer should succeed in consequence of keeping his books in this manner,
in determining exactly the cost to him of each of his products, this would
be an economic <span class="pagenum">[Pg 5]</span> progress similar to that
of general spread of good chemical knowledge in the arts. On the amount of
<i>free</i> income, on the other hand, depends all the higher enjoyment of
life, all rational beneficence, and the progressive enrichment of
mankind.<a id="fnanchor_145-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_145-6">[145-6]</a></p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_145-1"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_145-1" class="pginternal">[145-1]</a>
 Similarly in <i>Sismondi</i>, N. P., II, 330, and <i>Rau</i>, Lehrbuch, I,
 § 71, a.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_145-2"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_145-2" class="pginternal">[145-2]</a>
 Called by <i>Hermann</i>, loc. cit., simply income.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_145-3"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_145-3" class="pginternal">[145-3]</a>
 This truth <i>J. B. Say</i> has exaggerated to the extent of claiming that
 gross and net income are one and the same so far as entire nations are
 concerned. (Traité, II, ch. 5; Cours pratique, III, 14; IV, 74.) But the
 gross profit of the entire production of any one year is much greater than
 the simultaneous net income of all the individuals engaged in it. This is
 accounted for by the fact that in such production an amount of circulating
 capital is invested which was saved from the net profit of previous
 economic times. Compare <i>Storch</i>, Nationaleinkommen, 90 ff.
 <i>Kermann</i>, loc. cit., 323 ff.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_145-4"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_145-4" class="pginternal">[145-4]</a>
 In the East, a valuation by one's self of his property is considered a
 guilty kind of pride, usually punished by the loss of one's possessions.
 (<i>Burckhardt</i>, Travels in Arabia, I, 72 ff.) See <i>Samuel</i>, 24,
 on the census made by David. The Egyptians, however, as may be inferred
 from their monuments, must have very early and very extensively felt the
 want of some kind of book-keeping such as we have mentioned. A very
 accurate sort of book-keeping among the more highly<a id="fnanchor_TN2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN2">[TN
 2]</a> cultured Romans, with a daily memorandum and a monthly book with
 entries from the former (<i>adversaria-tabula expensi et accepti</i>).
 Compare <i>Cicero</i>, pro Roscio, com. 2, 3; pro Cluent, 30;
 <i>Verr.</i>, II, 1, 23, 36. The Latin <i>putare</i>, from <i>putus</i>,
 pure, means: to make an account clear, and therefore corresponds to the
 American provincialism, "I reckon," i. e., I believe; and is a remarkable
 proof of a rigid method of keeping accounts. The Italian, or so-called
 double-entry method of book-keeping, which gives the most accurate
 information on the profit from every separate branch of business, became
 usual among the nations of modern Europe whose civilization was the first
 to ripen, about the end of the fifteenth century. Its invention is
 ascribed to the monk Luca Paciolo di Borgo S. Sepolcro.</p>
<p class="footnote">In England, this kind of book-keeping is very
 gradually coming into use even among farmers, while <i>Simond</i>, Voyage
 en Angleterre, 2 ed., II, 64, <i>Dunoyer</i>, Liberté du Travail, VIII, 5,
 say, "it would in France be considered as ridiculous as the book-keeping
 of an apple vendor." In Germany, there have been for some time past,
 manufactories of commercial books. Besides, the remarkable difference
 brought out by the income tax in England between the exact statements made
 by large manufacturers, etc., and by those engaged in industry on a medium
 or small scale, bears evidence of the better way in which the former keep
 their accounts, the cause and effect of their better business in general.
 Compare <i>Knies</i>, in the Tübing. Zeitschr., 1854, 513. On the best
 mode of determining income, see <i>Cazaux</i>, Eléments d'Économie
 publique et privée, Livre, II. It is especially necessary to keep an
 account of the increase or diminution, even when accidental, of the value
 of the fixed capital employed.</p>

 The Code de Commerce, I, art. 8, requires that every merchant should keep
 a journal, paged and approved by the authorities, showing the receipts and
 disbursements of each day, on whatever account, and also the monthly
 expenditures of his family. Besides, he is required to make a yearly
 inventory of his debits and credits, subscribe to it and preserve it. That
 such books were excellent judicial evidence may be shown by Italian
 statutes of the fourteenth century. (<i>Martens</i>, Ursprung des

<p>Among the most important<a id="fnanchor_146-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_146-1">[146-1]</a>
but also the most difficult objects of statistics, that book-keeping of
nations, is national income. In estimating it, we may take our starting
point from the goods which are elements of income, or from the persons who
receive them as income.<a id="fnanchor_146-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_146-2">[146-2]</a></p>
<p>In the former case the gross national income consists:</p>
<p>A. Of the raw material newly obtained in the country.</p>
<p>B. Of imports from foreign countries, including that which is secured by
piracy, as war-booty, contributions, etc.</p>
<p>C. The increase of values which industry<a id="fnanchor_146-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_146-3">[146-3]</a> and commerce <span class="pagenum">[Pg 6]</span> add
to the first two classes up to the time of their final consumption.</p>
<p>D. Services in the narrower sense and the produce (<i>Nutzungen</i>) of
capital in use.</p>
<p>All these several elements, estimated at their average price in money,
which supposes that all purchases, especially those under the head D, are
made voluntarily<a id="fnanchor_146-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_146-4">[146-4]</a> and at their
natural price.</p>
<p>To find the national net income, we must deduct the following items:</p>
<p>A. All the material employed in production which yields no immediate
satisfaction to any personal want.<a id="fnanchor_146-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_146-5">[146-5]</a></p>
<p>B. The exports which pay for the imports.</p>
<p>C. The wear and tear of productive capital and capital in use.</p>
<p>In the second case the net national income is to be calculated from the
following items:</p>
<p>A. From the net income of all independent private businesses etc.<a id="fnanchor_146-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_146-6">[146-6]</a></p>
<p>B. From the net income of the state, of municipalities, <span class="pagenum">[Pg 7]</span> corporations and institutions, derived from
their own resources.</p>
<p>C. Under the former heads must be taken into the account such parts of
property as have been immediately consumed and enjoyed.<a id="fnanchor_146-7"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_146-7">[146-7]</a></p>
<p>D. Interest on debt must be added only on the side of the creditor, and
deducted from the income of the debtor; otherwise, <i>error dupli</i>. This
does not apply to taxes or church dues because the subjects of a good state
and members of a good church purchase thereby things which are really new
and of at least equal value to the outlay. Besides, in both instances, it
is necessary to calculate the number of men who live from the national
income, the average amount of their indispensable wants, and the average
price in money of the same, in order to determine the <i>free</i> national
income by deducting the sum total of these average wants, estimated at this
average price.<a id="fnanchor_146-8"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_146-8">[146-8]</a> <a id="fnanchor_146-9"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_146-9">[146-9]</a></p>

 judging of the comfort of the people, their control of natural forces,
 etc.; the second, of the relation of classes among the people. (<i>v.
 Mangoldt</i>, Grundriss, 99. V. W. L., 316 ff.) Each member of the nation
 produces his income only in the whole of the nation's economy. Hence

 because, for instance, almost all technic progress decreases the
 appreciation of values through industry, and every advance made by luxury
 raises the claims to refined quality etc. See <i>Hildebrand</i>,

 Many items in Class D evade all calculation. Thus, for instance, the
 numberless cases of personal services which are enjoyed only by the doer
 himself; also the greater number of products (<i>Nutzungen</i>=usufruct)
 of capital in use for the consumption of the owner himself. (Latent
 income.) Only, it may be, in the case of dwelling houses, equipages, etc.,
 that the consumption by use can be estimated in accordance with the

 When an artist who earns $10,000 per annum appears in a country, the gross
 national income increases in a way similar to that in which it increases
 when a new commodity is found which would have a yearly increase of value
 equal to $10,000 over and above that of the raw material. Cost of
 production in the case of such a virtuoso is scarcely to be alluded to.
 Nearly his entire income, with the exception of his traveling expenses,

 The gross income of British Europe is estimated by <i>Pebrer</i>, Histoire
 financière et statistique générale de l'Empire Br., 1834, II, 90, at
 £514,823,059, viz.: agriculture, £246,600,000; mining, 21,400,000;
 manufactures, after deduction made of the raw material, £148,050,000;
 internal and coast trade, £51,975,060; foreign commerce and navigation,
 £34,398,059; banking, £4,500,000; interest from foreign countries,
 £4,500,000. By <i>Moreau de Jonnés</i>, Statist de la Gr. Br., 1837, I,
 312, it is estimated at 18,000,000,000 francs, from which, however, the
 raw material used in industry is not deducted. The net income of Great
 Britain was estimated by Pitt, in 1799, at £135,000,000, of which
 £25,000,000 were received by landowners for rent, £25,000,000 by farmers,
 £5,000,000 were tithes, £3,000,000 from forests, canals, and mines,
 £6,000,000 from houses, £15,000,000 from state funds, £12,000,000 from
 foreign commerce, £28,000,000 from inland commerce and manufactures,
 £3,000,000 from fine arts, £80,000,000 from Scotland, £5,000,000 from
 foreign countries. (<i>Gentz</i>, Histor. Journ., 1799, I, 183 ff.)
 <i>Lowe</i>, England in its present Situation, 1822, p. 246, speaks of
 255,000,000. About 1860, the incomes subject to taxation alone, that is,
 all above £100, amounted to 335,000,000. The remainder was certainly worth
 one-half of this. (Statist. Journ., 1864, 121.) <i>Baxter</i>, in 1867,
 assumed it to be £825,000,000. Compare <i>L. Levi</i>, on Taxation, 6.</p>
<p class="footnote">In France, about forty years ago, according to
 Chaptal, Doudeauville, Balbi and others, about 6,500,000,000 francs gross
 national income could be counted on. <i>Schnitzler</i> speaks of
 7,000,000,000 francs (Creation de la Richesse en France, 1842, I, 392),
 after deduction made of the raw material of manufacture. According to
 <i>Wolowski</i>, Statistique de la Fr., 1847, it was more than
 12,000,000,000 francs. <i>M. Chevalier</i>, Revue des deux Mondes, March
 15, 1848, has it 10,000,000,000 at most. In these four estimates, only
 material products are taken into account. <i>Ch. Dupin</i> thinks the
 income per capita was, in 1730, = 108 francs; in 1780, = 169; in 1830, =
 269. <i>Cazeaux</i>, Eléments, 163, estimated the net national income, in
 1825, at 5,000,000,000 francs; <i>Cochut</i>, in 1861, at 16,000,000,000.

 mining, over $42,000,000; from lumber (<i>Wäldern</i>), almost
 $17,000,000; and from the fisheries, almost $12,000,000. The per capita
 amount of income was $62. It was largest in Rhode Island—$110; in
 Massachusetts it was $103; in Louisiana, $99; and in Iowa, smallest, $27;
 in Michigan, it was $33. Compare <i>Tucker</i>, Progress of the United
 States, 195 ff. The census of 1860 assumes the national wealth, slaves not
 included, at $14,183,000,000, that is $451 per capita, with a per capita
 annual income of $112. According to <i>Czörnig</i>, the gross income of
 Austria, from agriculture, the chase and fisheries, in 1861, was
 2,119,000,000 florins; from mining, 41,000,000; from the industries,
 1,200,000,000. In Prussia, the net national income, not including the
 revenue from state property, nor the income of the royal household, seems,

<p class="center smaller">NATIONAL INCOME.—ITS STATISTICAL
IMPORTANCE.<br>
(CONTINUED.)</p>
<p>The question frequently discussed, whether it is more advantageous to
increase the gross income or the net income<a id="fnanchor_147-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_147-1">[147-1]</a> of <span class="pagenum">[Pg 9]</span> a people, may
be readily answered with the assistance of our tripartite division. Since
economic production has no other object than the satisfaction of human
wants, the mere increase of the gross income of a people is a matter of
indifference. An increase of the net income puts a people in a condition to
increase either their numbers or their enjoyments. (See §§ 163 and 239.)
The most desirable condition is where both these results are produced. It
is fortunate for a people when the <i>free</i> income of the nation
increases by reason of the absolute or relative decrease of the cost of
production, which adds nothing to enjoyment. But it is politically and
morally to be lamented when it increases at the expense of the satisfaction
of man's necessary wants, especially if the majority of the people deny
themselves in this respect to produce that end. Sir Thomas More called the
sheep of his time, to make place for which so many farm houses were razed
to the ground, ravenous beasts, which devoured men and laid waste city and
country.<a id="fnanchor_147-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_147-2">[147-2]</a></p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_147-1"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_147-1" class="pginternal">[147-1]</a>
 The greater number of writers, at bottom, understand by this question only
 whether greater efforts should be made to increase the wages of the lower
 classes or the rent and rate of interest on capital paid to the higher.
 (<i>Schmoller</i>, in the Tüb. Zeitschrift, 1863, 22.)</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_147-2"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_147-2" class="pginternal">[147-2]</a>
 The difference between gross and net income was introduced into the
 science principally by the Physiocrates. <i>Vauban</i> (1707) had no
 conception of it, and thirty years later a French minister, in his
 instructions concerning the levy of the <i>vingtièmes</i>, dimly seeing
 that the aggregate amount of the harvest was not clear gain, ordered, to
 obtain the latter, that the cost of reaping and threshing should be
 deducted. (<i>Dupont</i>, Correspondence of <i>J. B. Say</i>, 404, éd.
 Daire.) By <i>produit net</i>, <i>Quesnay</i> means the excess of original
 production over its cost, considered from the personal point of view of
 the individual landowner. This excess, it is claimed, can alone increase
 the national wealth and alone support the "steril" class.</p>
<p class="footnote">The political and military bearing of this very
 clearly recognized. (102 ff., éd Daire.) Hence <i>Quesnay</i>, favors it
 in every way; by large farming instead of small, by stock raising on a
 large scale, supplanting home labor by cheaper foreign labor, by machinery
 and the employment of manual labor, etc.; 91 ff., 200 ff., 274 ff. The
 elder <i>Mirabeau</i> teaches even that the goodness of a government or of
 a constitution, and even national morality may be inferred from the amount
 of the <i>produit net</i>. (Ph. rurale, ch. 5.) <i>Stewart</i>,
 Principles, I, ch. 20. <i>Adam Smith</i> gives greater prominence to the
 gross income, and grades the principal branches of national labor
 according as they increase the gross product of the nation's economy. (II,
 chs. 1, 5.) Similarly, <i>J. B. Say</i>, Traité, ch. 8, § 3;
 <i>Lauderdale</i>, Inquiry, 142.</p>
<p class="footnote"><i>Ricardo</i> thoroughly reacts against this view,
 and considers it a matter of indifference whether a net product (interest
 on capital and rent) of a given amount be obtained by the labor of five or
 seven million other men, so long as only five million can live on it.
 (Principles, ch. 26.) Similarly <i>Ganilh</i>, Systèmes, I, 218 ff.;
 Théorie, II, 96. Controverted by <i>Malthus</i>, Principles, II, § 6.
 <i>Buquoy</i>, Theorie der Nat. Wirthsch., 1815, 310 ff. <i>Sismondi</i>
 has ridiculed this predilection for the net product which in
 <i>Ricardo</i> corresponds with what the Germans call free
 product (<i>freien Ertrage</i>), and which, contrary to Ricardo's own
 opinion, he calls Ricardo's ideal, saying that according to him, nothing
 more was to be desired but that "the king should remain alone on the
 island and, by turning a crank forever, do all the work of England through
 the instrumentality of automata." (N. P., II, 330 ff.) An entire people
 should value only gross product. (I, 183.) In his Etudes, Essai, II: Du
 Revenu Social, <i>Sismondi</i> distinguishes as elements of the gross
 national income: a, pure capital, the return of outlay; b, that which is
 at once both capital and income, and serves as family support (capital as
 a necessarily remaining supply, income as the product of the preceding
 year); c, net income, the excess of production over consumption.</p>
<p class="footnote">The Socialists of our day would prefer to see the
 whole net income of a people employed in the satisfaction of the necessary
 wants of an ever increasing population. By this procedure, as a natural
 consequence, we should witness first the curtailing of the taxing power,
 of the funds for the satisfaction of the more refined wants and of the
 saving of capital, nor would it be long before even the existing
 generation would experience the bitterness of this "living from hand to
 mouth." After a time, even the possibility of progress and even of mere
 increase of population would cease.</p>
<p class="footnote"><i>Hermann</i>, Staatsw. Untersuch., 297 ff., has
 better than almost any one else developed the theory of income, and he
 lays most stress on the satisfaction of wants as the chief aim of public
 economy. <i>Kröncke</i>, Das Steuerwesen, 1804, 381 ff.; Grundsätze einer
 gerechten Besteuerung, 1819, 93 f., may be considered the predecessor who
 prepared the way for him. Compare the profound work of <i>Bernhardi</i>,
 Versuch einer Kritik der Gründe die für grosses und kleines Grundeigenthum
 angeführt werden, St. Petersburg, 1848. Many controversies on this subject
 may be closed by a more accurate understanding as to terms. Thus, for
 instance, when <i>Rau</i>, Handbuch, embraces in the cost of production
 the necessary maintenance of material-workmen, and of those engaged in the
 labor of commerce; or when <i>Jacob</i>, Staatswissenschaft, § 496, and
 <i>Storch</i>, Einkommen, 116 ff., even the necessary support of every
 class useful to society, their valuation of the gross national income is
 in only apparent conflict with our doctrine on the subject.</p>
<p class="p2 center"><a id="S148"></a>SECTION CXLVIII.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 10]</span></p>
<p class="center smaller">THE TWO PHASES OF INCOME.</p>
<p>In every income which has anything to do with other incomes, it is
necessary to distinguish its immediately productive side, and its profit or
acquisition side. It is necessary, in the first place, that all the
products made by private parties should, so to speak, be put into the
common treasury of the national economy, and that each should thence draw
his own private revenue. Justice requires that there should be a perfect
correlation between the two; that each should enjoy precisely the quota of
the national income to the production of <span class="pagenum">[Pg
11]</span> which his person or his property contributed. A just
appreciation of the relative productive power of the divers branches of
labor constitutes one of the chief bulwarks against the inroads of
destructive socialistic theories. The person who calls a good doctor or a
good judge unproductive should, to be consistent, call those who by their
greater intelligence are fitted to superintend agricultural and industrial
enterprises unproductive, also, as is done by the coarser socialists with
their apotheosis of mere manual labor. Unfortunately, such a settlement as
is above contemplated among the different factors of production, whose
owners are desirous to divide the common product among them, is possible
only where the factors of production are either of the same kind, or can be
reduced to a common denominator.<a id="fnanchor_148-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_148-1">[148-1]</a>
But if justice pure and <span class="pagenum">[Pg 12]</span> simple were
meted out, no man could subsist. Love or charity must supplement justice in
order to assist those (and especially such as without any fault of theirs)
who are not able to produce anything, or enough to supply those wants, for
instance, children and the poor.</p>
<p>As the net national income, following the three great factors of all
economic production, is divided into three great branches, rent, wages and
interest on capital, the net income from any private business may be
reduced to one or more of these branches.<a id="fnanchor_148-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_148-2">[148-2]</a> The three great branches of income may be considered
with advantage from a great many different points of view. We may inquire
in the case of each of them: concerning its absolute magnitude, its
relation to the aggregate national income, to the magnitude of the factor
of production, of which it constitutes the remuneration; by what number of
men it is shared, and what number of wants it satisfies.<a id="fnanchor_148-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_148-3">[148-3]</a> Lastly, the difference between the amount
stipulated for, and <span class="pagenum">[Pg 13]</span> the original
amount of both rent and wages, as well as the interest of capital, is of
special importance. The former consists in the price paid by the borrower
for the use of the factor of production to the owner; the latter in the
immediate products which the employment of the same productive power brings
on one's own account. Evidently, the original amount is, in the long run,
the chief element in the determination of the stipulated amount. While the
former depends more on the deeper and more durably effective elements of
price, especially the cost of production, the value in use and the paying
capacity of purchasers; the latter is conditioned more by the superficial
variations of supply and demand, and even by custom. For our purposes, the
former is by far the more important, but, at the same time, by far the more
difficult to perceive.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_148-1"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_148-1" class="pginternal">[148-1]</a>
 This is possible between labor and capital, at least in so far as a
 comparison can be instituted between the sacrifice of human rest there is
 in labor and the sacrifice of enjoyment in the building up of capital. But
 the person who introduces an entirely unimproved piece of land into the
 service of production, stands to the laborer as well as to the capitalist
 in a relation which is entirely incomparable with any other. (See § 156.)
 The doctrine of former agriculturists, that one-half of the harvest was to
 be ascribed to the soil and the other to the manure, would not suffice
 here, even if it were correct. Compare <i>Fraas</i>, Gesch. der Landbau-
 und Forstwissenschaft, 257. But in the production of a calf, the
 coöperation of a bull and cow are necessary. Yet no one is in condition to
 determine what portion of the calf is to be accounted as belonging to
 either. If the bull and cow belong to different owners, the relation of
 supply and demand, and the deeper causes that determine them, decide in
 what proportion the value of the calf is to be divided among them.</p>

 Among the greatest services rendered by <i>Adam Smith</i> is, his complete
 demonstration, that any income may be resolved into one or more of the
 three great branches of the national income. (I, ch. 6.)</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_148-3"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_148-3" class="pginternal">[148-3]</a>
<i>Ricardo</i> has not unfrequently bewildered uncritical readers, by his
 habit—in which he is by no means always consistent—of using
 the expressions higher and lower wages, higher and lower profit of
 capital, to designate not the absolute greatness of these branches of
 income, either in money or in the wants of life, nor their greatness from
 a personal point of view, but only their relative greatness as compared
 with the aggregate income, the measure of the quota of the aggregate
 product which is divided among workmen, capitalists, etc. And yet, in the
 case of most economic questions, this is without doubt the less
 interesting side. Compare the polemic of <i>R. Jones</i>, On the
 Distribution of Wealth, 1831, I, 288 ff.; <i>Senior</i>, Outlines, 142
 seq.; <i>Carey</i>, On the Rate of Wages, 1834, 24. Thus, according to
 <i>Ricardo</i>, the increase of one branch is possible only at the expense
 of another, while in the case of flourishing nations, the three branches
 increase absolutely and together. <i>Ricardo</i>, himself, was by no means
 unacquainted with this, as may be seen from <i>Baumstark's</i> German
 translation of his work, pp. 37, 108 ff.</p>

<p class="center smaller">THEORY OF RENT.</p>
<p>Rent is that portion of the regular net product of a piece of land which
remains after deducting the wages of labor and the interest on the capital
usual in the country, incorporated into it.<a id="fnanchor_149-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_149-1">[149-1]</a> Hence it is the price paid for the using of the land
itself, or for what Ricardo calls the original inexhaustible forces <span class="pagenum">[Pg 15]</span> of the soil which are capable of being
appropriated.<a id="fnanchor_149-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_149-2">[149-2]</a> This price also
depends, of course, on the relation between demand and supply; the demand
in turn, on the wants and means of payment of buyers, but the supply by no
means on cost of production, which, from the definitions above given, is
here unthinkable. However, land has this in common with other means of
production, that its price is mainly determined by that of its
products.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_149-1"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_149-1" class="pginternal">[149-1]</a>
 According to <i>von Thünen</i>, Der isolirte Staat. in Beziehung auf
 Landwirthschaft und Nat. Oek, 1850, I, 14: "what remains of the revenue of
 an estate after deducting the interest on all the objects of value which
 may be separated from the soil." According to <i>Whately</i>, it is
 surplus profit. The expression "regular product" supposes, among other
 things, an average skillfulness of the economic individual. Thus, for
 instance, the farm-rent of a piece of land generally includes besides the
 real rent of the land, interest on much capital which is more or less
 firmly fixed in the soil. The importance of the latter may be
 approximately determined from the fact that in the electorate of Hesse,
 for instance, the value of all meadow lands, woods, and agricultural lands
 is estimated at from 205 to 206 millions of thalers, and the value of all
 the houses at 100 millions. (<i>Hildebrand</i>, Statist. Mittheil. über
 die volkswirthschaftlichen Zustände Kurhessens, 1852, 37.) In the English
 income tax of 1843, the annual value of all lands in Great Britain was
 estimated at over 45 millions sterling, that of all houses at over 38
 millions. However the farm-rent of a piece of land does not by any means
 always embrace the entire rent. A part of the rent is paid to the state in
 the form of taxes, and another portion to the payment of tithes. Short
 leasehold terms, frequent land sales, the comparatively great difficulty
 of disengaging capital invested in the cultivation of land, the union of
 landed proprietor, capitalist and laborer in one person easily obscure the
 law of rent.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_149-2"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_149-2" class="pginternal">[149-2]</a>
 The stores of immediate plant food in a piece of land, of minerals in a
 mine, of salt in a salt mine, etc., are subject to the law of rent only in
 so far as they may be considered inexhaustible; that is, they are not,
 strictly speaking, subject to it. Our definition applies all the more to
 the capacity for cultivation, and of support or bearing capacity mentioned
 in § 35; and hence it is easier to follow the law of rent in the case of
 land used for building purposes than for agriculture. When <i>v.
 Mangoldt</i> claims that the exhaustibility or inexhaustibility of the
 soil has nothing to do with rent so long as it flows evenly (<i>so lange
 sie eben fliesst</i>) he is in harmony with his own general conception of
 rarity-premiums (<i>Seltenheitsprämien</i>).</p>
<p class="p2 center"><a id="S150"></a>SECTION CL.</p>
<p class="center smaller">THEORY OF RENT.<br>
(CONTINUED.)</p>
<p>Agricultural products of equal quantity and quality are produced on
pieces of land of unequal fertility, even when the same amount of skill is
displayed by the husbandman, with very different outlays of capital and
labor.<a id="fnanchor_150-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_150-1">[150-1]</a> And yet the price <span class="pagenum">[Pg 16]</span> of these products in the same market is
uniformly the same. This price must, on the supposition of free and
intelligent competition, be, in the long run, at least high enough to cover
the cost of production on even the worst soil (the margin of cultivation
according to Fawcett), which must be brought under cultivation in order to
satisfy the aggregate want. (See § 110.) This worst land need yield no
rent.<a id="fnanchor_150-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_150-2">[150-2]</a> The better land which, with
an equal outlay of labor and capital, produces a greater yield, furnishes
an excess over the cost of production.<a id="fnanchor_150-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_150-3">[150-3]</a> This excess is rent, which, as a rule, is obviously
higher in proportion as the difference in fertility between the worst and
the better land is greater. The person who cultivates the land of a
stranger may unhesitatingly turn this rent over to the owner; since,
notwithstanding his so doing, all that he has himself <span class="pagenum">[Pg 17]</span> contributed to production in labor and
capital of his own, returns to him entire in the product.<a id="fnanchor_150-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_150-4">[150-4]</a></p>
<p>According to § 34, a continual increase in the amount of labor and
capital lavished on the fertilization of land, agricultural science
remaining the same, leads, sooner or later to this, that every new addition
of capital or labor becomes relatively less remunerative than the
preceding.<a id="fnanchor_150-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_150-5">[150-5]</a> The worse the land is,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 18]</span> the sooner is this point reached.
Hence, it necessarily happens that, with an increase in the aggregate want
of agricultural products, greater and greater amounts of labor and capital
are employed in the further fertilization of land, and that there comes to
be a greater difference between the fertility of the worst and better
lands, in consequence of which the rent of the latter rises.<a id="fnanchor_150-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_150-6">[150-6]</a></p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_150-1"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_150-1" class="pginternal">[150-1]</a>
<i>Flotow</i>, Anleitung zur Abschätzung der Grundstücke nach Klassen,
 1820, 50 ff., estimates the cost of production of a <i>scheffel</i> of rye
 on land of the first class, at scarcely 1½ thalers; on land of the tenth
 class, at 3 thalers. In Hanover, it is estimated that about 60 per cent.
 of the land devoted to gardening and agricultural products produces only
 from 2 to 4 times the quantity of seed sown; over 35 per cent. from 5 to 8
 times, and 4.5 per cent. from 9 to 12 times. (<i>Marcard</i>, Zur
 Beurtheilung des Nat. Wohlstandes im Königreich Hanover, Tab. 3.) In
 Prussia, the rates of net produce adopted by the central commission in
 1862 vary from 3 to 420 silver groschens per <i>morgen</i>, in the case of
 agricultural land; from 6 to 420 in the case of meadow land; in the case
 of pasturage, from 1 to 360. (<i>v. Viebahn</i>, Statist. des Zollvereins,
 II, 966.) In England, parliamentary investigations (1821) have shown that
 the best land produces from 32 to 40, and the worst from 8 to 12 bushels
 per acre of wheat. (Edinburgh Review, XL, 21.) As to the influence of the
 elevation of land, the royal Saxon commission for the assessment of the
 value of land, estimated that the net product of an acre <i>of</i> land at

 The English are very fond of assuming that the worst land for the time
 being under cultivation pays no rent. (<i>Ricardo</i>, Principles, II, 2.)
 This fact is frequently obscured by the aggregation into one economic
 whole of land that pays no rent and land that is able to pay rent.
 (<i>John Stuart Mill</i>, Principles, II, ch. 16, § 3.) True it is that
 there is a great deal of land which cannot be farmed out, but which can be
 used only by its owners. Compare <i>Salfeld</i>, in the Landwirthsch.
 Centralb., 1871, II, 182 ff. On land near Wetzlar which, notwithstanding
 the high price of land in the neighborhood, could not be farmed out at
 auction, because no one was desirous to lease it, and which was therefore
 turned over to the highest bidder for the preceding piece, see
 <i>Stöckhardt</i>, Zeitschr. für deutsche Landwirthe, 1861, 237. Where,
 however, all the land has its own proprietors, the competition of farmers
 may easily produce a rent for the worst land. It is a matter of complete
 indifference to the theory of rent, whether the worst land when possessed
 only by right of occupation or used as pasturage for cattle previous to
 its cultivation, had value or not. Compare <i>Nebenius</i>, Oeff. Credit,
 I, 29; <i>Hermann</i>, Staatswirthsch. Unters., 170 seq.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_150-3"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_150-3" class="pginternal">[150-3]</a>
 The analogous gradation in mining may make this clearer.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_150-4"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_150-4" class="pginternal">[150-4]</a>
<i>Ricardo</i> illustrated this by the following example. An uncultivated
 tract of country is settled by a small colony. As long as there is here an
 excess of land of the best quality, and everyone may take possession of it
 without paying anything therefor, no rent of the land which is merely
 occupied is possible. But if all the first class land is under
 cultivation—land which perhaps with the employment of a small amount
 of capital yields 5 quarters an acre per annum; and the increasing
 population necessitates the cultivation of land of the second class, which
 with the same outlay of capital yields only 4 quarters an acre per annum,
 there arises a rent of 1 quarter an acre per annum for land of the first
 class. For the price, 4 quarters is now high enough to cover the cost of
 production per acre, and it must be a matter of complete indifference
 (complete indifference?) to a new comer whether he obtains 5 quarters from
 land of the first class as a farmer and pays out 1 quarter, or whether he
 harvests 4 quarters from second class land as proprietor. If there is a
 further increase of population, so that land of the third class also,
 which yields only 3 quarters per acre per annum, must be brought under
 cultivation, the price of corn rises again because the cost of production
 has now to be covered by three quarters. Land of the first class now pays
 a rent of 2 quarters and second class land of 1 quarter. (Ch. 2.)</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_150-5"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_150-5" class="pginternal">[150-5]</a>
<i>von Thünen</i>, der isolirte Staat, II, I, 179, estimates that a bed of
 manure 1/3 of an inch thick on an acre of ground, increases the production
 by ½; that a second ½ inch of manure increases the yield only by a + of
 5/8 corn; the third of ¼ corn, etc. <i>Geyer</i> is of opinion that, in
 Saxony, land of the average quality will yield a gross product of 60
 thalers per acre, and 14 thalers net product per acre, in case it is
 managed with the greatest intelligence and the employment of a large
 amount of capital; when managed in a very ordinary way, it would yield 20
 thalers gross, and 7½ thalers net product. <i>Thünen</i> gives the
 following formula determining when it is more advantageous to cultivate
 the old land with more <i>intensiveness</i> (higher farming) than to begin
 the cultivation of new: As long as p - <i>a</i>q is less than √<span class="o">ap</span>, so long is an increase of the outlay of capital on
 the same land more profitable than the cultivation of new land, and
 <i>vice versa</i>. Here p = aggregate product obtained by a workman in a
 year from the amount of capital used by him; a = sum of his necessary
 yearly wants; <i>a</i> = the interest per annum of a capital = p; q = the
 amount of capital given to assist the individual workman.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_150-6"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_150-6" class="pginternal">[150-6]</a>
<i>Ricardo</i> had, in every case in which outlay of capital and labor of
 different degrees of productiveness had to be used on the same land, to
 suppose a price of the products = the cost of the least productive outlay.
 See the tables in <i>Ricardo's</i> work, On the Influence of a low Price
 of Corn on the Profits of Stock, 1815, 14 seq. <i>Schmoller</i>, on the
 other hand, rightly applies the principle of united costs of production in
 as far as the usual amount of profit of the producer is added to the cost
 of the commodity with the highest cost of production. Mittheilungen des
 Landwirthsch. Instituts zu Halle, 1865, 128. Compare <i>supra</i>, §§ 106,

<i>L'éloignement équivaut à la stérilité.</i> (<i>J. B. Say.</i>) If we
 imagine with <i>A. Walker</i> an entirely uncultivated country, equally
 fertile in every part, settled only on the coast, and divided into shares
 of equal breadth, equally accessible at all points, so that every settler
 has unlimited space to extend his possessions from the coast into the
 interior, the shares situated in the middle of the coast strip would be
 most eagerly sought after; since in its vicinity, prospectively, all the
 institutions of the country would come together. The colonist, therefore,
 who should obtain that share as his, would, unquestionably, be in a
 condition to pay a price for this preference, that is a rent. (Science of
 Wealth, 296.)</p>

 most accurately in East Friesland, and in similar places: marsh land,

<p class="center smaller">THE THEORY OF RENT.<br>
(CONTINUED.)</p>
<p>From what we have said, it follows that the rent of the land of a
country is equal at least to the sum of all the differences between the
product of the least productive portions of capital which have been
necessarily laid out in the cultivation of the soil and the product of the
other portions more productively laid out by other husbandmen. It may rise
higher than this on account of a coalition among landowners or immoderate
competition among farmers, who may thereby be forced to surrender a portion
of their wages and interest on capital to the former; but it can never
lastingly fall below this amount. If the landowners themselves were to
surrender all claim to rent, the price of agricultural products would not
sink if the market was kept fully supplied; and the excess obtained from
the better land over and above the cost of production would go, but only in
the nature of a gift, to the farmers, corn dealers and individual
consumers.<a id="fnanchor_152-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_152-1">[152-1]</a> Normal rent is not to

greater difficulties to every successive and additional improvement.<a id="fnanchor_152-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_152-3">[152-3]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 21]</span>Moreover, the capital which becomes
a part of the land to such an extent that it cannot be separated from it,
and perhaps not even distinguished from it at sight, such for instance as
has been laid out for purposes of drainage or in the purchase of material
intended to modify the nature of the soil, partakes of the character of the
land itself, and its yield obeys the laws of rent. How frequently it
happens that such improvements made by the farmer without the least
assistance from the owner of the land permanently contribute to an increase
of the rent. (§ 181.)<a id="fnanchor_152-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_152-4">[152-4]</a></p>

 arises exclusively from the monopoly of the owners, and that without it
 the price of corn would be lower. It is certain, however, that if the land
 of a country be considered as one great piece of property, and under one
 great system of husbandry, the products of the soil might be offered
 permanently at a price corresponding to the average cost of production, on
 the better and worse pieces of land. (<i>Umpfenback</i>, N. Oek., 191.)</p>

<i>Ricardo</i> says that if air, water, elasticity and steam were of
 different qualities, and might be made objects of exclusive possession;
 and that if each kind could be had only in a moderate supply, they would,
 like land, produce a rent, according as they were brought into use, one
 kind after another. In the class of natural forces, also, the possession
 of a secret of production or of inimitable skill, or a legal right to its
 exclusive use, may produce something similar to rent. (<i>Senior</i>,
 Outlines, 91.) <i>Hermann</i>, Staatswirthsch. Unters., 163 ff., had
 already laid the foundation of this doctrine, and earlier yet,
 <i>Canard,</i> 17 seq., and <i>Hufeland</i>. I, 303 ff. See <i>supra</i>,
 § 120. Hence <i>v. Mangoldt</i> uses the word rent to designate all
 rarity-premiums. <i>John Stuart Mill</i>, III, ch. 5, 4. <i>Schäffle</i>
 speaks of the universal existence of a surplus; that is, of the factor of
 rent (Nat. Oek., I, Aufl., 140 ff.), and has recently developed this into a
 theory thoroughly systematic and detailed. (Nationalökonomische Theorie
 der ausschliessenden Absatzverhältnisse, 1867.)</p>
<p class="footnote">According to him, rent is "the premium paid for the
 most economic course taken in the interest of society in general;" and
 hence he finds rent as much in superior labor and in a very advantageous
 outlay of capital. Yet he grants, that "exclusive custom (<i>Kundschaft</i>)
 on the basis of natural advantages occurs only in the case of land-rent."
 (59.) And even granting that he is right, that no rent is by itself
 forever secure (74 seq.), and that much rent is a premium paid for a
 search after and the appropriation of the best land, divination of the
 best situations, etc. (60 ff., 74 ff.), there still remains the great
 difference between rent and the extra income from labor and capital; that
 here the very transitory nature of the substratum, or basis, and the
 personal merit of the recipient, is the rule, while in the former case it
 is a rare exception. Willingly, therefore, as I recognize the possibility
 and fruitfulness of Schäffle's way of conceiving this subject (the latter,
 especially, for monographic purposes), I prefer, so far as the entire
 system is concerned, the keeping apart of the three branches of income
 corresponding to the three factors of production as has been usual since
 Adam Smith's time.</p>

<i>John Stuart Mill</i>, ch. 16, § 5. An example in <i>Fawcett</i>,
 Manual, 149 seq. This explains many objections to Ricardo's laws, which
 are the result of misconception. Thus, for instance, in <i>Schmalz</i>,
 Staatswirthschaftslehre, I, 81, Quarterly Review, XXXVI, 412 ff.
 <i>Bastiat</i>, Harmonies économiques, ch. 9, where rent is considered the
 interest on the capital laid out in bringing land under cultivation and
 improving it. If, however, we imagine an island to emerge suddenly from
 the waves in the vicinity of Naples, in consequence of an earthquake, no
 one can doubt that its land would sell at a very high rate and pay a very
 good rent. And yet no capital or labor has been laid out on it. A similar
 lesson is taught by the fact, that, in Scotland, rocks which are covered
 twice a day by the waves are leased for the sake of the sea-weed left on
 them. (<i>Adam Smith</i>, Wealth of Nations, I, ch. 11.) Also by the fact,
 that in Poulopinang, a cavity in which many edible swallows' nests are
 found, pays £500 a year rent. (Geogr. Ephemeriden, Oct., 1805, 134.)
 However, <i>Bastiat</i>, abstractly speaking, is right when he says, that
 every one by the importation of agricultural products from quarters which
 pay no rent, and still more by emigrating thither, may deprive the owners
 of land of the tribute imminent in rent.</p>
<p class="footnote">But how would it be if the cost of transportation and
 emigration amounted to more than the rent? The case theoretically so
 important, in which all the land in the world is supposed to have been
 appropriated as private property, this writer, generally so lucid, treats
 in a surprisingly blind way (275 ff). It is remarkable that <i>A.
 Walker</i>, Science of Wealth, spite of his prejudices in favor of
 Bastiat's doctrines on the gratuitous nature of all natural forces,
 nevertheless follows, essentially, <i>Ricardo's</i> theory of rent, 294

<p class="center smaller">THEORY OF RENT.<br>
(CONTINUED.)</p>
<p>Ricardo says that rent can never, not even in the slightest degree,
constitute an element in the price of corn. This is certainly not a very
happy way of expressing the truth, that a high rent is not the cause, but
the effect, of a relatively high price of corn.<a id="fnanchor_153-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_153-1">[153-1]</a> Ricardo would have been nearer right had he said
that rent was not a component part of the price of every portion of the
supply of corn brought to market.</p>
<p>Is rent an addition to national income? Ricardo (ch. 31) answers this
question in the negative, and says that it takes from the consumers what it
gives to the owners of the land, and that it increases only the value in
exchange of the national wealth.<a id="fnanchor_153-2">
</a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_153-2">[153-2]</a> It is evident
that as thus stated, the question is not properly put. Neither interest on
capital nor wages are any <span class="pagenum">[Pg 23]</span> addition to
a nation's income, but, like rent, only forms of trade, by means of which
that income is distributed among the individuals constituting the nation.
(§ 201.)</p>
<p>The special kind of product obtained from a piece of land influences its
rent only in so far as the growth of that kind of product is exclusively
confined either by nature, privilege or prejudice to certain land.<a id="fnanchor_153-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_153-3">[153-3]</a> Adam Smith is of opinion that the rent of
agricultural land is ordinarily (!) one-third of the gross product; that of
coal mines, from one tenth to a maximum of one-fifth; of good lead and tin
mines, one sixth (with the dues paid the state of twenty-one and two-thirds
per cent.); of Peruvian silver mines, scarcely one-tenth; of gold mines,
one-twentieth. And he thinks that rent grows less certain for every
succeeding article.<a id="fnanchor_153-4"></a> <a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_153-4">[153-4]</a></p>
<p>So far as this is based on facts, it may be explained as follows: The
greater capacity an article has for transportation from one place to
another, the less important is advantage of situation, which is generally
one of the chief elements of rent. The more indispensable the commodity is,
the more readily is the consumer induced to pay a price for it greater than
the cost of production; that is, to pay a rent. This again is enhanced by
the difficulty of the preservation of the commodity. Lastly, the more it is
a mere product of nature,<a id="fnanchor_153-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_153-5">[153-5]</a>
the more difficult it is to simultaneously employ several portions of
capital of different grades of productiveness in its production.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_153-1"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_153-1" class="pginternal">[153-1]</a>
 To be met with in this form even in <i>Adam Smith</i>, Wealth of Nations,
 I, ch. 11, pr. <i>John Stuart Mill</i>, Principles II, ch. 16, § 6, thus
 states the matter: "Whoever cultivates land, paying a rent for it, gets in
 return for his rent an instrument of superior power to other instruments
 of the same kind for which no rent is paid. The superiority of the
 instrument is in exact proportion to the rent paid for it." According to
 <i>v. Jacob</i>, Grundsätze der Nat. Oek., I, 187, rent constitutes a much
 larger portion of the price of commodities than is generally supposed, in
 as much as wages depend so largely on the price of the means of
 subsistence. Per contra, <i>Baudrillart</i>, Manuel, 391 ff., who
 maintains that rent is practically insignificant.</p>

 Nature and Progress of Rent, 15. I would call attention <i>en passant</i>
 to the absurdity that there may be an increase in the value in exchange of
 a nation's entire resources without any increase in its value in use.

 Thus <i>Adam Smith</i> remarks that corn fields and rice fields pay very
 different rents, because it is not always possible to convert one into the
 other. (Wealth of Nat., I, ch. 11, 1.) Compare the tabular statistical
 view of the rent of land used for vineyards, gardens, meadows, pasturages,
 wood and farming purposes, in <i>Rau</i>, Lehrbuch, I, § 218. For a

(CONTINUED.)</p>
<p>As the purchase of a piece of land<a id="fnanchor_154-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_154-1">[154-1]</a>
is no more and no less than its exchange against a portion of capital in
the shape of money,<a id="fnanchor_154-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_154-2">[154-2]</a> its purchase price
depends generally on the amount it will rent for as compared with the
interest on the capital to be given in exchange for it. The rate of
interest remaining the same, it rises and falls with its rent. And <i>vice
versa</i>, the rent remaining the same it rises and falls inversely as the
rate of interest.<a id="fnanchor_154-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_154-3">[154-3]</a> A rise in the price of
land is not always a proof of the growing wealth of a people. It may
proceed from a depreciation of the value of money, or from a decrease of
the rate of interest caused by a decline in the number of loans which can
be advantageously placed.</p>
<p>It is frequently said, that the price paid for land is greater than the
money-capital which yields an equal revenue.<a id="fnanchor_154-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_154-4">[154-4]</a>
This, abstraction made of proletarian distress prices for small parcels of
land and of the political and social privileges of landowners, is accounted
for by the assumed greater security of the latter,<a id="fnanchor_154-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_154-5">[154-5]</a>
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 25]</span> which, however, fares ill enough in
war times, and times of political disturbance. The fact itself is found to
exist, I think, only in economically progressive times, when confidence
prevails, and it is based on the pretty certain prospect that the rate of
interest will decline, while rents will rise.<a id="fnanchor_154-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_154-6">[154-6]</a></p>
<p>It has been observed in Belgium, that the medium farm rent of land, in
quarters remarkable for any economic peculiarity whatever, pays an interest
lower, as compared with the purchase money, in proportion as the country
about is more thickly populated, and as its husbandry is carried on by
farmers instead of by owners.<a id="fnanchor_154-7"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_154-7">[154-7]</a> This phenomenon is doubtless correlated with these
others, that the conditions just named are pretty regularly attendant on a
high state of civilization, and that advanced civilization is attended
uniformly by a decline in the rate of interest. (175).<a id="fnanchor_154-8"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_154-8">[154-8]</a></p>

 In every day language, people say of a man who has purchased a piece of

 There are traces to be found of the fact among the ancient Greeks, that
 the farm-rent of landed estates paid a smaller interest on the purchase
 money than was otherwise usual in the country. <i>Isaeus de Hagn.</i>, 42;

 Compare <i>List</i>, Werke II, 173. In Belgium, farm-rent per
 <i>hectare</i> was, in 1830 = 57.25 francs, in 1835 = 62.78, in 1840 =
 70.44, in 1846 = 74.50, on an average. This was at the rate of from 2.62
 to 2.80, or an average of 2.67 per cent. on the purchase money. If to this
 we add the increase in the rise of land between 1830 and 1846, divided by
 16, the yearly revenue rises from 2.67 to 3.91 per cent., that is pretty
 nearly the rate of interest on hypothecation, and is higher or lower in
 the different provinces, as the former is higher or lower. (<i>Heuschling</i>,
 Résumé du Récensement général de 1846, 89.) In France, land paid but from
 2 to 3 per cent. on the purchase money; but both rents and the price of
 land have doubled between 1794 and 1844. (Journal des Econ., IX, 208.)</p>

 Moreover, whole countries may, because of their great natural advantages,
 possess, so far as the commerce of the entire world is concerned,
 something analogous<a id="fnanchor_TN4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN4">[TN 4]</a> to rent. Thus, for instance,
 North America, although here, this world-rent finds expression in the
 national height of the wages of labor and of the rate of interest, (<i>v.

 Writers as old as <i>Culpeper</i>, A Tract against the high Rate of
 Usurie, 1623, and <i>Sir J. Child</i>, Discourse of Trade, p. 22 of the
 French translation, observed the connection existing between a low rate of
 interest, national wealth and a flourishing state of commerce on the one
 hand, and a high price of the necessaries of life and of land in the
 other. <i>Sir W. Petty</i> would estimate the rent of land as follows: If
 a calf pasturing in an open meadow gains as much flesh in a given time as
 is equal to the cost of the food of 50 men for a day, and a workman, on
 the same land, in the same time, produces food for 60 men, the rent of the
 land must be 50, and the rate of wages 10. (Political Anatomy of Ireland,
 62 seq.; compare 54.) Besides, he accounts for the height of rents by the
 density of the population exclusively, and he would prefer to see both
 increase <i>ad infinitum</i>. (Several Essays on Political Arithmetic, 147
 ff.)</p>
<p class="footnote">The germs of the <i>Ricardo</i> law of rent, in
 <i>Boisguillebert</i>: the price of corn determines how far the
 cultivation may be extended; by manuring the land, as much corn as desired
 may be obtained, provided the cost of production is covered. (Traité des
 Grains, II, ch. 2 ff.) There is a foreshowing of the same law in the
 Physiocratic view that only in the production of raw material is there a
 real excess over and above the cost—<i>produit net</i>. Compare
 <i>Quesnay</i>, Probl., économique, 177 ff. Sur les travaux des artisans.
 (Daire.) <i>Auxiron</i>, Principes de tout Gouvernement, 1776, I, 126.
 <i>Adam Smith</i> came very near to the true principle in the case of coal
 mines, but was hindered reaching it in other cases by the false assumption
 that certain kinds of agricultural production always yield a rent, while
 others do so only under certain circumstances. Besides he always
 considered the interest of capital fixed in the soil; buildings, for
 instance, as part of the rent. (Wealth of Nat., I, ch. 11.) Compare
 <i>Hume's</i> Letter to Adam Smith; <i>Burton's</i> Life and
 Correspondence of Hume, II, 486; <i>von Thünen</i>, Isolirter Staat., I,
 15 ff.</p>
<p class="footnote">The most immediate predecessors of <i>Ricardo</i>,
 Principles, 2, 3, 24, 31, are <i>Anderson</i> (§ 152); <i>West</i>, Essay
 on the Application of Capital to Land, 1815, and <i>Malthus</i>, Inquiry
 into the Nature and Progress of Rent, 1815. See § 152. It is wonderful how
 a theory which, in 1777, remained almost untouched, was in 1815 etc.,
 attacked and defended with the greatest zeal, because it then affected the
 differences between the moneyed and landed interest. Yet <i>Ricardo</i>
 did not take into account at all the rent-creating influence of the
 situation of land in relation to the market, as well as to the
 "farm-office" (<i>dem Wirthschaftshofe</i>). The influence of the system
 of husbandry on rent, first thoroughly treated by <i>von Thünen</i>, loc.
 cit. What has recently been urged against <i>Ricardo</i> by, for instance,
 <i>J. B. Say</i>, Traité, II, ch. 9; <i>Sismondi</i>, N. P., III, ch. 12;
 <i>Jones</i>, Essay on the Distribution of Wealth, 1831 (see Edinburg
 Review, LIV), bears evidence either of a misunderstanding of the great
 thinker, or else contains only modifications of some individual abstract
 propositions of his, stated perhaps too strictly. In judging
 <i>Ricardo</i>, it must not be forgotten, that it was not his intention to
 write a text-book on the science of Political Economy, but only to
 communicate to those versed in it the result of his researches, in as
 brief a manner as possible. Hence he writes so frequently making certain
 assumptions; and his words are to be extended to other cases only after
 due consideration, or rather re-written to suit the changed case.</p>
<p class="footnote"><i>Baumstark</i> very correctly says: "Rent rises, not
 because new capital has been invested, but when the circumstances of trade
 make a new addition to capital possible." (Volkswirthschaftliche
 Erläuterungen über Ricardo's System, 1838, 567.) <i>Fuoco's</i> Nuova
 Teoria della Rendita, Saggi economici, No. 1, is nothing but an Italian
 version of the doctrines of Malthus and Ricardo. The greater number of
 anti-Ricardo theories of rent have originated from the rapid and
 apparently unlimited growth of national husbandry in recent times. Thus it
 is a fundamental thought in <i>Rodbertus</i>, Sociale Briefe, 1851, No. 3,
 that an increase of the price of corn need not attend an increase of
 population, either uniformly or necessarily. According to <i>Carey</i>,
 The Past, the Present and the Future, ch. 1, 1848, the most fertile land
 is last brought under cultivation, because it is covered with swamps,
 forests, etc.; and because it offers greater resistance to the work of the
 agriculturist, by reason of its luxurious vegetation. The more elevated
 lands are first cultivated which present fewer obstacles to cultivation on
 account of their dryness, their thinner crust, etc. Carey generalizes this
 and thinks he has reversed the <i>Ricardo</i> law of rent! He overlooks
 entirely that <i>Ricardo</i> speaks only of the original powers of the
 soil. Now a swampy land which must be dried at the expense of a great deal
 of labor, possesses less of these original powers than a sandy soil which
 may be sown immediately. See <i>Carey</i>, Essay on the Rate of Wages, 232
 ff., and the lengthy exposition of the same doctrine rank with inexact
 natural science and unhistorical history in the same author's Principles
 of Social Science, 1858, vol. I.</p>
<p class="footnote">There is this much truth, however, in Carey's error
 that, with increasing economic progress, the superiority not only of
 situation, relatively to the market, but also of natural fertility, may of
 itself go over to other lands. Thus, for instance, the ancient Slaves used
 clay soil everywhere as pasturage, and cultivated the sandy soil, because
 their pick-axes could overcome the resistance only of the latter.
 <i>Langethal</i>, Geschicte der deutschen Landw., II, 66; <i>Waitz</i>,
 Schlesw. Holstein, Gesch., I, 17. Similarly in Australia: <i>Hearne</i>,
 Plutology, 1864. Compare, <i>Roscher</i>, Nationalökonomik des Ackerbaues,

 present agricultural sense. In a lower stage of civilization, the facility
 of military defense or the <i>ut fons, ut nemus
 placuit</i>—<i>Tacit.</i>, Germ., 16—may have more weight.</p>
<p class="footnote">The chief difference in the theories of rent consists
 in this: whether rent is considered a result of production or only of
 distribution, and an equalization of gain. Compare <i>Behrens</i>, Krit.

beginning of the nineteenth century, landed estates were paid for in
proportion to the magnitude of the live stock on them, so that it seemed,
at least, as if the land was given for nothing, or simply thrown in with
the purchase. And only a short time since, an English acre in the same
country, fifteen <i>leguas</i> from the capital, was worth from three to
four pence, and at a distance of fifty <i>leguas</i>, only two pence.<a id="fnanchor_155-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_155-2">[155-2]</a> In Russia, also, not long since, the valuation

suggestive of the previous situation when no rent was paid.<a id="fnanchor_155-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_155-3">[155-3]</a> Where, in relatively uncivilized medieval

<p>Under these circumstances, it is natural that great landowners,
especially in the lower stages of civilization, should exert an especially
great influence; and that their low tenants (<i>Hintersassen</i>) are more
dependent in proportion to the want of capital and the absence of trade.
Hence, these are wont to make up for the smallness of their rent by great
honors paid <span class="pagenum">[Pg 29]</span> to their landlords, and
great services, especially military service.<a id="fnanchor_155-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_155-4">[155-4]</a> Besides, the lords of the manor, in almost every

of interest on capital by prohibiting interest, by usury laws, etc.; and
thus, in both ways, to artificially increase their own share of the
national income.</p>

gradually concentrated in large cities, this fact also must contribute to
raise rents, because it requires a multitude of costly transportations of

 As to the history of rents in England, a comparison of the years from 1480
 to 1484, with the most recent times, shows that the amount of rent
 estimated in money in agricultural districts, where no very great
 "improvements" have been made, have increased as 1 to 80-100, while the
 price of wheat has increased 12-fold and wages 10-fold. (<i>Rogers</i>, in
 the Statist. Journal, 1864, 77.) According to <i>Hume</i>, History of
 England, ch. 33, it seems that rents under Henry VIII. were only 1/10 of
 those usually paid in his time, while the price of commodities was only ¼
 of the modern. <i>Davenant</i>, Works, II, 217, 221, estimates the
 aggregate rent of land, houses and mines, at the beginning of the
 seventeenth century, at £6,000,000; about 1698, at £14,000,000;
 capitalized respectively at £72,000,000 and £252,000,000. About 1714,
 <i>J. Bellers</i>, Proposals for Employing the Poor, puts it at
 £15,000,000; about 1726, <i>Erasm. Phillips</i>, State of the Nation in
 Respect to Commerce etc., at £20,000,000; about 1771, <i>A. Young</i>, at
 £16,000,000; about 1800, <i>Beeke</i>, Observations on the Income-Tax, at
 £20,000,000; about 1804, <i>Wakefield</i>, Essay on Political Economy, at
 £28,000,000; about 1838, <i>McCulloch</i>, Statist., I, 535, at
 £29,500,000. The poor tax in England and Wales, in 1841, was on a
 valuation of £32,655,000. (<i>Porter</i>, Progress, VI, 2, 614); 1864-5,
 the annual value of lands, £46,403,853 (Stat. Journal, 1869.) Moreover,
 the income from houses, railroads, etc. (real property other than lands),
 increased very much more than that received from pieces of farming land;
 between 1845 and 1864-5, the former by 392.8 per cent., and the latter by
 27.9 per cent. (<i>Hildebrand's</i> Jahrbb., 1869, II, 383 seq.); and the
 income tax of 1857 on £47,109,000. There was a still more rapid growth of
 rent in Scotland. In 1770, it was only £1,000,000-1,200,000: in 1795,
 £2,000,000; in 1842, £5,586,000. (<i>McCulloch</i>, I, 576, ff.) In
 Ireland, about 1776, it was only $900,000, according to <i>Petty</i>.
 (Political Anatomy of Ireland, I, 113.) <i>A. Young</i> assumed it to be
 £6,000,000 in 1778; <i>Newenham</i>, View of Ireland, about 1808,
 £15,000,000. In many parts of the Rosendale Forest in Lancashire, the land
 is leased by the ell, at £121, and even at £131 per acre; i. e., more than
 the whole forest of 15,300 acres was rented for in the time of James I. In
 many of the moorland portions of Lancashire, rent has risen in 150 years,
 1,500 and even 3,000 per cent. (Edinburg Rev., 1843, Febr., 223.)</p>

<p class="center smaller">HISTORY OF RENT.—IMPROVEMENTS IN THE ART OF
AGRICULTURE.</p>
<p>Improvements in the art of agriculture which are confined to individual
husbandmen leave rent unaffected. They do not perceptibly lower the price
of agricultural products, and only effect an increase of the reward of
enterprise which is entirely personal to the more skillful producers and
does not attach to the ground itself.</p>
<p>But how is it when these improvements become general throughout the
country? If population and consumption remain unchanged, the supply of
agricultural products will exceed the demand. This would compel farmers, if
there be no avenue open to exports, to curtail their production. The least
fertile and most disadvantageously situated parcels of land will be
abandoned to a greater or less extent, and the least productive capital
devoted to agriculture, withdrawn. In this way, rent goes down both
relatively and absolutely, although the owners of land may be able to
partially cover their loss by the gain which results to them as consumers
and capitalists.<a id="fnanchor_157-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_157-1">[157-1]</a> (§ 186). After a time,
however, and as a consequence <span class="pagenum">[Pg 33]</span> of the
diminished price of corn, population and consumption will increase, and
entail an extension of agriculture and a consequent rise in rents.<a id="fnanchor_157-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_157-2">[157-2]</a> If it, relatively speaking, reaches the same
point as before, it still is absolutely much greater than before. Let us
suppose that there are three classes <span class="pagenum">[Pg 34]</span>
of land of equal extent in a country, which for an equal outlay of capital
produce 100,000, 80,000 and 70,000 bushels yearly. The rent of the land
here would be equal to at least 40,000 bushels. If the yield of production
now doubles, while the demand for agricultural products also doubles, the
aggregate harvest will be 200,000 + 160,000 + 140,000 bushels, and
consequently rent will have risen to at least 80,000 bushels. But this
increase of rent has injured no one. If the population increases in a less
degree than the productiveness of the land, the consumer may, to a certain
extent, gain largely, and the landowner better his condition. However,
great agricultural improvements spread so gradually over a country, that,
as a rule, the demand for agricultural products can keep pace with the
increased supply. But even in this case, that transitory absolute decline
of rent may be avoided; and it cannot be claimed universally, as it is by
many who are satisfied with mumbling Ricardo's words after him, that an
increase of rent is possible only by an enhancement of the price of the
products of the soil. Where the development of a people's economy is a
normal one, the rent of land is wont to increase gradually, but at the same
time to constitute a diminishing quota of the entire national income.<a id="fnanchor_157-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_157-3">[157-3]</a></p>
<p>Improvements in milling,<a id="fnanchor_157-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_157-4">[157-4]</a> and in the instruments of transportation<a id="fnanchor_157-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_157-5">[157-5]</a> <span class="pagenum">[Pg 35]</span> adapted
to agricultural products, and the introduction of cheaper<a id="fnanchor_157-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_157-6">[157-6]</a> food, have the same effect as improvements of
agricultural production. All such steps in advance render an increase in
population, or in the nation's resources, possible without any
corresponding increase in the amount paid to landowners as tribute money.<a id="fnanchor_157-7"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_157-7">[157-7]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 36]</span>The foregoing facts furnish us the
data necessary to decide what influence permanent soil improvements have on
the rent of land.<a id="fnanchor_157-8"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_157-8">[157-8]</a> The improved
parcels of land now grow more fertile. Their rentability also increases,
while that of the others becomes not only relatively but absolutely less,
if the demand remains unaltered. The whole is as if capital had been
transformed into fertile land, and this added to the improved land.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_157-1"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_157-1" class="pginternal">[157-1]</a>
 Since it has seemed absurd to many writers to say that an improvement in
 the art of agriculture may cause rents to decline (compare <i>Malthus</i>,
 Principles, I, ch. 3, 8), <i>John Stuart Mill</i>, Principles, IV, ch. 3,
 § 4, prefers to put the question thus: whether the landowner is not
 injured by the improvement of the estates of other people, although his
 own is included in the improvement. Compare <i>Davenant</i>, Works, I,
 361. And so the long agricultural crisis through which Germany passed at
 the beginning of the third decade of this century was produced mainly by
 the great impulse given to agriculture (<i>Thaer</i>, <i>Schuerz</i>
 etc.), while population did not keep pace with it. Similarly, at the same
 time, in England, <i>McCulloch</i>, Stat., I, 557 ff. Of course, the less
 fertile pieces of land declined even relatively most in price. From 1654
 to 1663, Switzerland experienced a severe agricultural crisis, attended
 with oppressive cheapness of corn, a great decline in the price of land,
 innumerable cases of insolvency, revolts of the peasantry, emigration,
 etc. (<i>Meyer von Knonau</i>, Handbuch d. schweiz. Gesch., II, 43.) The
 Swiss had, precisely during the Thirty Years' War which spared them, so
 extensively developed their agricultural interests, that now that other
 countries began to compete with them, they could not find a market large
 enough for their products. For English instances of similar "agricultural
 distress" in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, see <i>Child</i>,
 Discourse on Trade, 73, 124 seq.; <i>Temple</i>, Observations upon the U.
 P., ch. 6; <i>Tooke</i>, History of Prices, I, 23 seq., 42. Even where
 there have been no technic improvements, a series of unusually good
 harvests may have the same results, of which there are many instances
 scattered through <i>Tooke's</i> first volume.</p>
<p class="footnote">There is great importance attached in England to the
 difference between those agricultural reforms which save land and those
 which effect a saving in capital and labor. The latter, it is said,
 decrease the money rent of the landowner by depreciating the price of
 corn, but leave the corn-rent unaltered. The former, on the other hand,
 decrease the rent both in money and corn, but the money rent in a higher
 degree. (<i>Ricardo</i>, Principles, ch. 2; <i>J. S. Mill</i>, Principles,
 IV, ch. 3, 4.)</p>

<a href="#fnanchor_157-2" class="pginternal">[157-2]</a>
 When the demand for products of the soil which minister to luxury, such as
 fat meat, milk, vegetables, is increasing, a greater cheapness of the
 necessary wheat may raise rent, for the reason that lands are now
 cultivated which were not formerly tillable. Thus, there is now land in
 Lancashire which could not formerly be planted with corn, because the
 laborers would have consumed more than the harvest yielded. Since the
 large imports of the means of subsistence from Ireland these lands have
 been transformed into artificial meadows, gardens, etc. (<i>Torrens</i>,
 The Budget, 180 ff.) Compare <i>Adam Smith</i>, I, 257, ed. Bas.
 <i>Banfield</i> would misuse these facts to overturn the theory of
 Ricardo. (Organization of Industry, 1848, 49 ff.)</p>

<p class="footnote">so that the preponderance of immoveable property
 constituted a converging series of 78, 43, and 31 per cent.
 (<i>Parieu.</i>) In North America, with its great unoccupied territory,
 the reverse is the case. The census of 1850 gave a moveable property of 36
 per cent.; that of 1860 of only 30 per cent. According to <i>Dubost</i>,
 the rent of land in Algeria was 80 per cent., a gross product of only
 10-15 francs per <i>hectare</i>; in Corsica, 66 per cent., a gross yield
 of from 30-35 per cent.; in the Department du Nord, 17.5-24 per cent., a

 The repeated sifting of the bran (<i>mouture économique</i>) had great
 influence in this respect. In France, in the sixteenth century, a
 <i>setier</i> of wheat gave only 144 pounds of bread. In 1767, according
 to <i>Malouin</i>, L'Art du Bonlanger, it gave 192 pounds. It now gives
 from 223 to 240 pounds. The gain in barley is still greater; the
 <i>setier</i> gives 115 pounds of flour, formerly only 58.

 In the beginning of the eighteenth century, the counties in the
 neighborhood of London addressed a petition to Parliament against the
 extension of the building of turnpike roads which caused their rents to
 decline, from the competition of distant districts. (<i>Adam Smith</i>,
 Wealth of Nat., I, ch. 11, 1.) Compare <i>Sir J. Stewart</i>, Principles,
 I, ch. 10. Improvements in transportation which affect the longest and
 shortest roads to a market in an absolutely equal degree, as, for
 instance, the bridging of a river very near the market, leave rent
 unaffected. (<i>von Mangoldt</i>, V. W. L., 480.)</p>

<i>Malthus</i>, Principles, 231 ff. If the laboring class were to become
 satisfied with living on potatoes instead of meat and bread as hitherto,
 rents would immediately and greatly fall, since the necessities of the
 people might then be obtained from a much smaller superficies. But after a
 time, the consequent increase in population might lead to a much higher
 rent than before; since a great deal of land too unfertile for the
 cultivation of corn might be sown with potatoes, and thus the limits of
 cultivation be reached much later.</p>

<a href="#fnanchor_157-7" class="pginternal">[157-7]</a>
 In France, between 1797 and 1847, the average price of wheat did not rise
 at all. <i>Hipp. Passy</i> mentions pieces of land which produced scarcely
 12 hectolitres of wheat, but which now produce 20—an increased yield
 of 170 francs, attended by an increase in the cost of only 75 francs.
 (Journal des Economistes, 15 Oct., 1848.) Moreover, it may be that a not
 unimportant part of modern rises in the price of corn may be accounted for
 by the better quality of the corn caused by higher farming. (<i>Inama
 Sternbeg</i>, Gesch. der Preise, 10 seq.) Such facts, readily explainable
 by <i>Ricardo's</i> theory, remove the objection of <i>Carey</i>,
 <i>Banfield</i> and others, that the condition of the classes who own no
 land has, since the middle ages, unquestionably improved. Political
 Economy would be simply a theory of human degradation and impoverishment,
 if the law of rent was not counteracted by opposing causes.  (<i>Rœsler</i>,
 Grundsätze, 210.) According to <i>Berens</i>, Krit. Dogmengeschichte, 213,
 the actual highness of rent is to be accounted for by the antagonism
 between the "soil-law (<i>Bodengesetz</i>) of the limited power of
 vegetation," and the "progress of civilization" (but surely only to the
 extent that the latter improves the art of agriculture). Thus, too,

 (<i>Locke.</i>) In England, in 1450, land was bought at "14 years'
 purchase;" i. e., with a capital = 14 times the yearly rent paid, in 1470,
 at only "10 years' purchase." (<i>Eden</i>, State of the Poor, III, App.,
 I, XXXV.) This was, doubtless, a consequence of the civil war raging in
 the meantime. The American war (1775-82) depressed the price of land in
 England to "23¼ years' purchase," whereas it had previously stood at 32.
 (<i>A. Young.</i>) The rent of land, in many places in France, declined
 from 10,000 to 2,000 livres, on account of the many wars during Louis
 XIV.'s reign. (<i>Madame de Sévigné's</i> Lettres, 25 Dec, 1689.) Even in
 1677, it was only one-half of its former amount (<i>King</i>, Life of
 Locke, I, 129.) The whole Bekes county (<i>comitat</i>) in Hungary was
 sold for 150,000 florins under Charles VI.; after the unfortunate war with
 France. (<i>Mailath</i>, Oesterreich, Gesch., IV, 523.) Compare
 <i>Cantillon</i>, Nature du Commerce, 248. In Cologne, a new house was
 sold in the spring of 1848 for 1,000 thalers, the site of which alone had
 cost 3,000 thalers; and there are six building lots which formerly cost
 over 3,000 thalers, now valued at only 100 thalers. (<i>von Reden</i>,
 Statist. Zeitschr., 1848, 366.) On the other hand, Napoleon's war very
 much enhanced English rents (<i>Porter</i>, Progress of the Nation, II, 1,
 150 ff.), because it affected England's national husbandry principally by
 hindering the importation of the means of subsistence. (<i>Passy</i>,
 Journal des Economistes, X, 354.)</p>

 Thus the price of lands, in Mecklenburg, between 1817 and 1827, fell 30 to
 40 per cent. in the least fertile quarters; in the better, from 15 to 20

 The average rent in England was, in 1815, 17s. 3d. In the counties, it was
 highest in Middlesex, 38s. 9d.; in Rutland, 38s. 2d.; Leicester, 27s. 3d.;
 lowest in Westmoreland, 9s. 1d. In Wales, the average was 7s. 10d.;

 Caithness, Cromarthy, Inverness and Rosse, from 1s. 1d. to 1s. 5d.;
 Orkneys, 8½d.; Sutherland, 6d.; Shetlands, 3d. In Ireland, the average was
 12s. 9d.; highest in Dublin, 20s. 1½d.; lowest, Donegal, 6s.
 (<i>McCulloch</i>, Stat., I, 544 ff.; Yearbook of general Information,
 1843, 193.) In France, <i>Chaptal</i>, De l'Industrie Fr., 1819, I, 209

 Department of the Seine, 216; Nord, 69.56; Lower Seine, 67.85; in the
 upper Alps, 6.2; in the lower Alps, 5.99: in the Landes, 6.25. While in
 the Landes, only 20 francs a <i>hectare</i> are frequently paid, the
 purchase price in the neighboring Medoc is sometimes 25,000 francs.
 (Journal des Economistes, Jan. 15, 1851.) In Belgium, the average price of
 agricultural land is 52.46; in East Flanders, 53.19; in Namur, 29.24.

GOOD.</p>
<p>We so frequently hear rent called the result of the monopoly<a id="fnanchor_159-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_159-1">[159-1]</a> of land, and an undeserved tribute paid by the
whole people to landowners, that it is high time we should call attention
to the common advantage it is to all. There is evidently danger that, with
the rapid growth of population, the <span class="pagenum">[Pg 38]</span>
mass of mankind should yield to the temptation of gradually confining
themselves to the satisfaction of coarse, palpable wants; that all refined
leisure, which makes life and the troubles that attend it worth enduring,
and which is the indispensable foundation of all permanent progress and all
higher activity, should be gradually surrendered. (See § 145.) Here rent
constitutes a species of reserve fund, which grows greater in proportion as
these dangers impend by reason of the decline of wages and of the profit of
capital, or interest.<a id="fnanchor_159-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_159-2">[159-2]</a> Besides, precisely in
times when rent is high, the sale and divisibility of landed estates act as
a beneficent reaction against the monopoly of land, which is always akin to
the condition of things created by rent.</p>
<p>But it is of immeasurably greater importance that high rents deter the
people from abusing the soil in an anti-economic way; that they compel men
to settle about the centers of commerce, to improve the means of
transportation, and under certain circumstances to engage in the work of
colonization; while, otherwise, idleness would soon reconcile itself to the
heaping together of large swarms of men.<a id="fnanchor_159-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_159-3">[159-3]</a>
The anticipation of rent may render possible the construction of railroads,

 Well discussed by <i>Schäffle</i>, Theorie, 65, 72, 83. <i>Malthus</i>
 considers the capital and labor expended in agriculture more productive
 than any other, because they produce not only the usual interest and
 wages, but also rent. If, therefore, the manufacturing and commercial
 profit of a country = 12 per cent., and the profit of capital employed in
 agriculture = 10 per cent., a corn law which compelled the capital engaged
 in manufactures and commerce to be devoted to agriculture would be
 productive of advantage to the national husbandry in general, if the
 increase in rent should amount to about 3 per cent. (On the Effects of the
 Corn Laws and of a Rise or Fall in the Price of Corn on the Agriculture
 and the general Wealth of the Country, 1815. The Grounds of an Opinion on

<p class="center smaller">THE PRICE OF COMMON LABOR.</p>
<p>Like the price of every commodity, the immediate wages of common labor
is determined by the relation of the demand and supply of labor. Other
circumstances being the same, every great plague<a id="fnanchor_160-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_160-1">[160-1]</a> or emigration<a id="fnanchor_160-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_160-2">[160-2]</a>
is wont, by decreasing the supply, to increase the wage's of labor; and a
plague, the wages of the lowest kind of labor most.<a id="fnanchor_160-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_160-3">[160-3]</a> And so, the increased <span class="pagenum">[Pg
40]</span> demand, in harvest time, is wont to increase wages; and even day
board during harvest time is wont to be better.<a id="fnanchor_160-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_160-4">[160-4]</a> <a id="fnanchor_160-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_160-5">[160-5]</a> In winter the
diminished demand lowers wages again.<a id="fnanchor_160-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_160-6">[160-6]</a> Among the most effective tricks of socialistic
sophistry is, unfortunately, to caricature the correct principle: "labor is
a commodity," into this other: "the laborer is a commodity."</p>
<p>Moreover, common labor has this peculiarity, that those who have it to
supply are generally much more numerous than those who want it; while the
reverse is the case with most other commodities. Another important
peculiarity of the "commodity" labor, is, that it can seldom be bought,
without at the same time reducing the person of the seller to a species of
dependence. Thus, for instance, the seller cannot <span class="pagenum">[Pg
41]</span> be in a place different from that in which his commodity is.
Hence a change in the person, etc. of the buyer very readily necessitates
in the workman a radical change of life, and that the levelling adjustment
of local excess and want is rendered so difficult in the case of this
commodity.<a id="fnanchor_160-7"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_160-7">[160-7]</a> Hence, it is that, if
in the long run the exchange of labor against wages is to be an equitable
one (§ 110), the master of labor must, so to speak, incorporate part of his
own personality into it, have a heart for faithful workmen and thus attach
them to himself.<a id="fnanchor_160-8"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_160-8">[160-8]</a></p>

 High rate of Italian wages after the plague in 1348, but also many
 complaints of the indolence and dissoluteness of workmen. (<i>M.
 Villani</i>, I, 2 ff., 57 seq. <i>Sismondi</i>, Gesch. der ital.
 Republiken in Mittelalter, VI, 39.) In England, the same plague increased
 the wages of threshers from an average of 1.7 d. in 1348, to 3.3 d. in
 1349. Mowers received, during the 90 years previous, 1/12 of a quarter of
 wheat per acre; in 1371-1390, from 1/7 to 1/6. The price of most of their
 wants was then from 1/8 to 1/12 as high as in <i>A. Young's</i> time, and
 wages ¼ as high. (<i>Rogers</i>, I, 306, 271, 691.) The great earthquake
 in Calabria, in 1783, produced similar effects. (<i>Galanti</i>, N.
 Beschreiburg von Neapel, I, 450.) Compare <i>Jesaias</i>, 13, 12. On the
 other hand, depopulation caused by unfortunate wars is not very favorable
 to the rate of wages; instance, Prussia in 1453 ff., after the Polish
 struggle, and Germany, after the Thirty Years' War.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_160-2"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_160-2" class="pginternal">[160-2]</a>
 How much it contributes to raise wages that workmen can, in a credible
 way, threaten to move to other places, is illustrated by the early high
 wages and personal freedom of sailors. Compare <i>Eden</i>, State of the
 Poor, I, 36. In consequence of the recent great emigration from Ireland,
 the weekly wages of farm hands in that country was 57.4 per cent. higher
 than in 1843-4. In Connaught, where the emigration was largest, it was 87
 per cent. higher. (London Statist. Journ., 1862, 454.)</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_160-3"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_160-3" class="pginternal">[160-3]</a>

<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_160-4"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_160-4" class="pginternal">[160-4]</a>
 And this in proportion as the uncertainty of the weather causes haste. In
 England, the harvest doubles wages. (<i>Eden.</i>) In East Friesland, it
 raises it from 8-10 ggr. to 2 thalers sometimes (<i>Steltzner</i>); in the
 steppes of southern Russia, from 12-15, to frequently 40-50 <i>kopeks</i>.
 This explains why the country people who come into the weekly market are
 anxious, during harvest time, to get rid of their stocks as fast as
 possible. According to the Statist. Journal, 1862, 434, 448, the average
 wages in harvest and other times, amounted to:</p>

<p class="footnote">The reason why the wages of females rises more in
 harvest time than the wages of males may be the same that in many places

here embraces not only the necessary or customary means of subsistence of
the workman himself, but also of his family; that is, of the coming
generation of workmen. The number of the latter depends essentially on the
demand for labor. If this demand be such that it may be satisfied by an
average of six children to a family, the rate of wages must be such as to
support the workman himself and to cover the cost of bringing up six
children.<a id="fnanchor_161-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_161-3">[161-3]</a> Where it is <span class="pagenum">[Pg 42]</span> customary for the wife and child, as well as
for the father, to work for wages, the father does not need to earn the
entire support of the family, and hence individual wages may be smaller.<a id="fnanchor_161-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_161-4">[161-4]</a> But if it were to fall below the cost
mentioned above, it would not be long before increased mortality and
emigration, and a diminution of marriages and births would produce a
diminution of the supply; the result of which would be, if the demand
remained the same, a renewed rise of wages.</p>
<p>Conversely, it would be more difficult for the rate of wages to be
maintained long much above that same cost, in proportion as the
gratification of the sexual appetite was more generally considered the
highest pleasure of sense, and the love of parents <span class="pagenum">[Pg 43]</span> for their children as the most natural human
duty. As Adam Smith says, where there is a great demand for men, there will

<i>Cantillon</i>, Nature du Commerce, etc., 1755, is of opinion that a day
 laborer, to bring up two children until they are grown, needs about as
 much as he does for his own support; and that his wife may, as a rule,
 support herself by her own work. (42 ff.) In Germany, it is estimated
 that, in the case of day laborers, a woman can earn only from 1/3 to ½ of
 what her husband does; mainly because she is so frequently incapacitated
 for work by pregnancy, nursing, etc. (<i>Rau</i>, Lehrbuch, I, § 190.) In
 France, in 1832, a man working in the fields earned, on an average, 1¼
 francs a day, the wife ¾ of a franc (200 days to the year), the three
 children 38/100 francs (250 days to the year), an aggregate of 650 francs
 per annum. (<i>Morogues.</i>) In England, the average amount earned in the
 country was for males, per annum, £27 17s.; (munications<a id="fnanchor_TN6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN6">[TN 6]</a> relative to the Support and Maintenance of the Poor,
 1834, p. LXXXVIII.) The wife of an English field hand, without children,
 earns 1/3 more than one with children. In the case of mothers, a
 difference of fewer or more children is unnoticeable in the effects on
 wages. (London Statist. Journal, 1838, 182.) In the spinning factories in
 Manchester, in 1834, children between 9 and 10 years of age were paid,
 weekly, from 2s. 9d. to 2s. 10d.; between 10 and 12, from 3s. 6d. to 3s.
 7d.; between 12 and 14, from 5s. 8d. to 5s. 9d.; between 14 and 16, from
 7s. 5d. to 7s. 6d. (Report of the Poor Commissioners, 204.) Those
 manufactures which require great physical strength, like carpet and
 sail-cloth weaving, and those carried on in the open air and in all kinds
 of weather, allow of no such family competition and debasement of wages.

 Similarly, <i>J. Möser</i>, Patriot. Phant., I, 40. <i>Adam Smith</i>
 infers from the following symptoms in a country that wages are higher
 there than the indispensable minimum, viz.: if wages in summer are higher
 than in winter, since it is seldom that enough is saved in summer to
 satisfy the more numerous wants of winter; if wages vary less from year to
 year and more from place to place than the means of subsistence, it they
 are high even where the means of subsistence are cheapest. (Wealth of

<p>The idea conveyed by the expression necessaries of life is, within

<p>The standard of decency of the working class also has great influence

 contradistinction to means of nutrition. Recent research has shown that in
 cold weather more urea and also more carbonic acid are given off; hence
 the means of supplying this deficit should be greater in cold weather than
 in warm. This more rapid transformation is wont, when nutrition is
 sufficient, to be accompanied by more energetic activity.

 This is opposed in part by the fact that a hot climate induces indolence,
 and that therefore he needs a greater incentive to overcome his
 disposition to idleness. Thus, in the cooler parts of Mexico, the rate of
 wages was 26 sous a day, in the warmer, 32 sous. (<i>Humboldt</i>, N.

<p class="center smaller">WAGES OF LABOR.—POWER OF THE WORKING
CLASSES OVER THE RATE OF WAGES.</p>
<p>In this way, the working classes hold in their own hands one of the
principal elements which determine the rate of wages; and it is wrong to
speak of an "iron law" which, under <span class="pagenum">[Pg 46]</span>
the control of supply and demand, always reduces the average wages down to
the means of subsistence.<a id="fnanchor_163-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_163-1">[163-1]</a> For the moment, indeed, not only individual workmen,
but the whole working class is master of the supply of its commodity only
to a very small extent; since, as a rule, the care for existence compels it
to carry, and that without interruption, its whole labor-power to market.
But it is true that the future supply depends on its own will; since, with
an increase or decrease in the size of the families of workingmen, that
supply increases or diminishes. If, therefore, by a favorable combination
of circumstances, wages have risen above the height of urgent necessity,
there are two ways open to the working class to take advantage of that
condition of things. The workman either raises his standard of living,
which means not only that his necessary wants are better satisfied, his
decencies increased and refined, but also and chiefly, that the
intellectual want of a good prospect in the future, which so particularly
distinguishes <span class="pagenum">[Pg 47]</span> the honorable artisan
from the proletarian is taken into consideration. And it is just here that
a permanent workingmen's union, which should govern the whole class, might
exert the greatest influence. Their improved economic state can be
maintained only on condition that the laboring class shall create families
no larger than they hope to be able to support consistently with their new
wants.<a id="fnanchor_163-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_163-2">[163-2]</a></p>
<p>Or, the laboring class continues to live on as before, from hand to
mouth, and employ their increased resources to gratify their sexual
appetite earlier and longer than before, thus soon leading to an increase
of population.</p>
<p>The English took the former course in the second quarter of the last
century, when English national economy received a powerful impetus, and the
large demand for labor rapidly enhanced the rate of wages. The Scotch did
in like manner a generation later. The second alternative was taken by the
Irish, when the simultaneous spread of the cultivation of the potato<a id="fnanchor_163-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_163-3">[163-3]</a> and the union with England, at the beginning
of the nineteenth century, gave an extraordinary extension to their
resources of food. While the population of Great Britain, between 1720 and
1821, did little more than double, the population of Ireland increased from
2,000,000 to nearly 7,000,000 between 1731 and 1821. No wonder, therefore,
that the average wages of labor was twenty to twenty-four pence per day in
the former, and in the latter only five pence. (<i>MCCulloch.</i>)<a id="fnanchor_163-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_163-4">[163-4]</a></p>
<p>Naturally enough, this difference of choice by the two peoples <span class="pagenum">[Pg 48]</span> is to be explained by the difference in
their previous circumstances. The Irish people, robbed by violence of their
own higher classes, and, therefore, and on this account precisely, almost
entirely destitute of a middle class, had lost the check on increase they
possessed in the middle ages, without having as yet assimilated to
themselves<a id="fnanchor_TN8"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN8">[TN 8]</a> the checks which come with a
higher stage of culture. Their political, ecclesiastical and social
oppression allowed them no hope of rising by temporary sacrifices and
energetic efforts permanently to a better condition as citizens or
gentlemen. Only the free man cares for the future. Hence, the sexual
thoughtlessness and blind good nature, the original tendencies of the Irish
people, necessarily remained without anything to counterbalance them. It
always supposes a high degree of intelligence and self-restraint among the
lower classes, when an increase in the thing-value, or the real value of
wages, does not produce an increase in the number of workmen, but in their
well-being. The individual is too apt to think that it matters little to
the whole community whether he brings children into the world or not, a
species of egotism which has done most injury to the interests in common of
mankind. As a rule, it requires a great and palpable enhancement of wages
to make workmen, as a class, raise their standard of living.<a id="fnanchor_163-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_163-5">[163-5]</a> <a id="fnanchor_163-6">

 Compare especially <i>Malthus</i>, Principles, ch. 4, sec. 2. How little

 in Ireland to 14¾s. (<i>Levi</i>, Wages and Earnings of the working

<a href="#fnanchor_163-5" class="pginternal">[163-5]</a>
 Thus the unheard of long series of excellent harvests in England, between
 1715 and 1765, contributed very largely to this favorable transformation.
 Day wages expressed in wheat, between 1660 and 1719, amounted on an
 average to only about 2/3 of a peck; between 1720 and 1750, to an entire
 peck. In the fifteenth century, a similar series of good harvests
 contributed very much to the flourishing condition of the "yeomanry."
 Under Henry VII., workmen earned from two to three times as much corn as
 they did a century later. And so in France, the great Revolution at the
 end of the eighteenth century, by setting free a vast quantity of hitherto
 bound-up force, enhanced the productiveness of the entire economy of the
 nation, and made the division of the national income more nearly equal.
 There is an essential connection here between the rapidity of the
 transition and the facts, that the habits of consumption of the working
 class received a powerful impulse, and that population increased much less
 rapidly than the national income. Compare <i>John Stuart Mill</i>,
 Principles, II, ch. 11, 2. In our own days again, English workmen had a
 splendid opportunity to raise their standard of life. Emigration to
 Australia, etc. preponderated over the natural increase of population to
 such an extent that, in 1852, for instance, only 217,000 more human beings
 were born in England and Wales than died, and 368,000 emigrated. At the
 same time, exports increased: in 1849, they were £63,000,000; in 1850
 £71,000,000; about the end of 1853, something like £90,000,000.</p>
<p class="footnote">This golden opportunity was used by the English
 laboring classes to both largely multiply marriages and to enhance the
 rate of wages. The number of marriages contracted in England yearly, from
 1843 to 1847, was 136,200; from 1853 to 1857, 159,000. The number of
 births annually, from 1843 to 1847, was 544,800; from 1853 to 1857,
 640,400. And wages, in a number of industries, rose, between 1839 and
 1859, from about 18 to 24 per cent. (Quarterly Review, July, 1860, 86),
 while the prices of most of the necessaries of life declined. That, in the
 same time, the condition of English laborers was elevated, both
 intellectually and morally, is proved by many facts cited in <i>Jones' and
 Ludlow's</i> work on the social and political condition of the laboring
 classes in England. In Germany, the recent establishment of peace on a
 firm footing and the French war contributions have given the country an
 impulse which might be taken advantage of by the laboring class with the
 happiest results if they would accustom themselves to more worthy wants
 and at the same time preserve their accustomed industry.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><a id="S164"></a>SECTION CLXIV.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 49]</span></p>
<p class="center smaller">WAGES.—COST OF PRODUCTION OF LABOR.</p>
<p>As the cheapening of the means of subsistence, when the circle of wants
of the laboring class has not correspondingly increased, leads to a decline
of wages, so an enhancement of their price must, when wages are already so
low as only to be able to satisfy indispensable wants, produce an increase
in the rate of wages. The transition in the former case is as pleasing as
in the latter it is replete with the saddest crises.<a id="fnanchor_164-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_164-1">[164-1]</a> The <span class="pagenum">[Pg 50]</span> slower the
rise in the price of the means of subsistence is, the more it is to be
feared that the working classes will seek to meet it, not by emigration or
by a diminished number of marriages, but by decreasing the measure of their
wants, the introduction of a poorer quality of food, etc.<a id="fnanchor_164-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_164-2">[164-2]</a></p>
<p>However, all this is true only of permanent changes in the average price
of the means of subsistence, such as are produced, for instance, by the
development of agriculture, by taxation etc. Transitory fluctuations, such
as result, for instance, from a single good or bad harvest, cannot have
this result.<a id="fnanchor_164-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_164-3">[164-3]</a> It is, in poor countries at
least, one of the worst effects of a bad harvest, that it tends to
positively lower the rate of wages. A multitude of persons who would
otherwise be able to purchase much labor are now deterred from doing so, by
the enhancement of the price of food.<a id="fnanchor_164-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_164-4">[164-4]</a>
On the other hand, the supply increases: <span class="pagenum">[Pg
51]</span> many men who before would not work even for money, see
themselves now compelled to do so. Those who have been workmen hitherto are
compelled by want to make still greater exertions.<a id="fnanchor_164-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_164-5">[164-5]

 According to <i>McCulloch</i>, Edition of <i>Adam Smith</i>, 472, the food
 of a day laborer's family constitutes between 40 and 60 per cent. of their
 entire support. In the case of Prussian field hands, it is generally 54
 per cent. greatest in the province of Saxony, viz., 58 per cent. and
 lowest in Posen, 43 per cent. Compare <i>Rau</i>, Lehrbuch, I, § 191. This
 may serve as a point of departure, from which to measure the influence of
 a given enhancement of the price of corn. In opposition to <i>Buchanan</i>
 (Edition of <i>Adam Smith</i>, 1817, 59), who had denied the influence of
 the price of the means of subsistence on the rate of wages, see

 How easily English farmers have accustomed themselves to the consequences
 of momentary calamities, may be seen from <i>John Stuart Mill</i>,
 Principles, II, ch. 11, 5 seq.; <i>Thornton</i>, Population and its
 Remedy, 1846, passim. <i>Malthus</i>, Principles, sec. 8, shows in
 opposition to <i>Ricardo</i>, Principles, ch. 8, that it is not all one to
 the laboring classes whether their wages rise while the price of the means
 of subsistence remains the same, or whether the rate of wages remaining
 nominally the same, the commodities to be purchased decline in price. If
 for instance, potato-food, physiologically considered, was just as good as
 flesh-food and wheat bread, yet an unmarried workman or a father with a
 number of children below the average would be able to save less from the
 former for the reason that it possesses less value in exchange. (Edinburg
 Rev., XII, 341.) Thus, e. g., in Ireland, between <i>A. Young</i> and
 <i>Newenham</i> (1778-1808), the rate of wages increased more than the
 price of potatoes, but all other means of subsistence in a still greater
 ratio. (<i>Newenham</i>, A view of Ireland, 1808.) Compare <i>Malthus</i>,

<p class="center smaller">WAGES.—THE DEMAND FOR LABOR.</p>
<p>The demand for labor, as for every other commodity, depends, on the one
hand, on the value in use of it, and on the other, on the purchaser's
capacity to pay for it (his solvability), These two elements determine the
maximum limit of wages, as <span class="pagenum">[Pg 52]</span> the means
of support considered indispensable by the workmen determine the minimum.
There are circumstances conceivable under which the rise in wages might
entirely eat up rents; but there must always be a portion of the national
income reserved to reward capital (its profit). If wages were to absorb the
latter also, the mere owner of capital would cease to have any interest in
the progress of production. Capital would then be withdrawn from employment
and consumed.<a id="fnanchor_165-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_165-1">[165-1]</a> Obviously, no man engaged in
any enterprise can give more as wages to his workmen than their work is
worth to him.<a id="fnanchor_165-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_165-2">[165-2]</a> Hence the additional
product in any branch of industry, due to the labor of the workman last
employed, has a controlling influence on the rate of the wages which can be
paid to his fellow workmen. If the additional products of the workmen
successively last employed constitute a diverging series,<a id="fnanchor_165-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_165-3">[165-3]</a> the last term in the series is the natural
expression of the unsurpassable maximum of wages; if they constitute a
converging series, men the employer can pay the last workman higher wages
than the additional product due to him; provided, however, that the
reduction which is to be expected in the case of the workmen previously
employed to the same level still leaves him a sufficiently high rate of
profit.<a id="fnanchor_165-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_165-4">[165-4]</a> Hence the growing skill
of a workman, in <span class="pagenum">[Pg 53]</span> and of itself, makes
an increase of his wages possible;<a id="fnanchor_165-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_165-5">[165-5]</a>
while, conversely, if he can be replaced by capital, which always
relatively decreases the value in use of his labor, there is a consequent
pressure on his wages.</p>

 Higher wages promised, for instance, as a reward for saving a human life
 or some other very precious thing in great danger of being destroyed. In
 the case of material production, labor is worth to the party engaged in
 the enterprise, at most, as much as the price of the product after the
 remaining cost of reproducing it is deducted.</p>

 Thus, for instance, in harvesting potatoes, if, after they have been
 ploughed up, only those nearest the surface are collected, a laborer can
 gather over thirty Prussian <i>scheffels</i> in a day. But the fuller and
 completer the gathering of potatoes desired is, the smaller will be the
 product of one workman and of one day's labor. If, therefore, a man wants
 to gather even the last bushel in a potato field of 100 square rods, so
 much labor would be required to accomplish it that the workman would not
 gather enough to feed him during his work, to say nothing of supplying his
 other wants. Supposing that 100 <i>scheffels</i> of potatoes had grown on
 100 square rods, and that of these were harvested<span style="white-space:nowrap;">—</span></p>

 In Manchester, in 1828, the wages paid for spinning one pound of cotton
 yarn, No. 200, was 4s. 1d.; in 1831, only from 2s. 5d. to 2s. 8d. But, in
 the former year, the spinner worked with only 312 spools; in the latter,
 with 648; so that his wages increased in the ratio of 1274 to 1566.

<p class="p2 center"><a id="S166"></a>SECTION CLXVI.</p>
<p class="center smaller">WAGES.—PRICE OF COMMON LABOR.</p>
<p>In the case of a commodity as universally desired as human labor is, the
idea of the purchasers' capacity to pay (solvability) must be nearly
commensurate with the national income, or to speak more correctly, with the
world's income.<a id="fnanchor_166-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_166-1">[166-1]</a> In regard <span class="pagenum">[Pg 54]</span> to the different kinds of labor, and especially to
common labor, it is evident that the different kinds of consumption require
very different quantities of them. Here, therefore, we depend on the
direction which national consumption takes, and this in turn is most
intimately related to the distribution of the national income.<a id="fnanchor_166-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_166-2">[166-2]</a> If all workmen were employed in nothing but
the production of articles consumed by workmen, the rate of wages would be
determined almost exclusively by the ratio between the number of the
working population and the amount of the national income. But, if this were
the case, landowners and capitalists would be obliged to live just as
workmen do, and their highest luxury would have to consist in feeding
idlers. (§ 226). The effect must be much the same, when the wealthy are
exceedingly frugal and employ their savings as rapidly as possible in the
employment of common home labor; while, on the other hand, the exportation
of wheat, wood, and other articles, which the working classes consume, in
exchange for diamonds, lace, champagne, diminishes the efficient demand for
common labor in a country.<a id="fnanchor_166-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_166-3">[166-3]</a>
</p>
<p>The assumption frequently made, that the demand for labor depends on the
size of the national capital, is far from exact.<a id="fnanchor_166-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_166-4">[166-4]</a>
Thus, for instance, every transformation of circulating into fixed capital,
especially when the labor used in effecting this transformation is ended,
diminishes the demand for other labor. That principle is not
unconditionally true, even in the case of circulating capital. Thus, for
instance, the rate of wages is wont to be raised by the transfer of capital
from such <span class="pagenum">[Pg 55]</span> businesses as require little
labor into such as require much.<a id="fnanchor_166-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_166-5">[166-5]</a>
Only that part of circulating capital can have any weight here which is
intended, directly or indirectly, for the purchase of labor and for the
purchase of each kind of labor in particular.<a id="fnanchor_166-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_166-6">[166-6]</a> The capital of the employer is, by no means, the
real source<a id="fnanchor_166-7"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_166-7">[166-7]</a> of the wages of even
the workmen employed by him, <span class="pagenum">[Pg 56]</span> It is
only the immediate reservoir through which wages are paid out, until the
purchasers of the commodities produced by that labor make good the advance,
and thereby encourage the undertaker to purchase additional labor.
Correlated to this is the fact, that other circumstances being the same,
those workmen usually receive the highest wages who have to do most
immediately with the consumer.<a id="fnanchor_166-8"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_166-8">[166-8]</a>

<i>Senior</i> denies this. Let us suppose that agriculture in Ireland
 employs on every 200 acres ten working men's families, one-half of whom
 are used to satisfy the aggregate wants of the working people, and the
 other half in the production of wheat to be exported to England. If now
 the English market requires meat and wool instead of wheat, the Irish
 landowner will, perhaps, find it advantageous, of the ten laboring
 families, to employ one in stock raising, a second in obtaining food, etc.
 to support the laborers, and to discharge all the others. If, then, the
 increased net product is employed in the purchase of other Irish labor,
 all goes on well enough; but if, instead of this, the landowners should
 import articles of English manufacture, the demand for labor in Ireland
 would doubtless decrease, notwithstanding the increase of its income.
 (Outlines, I, 154.) <i>Senior</i> here overlooks two things: first, that
 in the supposed case, if eight-ninths of Irish laborers are thrown out of
 employment, spite of the increased income of the owners of landed estates,
 Ireland's national income is on the whole probably diminished (§ 146), and
 secondly, that, possibly, the demand for labor in England experiences a
 greater increase than the decrease in Ireland; since, with the addition to
 the world-income, there would be an increase in the world-demand for
 labor.</p>

 Thus, <i>Thomas More</i>, Utopia, 96, 197, thinks that if every one was

 to fatigue himself very much; while, as it is now, the few real laborers
 there are wear themselves out in the service of the vanity of the rich,
 are poorly fed and worked exceedingly hard.</p>

 Thus, <i>Adam Smith</i> divides "the funds destined for the payment of
 wages" into two kinds: the excess of employers' income over their own
 maintenance, and the excess of their capital over the demands of their own
 use of it. (Wealth of Nat, I, ch. 8.) <i>Senior</i> considers it a
 self-evident principle, that the rate of wages depends on the size of the
 "fund for the maintenance of laborers compared with the number of laborers
 to be maintained." (Three Lectures on the Rate of Wages, 1830, Outlines,
 153, ff.) But what determines the quota of the aggregate national wealth
 and national income that is to constitute this fund? <i>Carey</i>, Rate of
 Wages, 1835, has a very exhaustive commentary on <i>Senior</i>.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_166-7"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_166-7" class="pginternal">[166-7]</a>
<i>Watts</i>, Statist. Journal, 1861, 500, asserts altogether too
 generally that an "increase of profit increases the future wages-fund, and
 consequently the demand for laborers;" and that therefore every new
 machine useful in manufactures must also be of use to the laboring class.
 The employer engaged in any enterprise who has grown richer, <i>can</i>
 pay more wages, but whether he <i>will</i> do it depends on other causes,
 and even his ability to do it, in the long run, on his customers. When
 <i>John Stuart Mill</i>, Principles, I, ch. 5, 9, says that only the
 capital which comes into the hands of labor before the completion of their
 work contributes to their support, it is as if he were to explain the
 phenomena of prices by demand and supply, and nothing else, denying the
 influence of the cost of production, of value in use, and of the deeper
 determining causes upon them. (<i>Supra</i>, § 107, note 1.) Compare
 <i>Roesler</i>, Z. Kritik der Lehre vom Arbeitslohn, 1861, 104 ff. In
 England, the superstition which to a great extent attached to the idea
 "wages-fund," was first questioned by <i>F. Longe</i>, Refutation of the
 Wages-Fund Theory of modern Political Economy, 1866. See also
 <i>Thornton</i>, On Labour, II, ch. 1. Even <i>John Stuart Mill</i>
 dropped his earlier erroneous views on this subject. (Fortnightly Review,
 May and June, 1869.) Not, however, without exaggeration, as is proved by
 his well-known saying, that laborers needed capital but no capitalists.
 Still, even here, he tenaciously holds that a rise in wages which
 increases the price of some classes of commodities, must decrease the
 aggregate demand for commodities. But better paid workmen may now increase
 their demand for commodities to the same extent that the purchasers of
 labor who do not gain as much as before, or the consumers of the goods
 whose price has been enhanced diminish theirs. (<i>Brentano</i>, in
 Hildebrand's Jahrbb., 1871, 374.) Only, this increase need not affect the
 very commodities influenced by the decrease.</p>

 Thus, the person who builds his own house is wont to pay his workmen
 better than a contractor or builder by profession; and the maker of the
 entire manufactured article, as a rule, suffers less frequently than the
 maker of only half of it. (<i>Hermann</i>, Staatsw. Unters., II, Aufl.,

<p class="center smaller">DIFFERENCE OF WAGES IN DIFFERENT BRANCHES OF
LABOR.</p>
<p>All the causes which make wages higher in some branches of labor; than
in others, may be divided into three great categories.<a id="fnanchor_167-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_167-1">[167-1]</a></p>
<p>A. Rare personal acquirements. The supply of labor requiring rare
personal ability will always be limited.<a id="fnanchor_167-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_167-2">[167-2]</a> Such labor must, naturally, have great value in use,
when a small supply of it is met by a great demand.<a id="fnanchor_167-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_167-3">[167-3]</a> It sometimes <span class="pagenum">[Pg 57]</span>
happens that a species of labor can be utilized only by a small circle of
persons who demand it. But the wages for it is raised very high by the
great solvability of those who do demand it. How frequently it happens, for
instance, that a minister is paid a very high salary for the ability he
possesses of making complicated and dry affairs of state attractive to the
personal taste of his sovereign.<a id="fnanchor_167-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_167-4">[167-4]</a>
Here, particularly, the confidence which the workman inspires by his skill
and fidelity enters as an element. Without this confidence, there are many
kinds of business which would be crushed out entirely by the control it
would be necessary to subject them to, and others would not be possible at
all.<a id="fnanchor_167-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_167-5">[167-5]</a> When, for instance, in a
large manufacturing establishment, understrappers, workmen, foremen,
subordinate superintendents, directors, etc., draw different salaries,
their pay, if equitably graduated, should be in harmony with the principles
laid down in § 148, The head of a manufacturing establishment, for
instance, who has organized a more perfect division and coöperation of
labor, himself, and by means of which ten men are enabled to perform <span class="pagenum">[Pg 58]</span> the work before performed by twenty, may
equitably retain, as the reward of his organizing power, a considerable
amount of what was previously paid out in wages. Louis Blanc's proposition,
that all should receive equal salaries is, as Bastiat remarks, equivalent
to the assertion that a yard of cloth manufactured by a lazy or unskillful
workman is worth as much as two yards manufactured by an industrious and
skillful one.<a id="fnanchor_167-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_167-6">[167-6]</a></p>
<p>Such qualified labor, as is treated of here, may be most accurately
estimated, the quality of which supposes a certain cost of acquisition.
This cost may be considered as the outlay of so much capital, which, with
interest,<a id="fnanchor_167-7"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_167-7">[167-7]</a> should come back to the
workman in his wages. Otherwise, others would be deterred from entering the
same business by the example of his loss. Here, especially, it is necessary
to take into account the long period of apprenticeship or tuition, and the
large fees paid for the same; and this, whether they depend on the natural
difficulties in the way of acquirement or on artificial obstacles opposed
to freedom of competition.<a id="fnanchor_167-8"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_167-8">[167-8]</a> The influence of these circumstances is particularly
great in <span class="pagenum">[Pg 59]</span> those kinds of labor which
require a "liberal" education.<a id="fnanchor_167-9"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_167-9">[167-9]</a> Among the costs of production proper, peculiar to
this labor-force, must be included, also, the necessary support of the
workman, during the interval between the completion of his studies and the
beginning of his full reward.<a id="fnanchor_167-10"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_167-10">[167-10]</a></p>
<p>When a species of work requires special current expenses to be made in
order to its proper performance, these also should of course be made good
to the workman in his wages. Most intellectual labor, for instance,
requires quiet surroundings. The brain-worker cannot share his study with
his family, and, therefore should receive wages or remuneration large
enough in amount to enable him to arrange his dwelling accordingly. A
similar circumstance, only in a much higher degree, enhances the price paid
for diplomatic service.</p>

 Even in the case of mere manual labor, for instance, a skillful packer of

 Thus, the Greek juggler, who understood how to throw lintels from a
 certain distance through the eye of a needle, was very appropriately
 rewarded by his king with a bushel of lintels. On the other hand, the high
 fee paid for an operation for cataract depends both on the great
 importance of the eye which cannot be replaced in any way, and on the
 rarity of the courage among doctors to pierce the eye of a living man.
 Very remarkable achievements, which it requires great education to
 understand, are generally paid for at a very low rate. (<i>Stein</i>,

 I need only recall <i>Richelieu</i> and <i>Mazarin</i>, the last of whom

 those who are skilled in rapidly effecting changes of form. The so-called
 <i>premières de modes</i> frequently received more than 1,800 francs a
 year, while the <i>apprêteuses</i> received only from 15 to 20 sous a day.
 (Revue des deux Mondes, Sept. 15, 1850.) There are women there paid very
 well for making pin-cushions, pen-wipers, etc., each one of a different
 form; but as soon as any one form ceases to be a novelty, the wages paid
 for making it sinks to a minimum. (<i>M. Mohl</i>,

 Wages in the country are generally lower than in the cities. In the
 electorate of Hesse, for instance, on the supposition of steady
 employment, males, in the country, received 69 thalers, 23 silver
 groschens a year; females, 55 thalers, 9 silver groschens; in the cities,
 on the other hand, males, 88 thalers, 23 silver groschens, and females 61
 thalers, 28 silver groschens. (<i>Hildebrand</i>,<a id="fnanchor_TN10"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN10">[TN
 10]</a> statistische Mittheilungen, 101, 137.) And so, according to
 <i>Colquhoun</i>, Treatise on Indigence, 1806, the English agricultural
 laborers received, on an average, £31 per annum, and manufacturing
 workmen, £55. The reason of this is, besides the greater facility of
 learning how to perform agricultural labor, the greater dearness of living
 in cities, and in England also, because industry has developed much more
 rapidly than agriculture.</p>

 The cost of bringing up a common laborer, in England, according to
 <i>Senior</i>, is £40; a gentleman, £2,040. (Outlines, 205.) The more
 expensive an education which one acquires for its own sake and without any
 special object beyond this in view, is, the less can the capital laid out
 in it affect wages. (<i>von Mangoldt</i>, V. W. L., 382.)</p>

 If the salaries of clergymen are, on an average, lower than the income of
 a lawyer or a doctor, it is partly because theological candidates are
 provided for much earlier, and partly because of the lesser cost attending
 the study of theology. Thus, at the end of the eighteenth century, there
 were 350 students at the University of Tubingen who are maintained gratis,
 on foundation-money, and who had previously attended monastery schools,
 free of charge. (<i>Nicolai</i>, Reisebescreibungen, XI, 73.) The
 remarkable contrast between the high wages of the Athenian sophists and
 the low wages of modern abbés, Adam Smith accounts for principally by the
 many scholarships of modern times. In Saxony, in 1850 etc., the outlay by
 the state and of foundation-funds for the education of a student amounted
 to an average of nearly 140 thalers. (<i>Engel.</i>)</p>

<p class="center smaller">DIFFERENCE OF WAGES IN DIFFERENT BRANCHES OF
LABOR.<br>
(CONTINUED.)</p>
<p>B. The great economic risk of the work. When a branch of labor necessary
to a country is, notwithstanding, attended <span class="pagenum">[Pg
60]</span> by many chances of failure to the individual who devotes himself
to it, a sufficient supply of the labor can be relied on only in case that
the danger attending it is compensated for by a corresponding premium paid
to success.<a id="fnanchor_168-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_168-1">[168-1]</a> The choice of a
profession or avocation, Adam Smith has compared to a lottery, in which the
fortunate winners gain only what the unfortunate have lost. The greater the
prizes, the greater also the number of blanks.<a id="fnanchor_168-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_168-2">[168-2]</a> However, the surplus wages in risky kinds of labor
are not sufficient to constitute a full insurance premium. This is
connected with the vanity of men who, as a rule, over-estimate not only
their talent but their good fortune,<a id="fnanchor_168-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_168-3">[168-3]</a> and especially in youth, when they decide on the
choice of a profession, etc. According to this, wages must be specially low
where even complete failure does not <span class="pagenum">[Pg 61]</span>
endanger the living or the social position of the workman. Partly on this
account are the industries carried on by women so poorly remunerated;<a id="fnanchor_168-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_168-4">[168-4]</a> as also such work as is done by a large class
of people to fill up their leisure hours.<a id="fnanchor_168-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_168-5">[168-5]</a></p>
<p>The prospect of frequent interruptions in any kind of labor must have
the same effect on the wages paid for it as its economic or business
risk.<a id="fnanchor_168-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_168-6">[168-6]</a> Thus, for instance, a mason
or roofer must earn at least enough, during the days he can work, to enable
him to live during the time he is prevented working by bad weather. Hence,
the highness of his wages <span class="pagenum">[Pg 62]</span> may, in some
respects, be called an apparent one.<a id="fnanchor_168-7"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_168-7">[168-7]</a> Wages paid by the week more generally tend to
equality than wages paid by the day, and more so yet wages paid by the
year, for then winter and summer compensate the one for the other. When the
workman must be ever ready to perform his task, account must be taken not
only of the number of hours he is engaged, but also of fractions of his
waiting hours, which must be paid for likewise.<a id="fnanchor_168-8"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_168-8">[168-8]</a> Two half days cost almost everywhere more than one
whole one.</p>
<p>The number of holidays plays a very important part here. In Protestant
countries, the workman must, in about three hundred work days, earn enough
to live on for about sixty holidays as well. In Catholic countries, before
the time of Clement XIV., he had to earn enough in addition to support
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 63]</span> himself for about one hundred and
fifty holidays, on ninety of which he performed no work whatever.<a id="fnanchor_168-9"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_168-9">[168-9]</a> So large a number of holidays produces a
higher rate of wages or necessitates a low standard of life among the
working classes.<a id="fnanchor_168-10"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_168-10">[168-10]</a> Something similar is
true of evening leisure and rest;<a id="fnanchor_168-11"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_168-11">[168-11]</a> <i>i. e.</i>, of the time when labor ceases.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_168-1"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_168-1" class="pginternal">[168-1]</a>
 The greater the preparatory cost of labor is, the more difficult it is for
 workmen to go from one kind of labor to another; but, at the same time,
 the more certain it is that, without the inducement of a premium paid,
 there will be no after increase or recruiting of labor-force.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_168-2"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_168-2" class="pginternal">[168-2]</a>
 Thus, for instance, in the country, where doctors generally get along well
 enough, the most skillful never obtains any very distinguished position.
 But, in large cities, on the other hand, there is the greatest difference
 between first-class physicians and obscure practitioners. Great generals
 usually obtain a larger income and greater influence than great admirals;
 and so it is that prizes in the military lottery are greater, and there
 are therefore more blanks than in the naval lottery. The common soldier is
 almost everywhere worse paid than the common sailor. (<i>Adam Smith.</i>)
 To some extent, this depends on the prison-like life of the seaman in
 times of service, and in the absence of an attractive uniform. As to the
 extent that the lottery comparison is defective, see <i>Macleod</i>,
 Elements, 215.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_168-3"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_168-3" class="pginternal">[168-3]</a>
 Who, otherwise, would have anything to do with a lottery in which the mass
 of players were certain to lose, and the keeper of it to gain? And this
 accounts for the fact well known to all financiers, that the amount of the
 budget remaining the same, a greater eagerness to enter the military
 service of the country is inspired by endowing the higher positions
 munificently—provided they are attainable by all—and paying
 the lower ones in a very niggardly way, than when the pay is made more
 uniform. Something similar is to be observed in the ecclesiastical service
 of the Roman and Protestant churches, inasmuch as the former, considered
 from an economic point of view, offers more magnificent prizes, but also
 more blanks, while the latter divides its emoluments more equally.</p>

 As most seamstresses are, when the worst comes to the worst, supported by
 their parents, connections by marriage, brothers, etc., the condition of
 those who have to live by their needle must be a pretty hard one. Who is
 not familiar with the refrain to <i>Hood's</i> celebrated song of the
 shirt: "Oh God, that bread should be so dear, and flesh and blood so
 cheap!" There is a "distressed needlewoman's society" in London. They
 undoubtedly suffer from an overcrowding of their avocation, yet their
 chief desire is that the competition of all who do not live exclusively by
 the labor of their hands should be prohibited; for instance, that of
 seamstresses who are paid for their work outside of factories. (Edinb.
 Rev., 1851, 24.) In Paris, in 1845, the yearly earnings of women workers
 averaged 375 francs, their yearly wants 500 francs. (Journal des
 Economistes, X, 250.) This does not apply to female servants whose wages,
 especially in highly cultured localities as the vicinity of large cities
 (Holstein, Brandenburg), is very high. In England, the wages of female
 domestics is frequently higher than in the United States; and hence nearly
 two-thirds of all English girls between fifteen and twenty-five years of
 age serve as maids. <i>Browning</i>, Political and Domestic Condition of
 Great Britain, 413; <i>Carey</i>, Rate of Wages, 92. A remarkable
 indication that women thrive only in the family. (Compare § 250.)</p>

 Thus, the darning of stockings in the sandy parts of North Germany, in the
 Highlands of Scotland, in the Faroe Islands, and formerly, even in the
 ante-rooms of the Russian nobility. (<i>Schlözer</i>, Anfangsgründe der
 Staatswirthsch, I, 126.) Flax spinning and linen weaving in Westphalia and
 Ireland, and wool weaving in the East Indies. Manufacturing industries
 must be in a very highly developed condition, and machinery carried to a
 high degree of perfection to compete in price with these accessory
 industries. Cheapness of many products manufactured in convents and
 monasteries.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_168-6"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_168-6" class="pginternal">[168-6]</a>
 Among these interruptions, may also be reckoned the prospect the laborer
 has of being early incapacitated for work, and thus of seeing himself cut
 off from every other source of support. This is one of the principal
 reasons why opera singers are generally better paid than actors.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_168-7"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_168-7" class="pginternal">[168-7]</a>
 In Leipzig, in 1863, mason and carpenter journeymen earned during the
 summer, from twenty silver groschens to one thaler, ordinary garden
 workmen, 20 silver groschens, while shoemaker journeymen did not make much
 more than 3½ thalers a week, and manual laborers, only from 10 to 15
 silver groschens a day. The masons of Paris have the reputation of being
 the best patrons of the savings banks, and, on that account, are more
 exposed to being attacked by thieves than any other class.
 (<i>Frégier</i>, Des Classes dangereuses, II, 3, 1.) High wages paid for
 threshing in East Prussia, because, the workman during the winter can be
 employed in very few different kinds of labor, and therefore must earn his
 entire support by threshing. In Paris, of 101,000 persons engaged in
 industry in 1860, 6,400 had to calculate on no interruption of their work,
 the remaining number, however, lost with a certain degree of regularity,
 from 2 to 4 months a year. (Revue des deux Mondes, 15 Fév., 1865.) If the
 interruption can be so accurately estimated in advance that the workman
 may engage in some business for himself during the interval, as for
 instance when the workmen in the Bavarian breweries work during the summer
 as masons, its influence on wages decreases. (<i>Storch</i>, Handbuch, I,
 192.) As to how, in Switzerland, since 1850, the guaranty of full
 employment to masons in winter is considered as an addition to the wages
 of summer, see <i>Böhmert</i>, Arbeiterverhältnisse, I, 141.</p>

<i>Commissionaires</i>, hack-drivers, <i>Extraposthalter</i> in Germany,
 porters, nurses, guides, servants in watering places and countries visited
 by tourists. A London porter gets at least a shilling an hour. If employed
 by the day, he of course gets smaller wages. Image venders, who travel
 from house to house, sell their wares much lower at their own houses. The
 person who calls them in from the street is obliged to pay them not only
 for this one journey, but for several others which yielded them no
 profit.</p>

 If we call the minimum daily need or the absolute requirement of the
 workman = m, the rate of daily wages in the former case must amount to at
 least m + m/6; in the latter, on the other hand, to m + m/4. A Bavarian
 holiday estimated at a <i>minus</i> of much more than 1,000,000 florins.

<p>C. Lastly, the personal disagreeableness of the work, which must be
compensated for by higher wages. The uncleanness of a coal-worker's task,
that of the chimney-sweep, and the repulsive labor of the butcher, demand
high compensation, while other branches of business, themselves productive
of pleasure, and therefore engaged in by many for pleasure's sake only,
yield relatively little to those who engage in them as a regular
industry.<a id="fnanchor_169-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_169-1">[169-1]</a></p>
<p>To this category belong the kinds of labor which require extraordinary

in unusual <span class="pagenum">[Pg 64]</span> jeopardy.<a id="fnanchor_169-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_169-3">[169-3]</a> But, indeed, when the danger attending any
kind of work is made glorious by the romantic light of honor, or by still

whereas, scholars, poets, etc., leaving the charm inherent in their
occupations out of account, are for the most part remunerated only by the
honor paid them, and, not <span class="pagenum">[Pg 65]</span>
unfrequently, only by fame after they have gone hence.<a id="fnanchor_169-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_169-6">[169-6]</a> And yet their talents are so rare, the
preparation so laborious, the economic risk so great! Nor is there for the

Common intellectual labor is worse paid in our days than it was,
comparatively speaking, a generation ago; because the increased average
education makes it less burthensome to most people, and even seem
positively agreeable to many. It would, indeed, be a dangerous
retrogressive step towards barbarism, if it should come to such a pass,
that labor preponderantly intellectual should be permanently more poorly
remunerated than mere muscular labor.<a id="fnanchor_169-7"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_169-7">[169-7]</a> <a id="fnanchor_169-8"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_169-8">[169-8]</a></p>

 The high wages paid to mowers and threshers may be accounted for on this
 ground (§ 160). In countries that have a strong heavy soil, wages are
 frequently 20 per cent. higher than under circumstances otherwise similar
 where it is sandy or light. In Mexico, a digger gets about twice the wages
 of an agricultural laborer. (<i>Senior</i>, On the Value of Money,

 Almost every trade predisposes to some special disease. Compare

 publique et privée, 1850, II, 755. It has been noticed, in Sheffield, that
 thoughtless steel polishers look unfavorably on certain new inventions
 intended to protect workmen against inhaling small particles of stone and
 iron dust. They dread that if these inventions come into general use,
 their wages would be lowered in consequence; and prefer a short and merry
 life to one longer and more quiet.</p>
<p class="footnote">In places in which nearly all kinds of work are
 dangerous, the danger cannot of course relatively raise the wages of
 anyone. Thus, in the Thuringian forest, the wages of the haulers of wood
 are very low. (<i>Lotz</i>, Revision, III, 151.)</p>

 Missionaries! Besides the extremely small wages paid to common soldiers
 (in the German infantry only 36.5 thalers cash per annum, to which in
 Leipzig, for instance, rations, etc., add about 34 thalers more) is an
 outlay made by the government principally to effect a levy of the tax of
 the compulsory labor that lies in conscription. (<i>Knies.</i>) In the
 volunteer system, the difference between officers and men is wont to be
 much smaller. Thus, <i>Gustav Wasa</i> paid his German mercenaries as
 follows: 6 marks a month to captains, five to lieutenants and 4 to common
 soldiers. (<i>Geijer</i>, Schwed. Gesch., II, 125 seq.) Similarly in the
 case of the Greek hired troops. (<i>Böckh</i>, Staatshaushalt der Athener,

 money is increased, and positions as officers most sought after, see

 Thus, for instance, the skinning or flaying of dead animals is

 The high wages of actors, singers, dancers, and especially of the female
 members of the stage, depends principally on the contempt with which they
 were formerly looked upon; excommunicated by the Catholic church, and a
 scarcely milder sentence passed upon them by the Protestant, until about
 the middle of the eighteenth century. (<i>Schleiermacher</i>, Christliche
 Sitte, 681.) Compare even <i>J. J. Rousseau</i>, Lettre sur les Spectacles

<i>Schiller's</i> "Theilung der Erde." <i>Blanqui</i> says of the learned:
 "They are most frequently satisfied with a citizen-crown, and think
 themselves remunerated when justice has been done to their genius. Their
 magnanimity impels them, to their own injury, to diffuse their knowledge
 as rapidly as possible. Thus they are like the light of day which no one
 pays for, but which all enjoy, without thanking the giver as they ought."
 The reward of intellectual labor is called an <i>honorarium</i>.
 (<i>Riehl</i>, Die Deutsche Arbeit, 1861, 232.) According to <i>J. B.
 Say</i>, Traité, II, ch. 7, the poor wages of savants depends on the fact
 that they take to market, and all at once, a great quantity of what they
 produce, which cannot even be used up.</p>

 relatively, most. (<i>Tooke</i>, Hist. of Prices, VI, 177.) It would be a

 The high wages paid to engineers on railroads is accounted for by the
 wear, physical and mental, their employment entails, and also by their
 unavoidable expenses away from home; further, by the importance of the
 interests confided to their trust. On the Leipzig-Dresden Railway,
 locomotive engineers, for the most part previously journeymen blacksmiths,
 earned 900 thalers a year. Similarly, in the case of pilots. The high
 wages paid on board ships engaged in the slave-trade arose from the
 unhealthiness of the African coast, where formerly one-sixteenth of the
 crew died yearly (Edinburg Rev., 480), from the moral turpitude of the
 business, and from the severe penalties under which it was afterwards
 prohibited. On the other hand, the low wages paid to European mining
 laborers is largely the consequence of the certainty of being cared for in
 old age, of those so employed. Weavers' wages are low because the facility
 of learning the trade makes it possible for the business to be carried on
 at home; and hence there is a comparatively great pressure to engage in
 it. (<i>Baines</i>, History of the Cotton Manufacture, 485 ff.)</p>
<p class="footnote">According to the first annual report of the poor law

<p>Custom always exerts a great influence where there is question of
choosing an avocation with the intention of devoting <span class="pagenum">[Pg 67]</span> one's self to it entirely and exclusively.
There is a public opinion which fixes the gradation of the different
classes of labor and their appropriate reward, which is slow to change, and
which both determines, and is determined by the relation of supply and
demand. There is an equilibrium between the pleasantness of work and the
rate of wages only in the case of such kinds of labor as are on the same
social footing. It frequently happens, however, that the most repulsive
work has to be performed by those who are forced to accept any pay and to
be satisfied with it.<a id="fnanchor_170-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_170-1">[170-1]</a> There are many branches
of labor those engaged in which still form a kind of exclusive caste; and
the pay of the higher branches is maintained at a high rate, especially by
the fact that the members of the castes to which they belong are provident
in their marriages. The lower classes are not in a condition to meet the
preparation necessary to engage in such professions, even if they were
certain of being afterwards reimbursed with interest for the outlay.<a id="fnanchor_170-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_170-2">[170-2]</a> One of the chief causes of the lowness of
wages paid to women is, that so few branches of labor are traditionally
open to them, that the few that are, are intended to supply luxuries, and
are, besides, for the most part, over-crowded. The distribution of the
aggregate wages earned by any industry, among the higher and lower classes
of workmen who coöperate in it, depends very largely on their social
position relatively to one another.<a id="fnanchor_170-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_170-3">[170-3]

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 68]</span>Thus, the artificial increase of the
wages of masters effected by the former guild-system was produced, to say
the least, as much at the cost of the journeymen and apprentices as of the
public. And if, on the other hand, it cannot be said that the most recent
marked rise in wages, in so many countries, is merely the consequence of
the extension of the parliamentary right of suffrage, certain it is that
the two phenomena are very closely related, and that both are at once the
effect and the cause of the intensified feeling of individuality and of the
consciousness of constituting a class in the community of the lower strata
of society.</p>

 Compare <i>J. S. Mill</i>, Principles, II, ch. 14, 3d ed. The dangerous
 industries in which lead, quicksilver, arsenic, etc. are manipulated or
 employed, should be and can be better paid than they actually are. In the
 Bavarian Palatinate, stone-cutters rarely reach their 45th year; and yet
 their wages are very low, because of the comparative over-population of
 the country. (<i>Rau</i>, <i>Haussen's</i> Archiv., N. T. X., 228.) But
 the lowness of wages here is certainly and mainly caused by the little
 thought the workmen themselves give to considerations of health.</p>

<p>In very low stages of civilization, where there is scarcely any such

<i>Adam Smith</i>, Wealth of Nat., I, ch. 8. Thus in the case of nations
 of hunters. The wages of free laborers in Russia, at the beginning of this
 century, were so high that mowers, in the vicinity of Moscow, received a
 good half of the corn mowed by them, (<i>von Schlözer</i>, Aufangsgründe,
 I, 65.) As a rule, the natural relation of the three branches of income is
 here postponed by the intervention of slavery. (§ 76, 155.) But, for
 instance, since the negroes have been emancipated, in the southern states
 of the American Union, it has become necessary to promise them one-half of
 the cotton crop as wages, and for the employer to run all the risk of a
 bad harvest. (<i>R. Somers</i>, The Southern States since the War, 1871.)

<p>When, where a nation's economy<a id="fnanchor_172-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_172-1">[172-1]</a> is growing and flourishing, capital increases more
rapidly than population, there is a search for employment by capital still
greater than the search <span class="pagenum">[Pg 70]</span> for employment
by labor. The consequence is, of course, a decline in the rate of interest,
and a rise in the rate of the wages of labor, although the latter may be
compelled to surrender a part of its increase to rent, which also rises. If
simultaneously with these phenomena, there have been great advances made in
national productive skill, especially in the cultivation of land; if,
therefore, labor and the capital consumed have become more prolific, the
condition of the laboring class is improved in a two-fold manner; the
condition of capitalists needs, to say the least, grow no worse, and the
increase of rent paid to landowners may be avoided.<a id="fnanchor_172-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_172-2">[172-2]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 71]</span>This favorable development is most
striking in the colonies of rich and highly civilized parent countries,
where the labor, capital and social customs of an old and ripe civilization
are found together with the overflowing natural forces inherent in a virgin
soil, engaged in the work of economic production. Here the growth of
national wealth is most rapid; and the rate of wages is here wont to be
highest.<a id="fnanchor_172-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_172-3">[172-3]</a> With the high rate <span class="pagenum">[Pg 72]</span> of interest that obtains where capital is

capitalists. In North America, and especially in the western part,<a id="fnanchor_172-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_172-4">[172-4]</a> it is very frequently in the normal course of

 In England, wages from 1400 to 1420, estimated in produce, were much
 higher than from 1500 to 1533. (Statist. Journal, 1861, 544 ff.) Later, a
 quarter of wheat was earned by day labor as follows: under Elizabeth, in
 about 48 days; during the seventeenth century, in 43 days; between 1700
 and 1766, in 32 days; between 1815 and 1848, in from 19 to at most 28¾
 days. (<i>Hildebrand</i>, Nat. Oek. der Gegenwart und Zukunft.) Since 1860,
 it has been earned in about 14 days. About 1668, the wages paid to English
 laborers and servants was one-third higher than twenty years before.
 (<i>Sir J. Child</i>, Discourse on Trade, p. 43 of the French
 translation.) <i>D. Defoe</i>, Giving Alms no Charity, 1704, draws a much
 more favorable picture of the time next succeeding. <i>Adam Smith</i>,
 Wealth of Nat., I, ch. 8, shows how money-wages, in the eighteenth
 century, were higher and the price of corn lower than in the seventeenth
 century. Between 1737 and 1797, wages in most parts of England, except in
 the immediate neighborhood of the great cities, doubled. (<i>Eden</i>, I,
 385.) In Scotland, about the year 1817, the wages of married farm
 servants, expressed in corn, were about 60 per cent. higher than in 1792.
 (<i>Sinclair</i>, Grundgesetze des Ackerbaues, 105.)</p>
<p class="footnote"><i>Boisguillebert</i>, Traité des Grains, I, 2,
 estimates the wages in France, for agricultural laborers, at least from 7
 to 8 sous, of present money, and at twice that amount in harvest time. In
 1697, laborers in Paris received from 40 to 50 sous. (Détail de la France,
 I, ch. 1, ch. 7.) <i>Vauban</i> estimates wages in large cities at 22½-45
 sous; for country manual laborers, at 18 sous; for agricultural laborers,
 12-13-1/5 sous. (Project d'une Dime royale, 89 Daire.) On the other hand,
 <i>Chaptal</i>, De l'Industrie, Fr. I, 245, 1819, speaks of an average
 wage—25 sous. <i>Dureau de la Malle</i>, Economie polit. des
 Romains, I, 151, allows agricultural laborers, in 80 departments of
 France, only 20-25 sous. According to <i>Moreau de Joannés</i>, Journal
 des Econ., Oct. 1850, the average wages of a French agricultural family
 amounted per annum, in 1700, to 135 francs; in 1760, to 126; in 1788, to
 161; in 1813, to 400; in 1840, to 500 francs. While <i>A. Young</i>,
 Travels in France, 1787-89, speaks of wages of 20 sous a day;
 <i>Peuchet</i>, Statist. élémentaire, 1805, 361, assumes it to be 30 sous,
 although the price of corn was not much higher. Compare <i>Birkbeck</i>,
 Agricultural Tour of France, 13, who is of opinion even, that French
 laborers are better situated than the English (?). From 1830 to 1848,
 wages decreased about 30 per cent. (<i>L. Faucher</i>, Revue des deux
 Mondes, Avril, 1848.) <i>Levasseur</i>, Histoire des Classes ouvrières en
 France, II, 1858.</p>
<p class="footnote">General data for whole countries are obviously very
 doubtful. In Germany, for instance, economically active places have
 witnessed an undoubted elevation of the condition of the laboring classes.
 Thus, in Hamburg and Lower Saxony, about the end of the eighteenth century
 (<i>Büsch</i>, Geldumlauf, II, 56 ff.); while in Thuringia, in 1556, a
 <i>sümmer</i> of rye was earned by 7 summer days' labor, and in 1830 ff.
 by 8. (<i>Lotz</i>, Handbuch, I, 404.) In Hessen, also, there has been but
 a very small increase in wages. <i>(Hildebrand,</i> Nat. Oek., I, 190.)
 According to <i>von der Goltz</i>, Ländliche Arbeiterfrage, 1872, 84 seq.,
 wages in the country during the last twenty or thirty years have increased
 on an average, 50 per cent. at least; in Bavaria about 100 per cent.; in
 the Rhine province, male wages, about 100; female wages, from about 75 to
 100 per cent. The masterly investigations of the wages of typesetters in
 Jena and Halle by <i>Strasburger</i> in <i>Hildebrand's</i> Jahrb., 1872,
 I ff., show that from 1717 to 1848, there was scarcely any change in them.
 A million m's was paid for in 1717-40 with 26.93 Prussian <i>sheffels</i>
 of rye; 1804-47 with from 24.80 to 28.80. Since then, a remarkable rise;
 so that in 1871, up to November, 76.26 was reached. The prices of food,
 dwellings, fuel, clothing, such as is in demand by such laborers, rose
 between 1850 and 1860, 16.7 per cent., and the wages for 1,000 m's in the
 same period of time rose about 14.3 and 43.7 per cent. In the industrious
 manufacturing vicinity of Moscow, wages in 1815 were four times as high as
 in 1670, while the means of subsistence rose relatively much less.

 In the United States, the wages of carpenters and masons, about the end of
 the last century, were $0.62 and $0.75; in 1835, of the former from $1.12
 to $1.25, and for the latter from $1.37 to $1.50. In 1848, the general
 wage was $0.75. The price of corn, in the meantime, did not rise, and the
 price of manufactured articles was much smaller. (<i>Carey</i>, Rate of
 Wages, 26 seq.; Past, Present and Future, 154.) In New York, as far back
 as 1790, wages were much higher (<i>Ebeling</i>, Geschichte und
 Erdbeschreibung von Nordamerika, II, 917); and between 40 and 50 years
 ago, a journeyman mason might earn over 700 thalers per annum.
 Agricultural laborers, in 1835, got $9 a month and their board, valued at
 $65 for the whole year. In the vicinity of large cities, both were higher.
 (<i>Carey</i>, 91.) The condition of the factory hands, in Lowell, is a
 very good one. In 1839, more than 100 of them had over $1,000 each in the
 savings banks, and pianos at their mess places. (<i>Boz</i>, Notes on
 America, 1842.) Most of them could save $1.50 a week. <i>Colton</i>, in
 his Public Economy (1849), says that a workman would consider himself in a
 bad way if he could not save half of his wages. Compare <i>Chevalier</i>,
 Lettres sur l'Amérique, II, 174, 122, 19; I, 221 ff.</p>
<p class="footnote">Apprentices in the United States, in almost every
 instance, begin to be paid wages as soon as their work begins to prove
 useful. The work of half-grown children, who had not yet left the parental
 roof, was so well paid that it was estimated that a child earned for his
 parents, on the whole, £100 more than he cost them. What an incentive to
 marriage! (<i>Adam Smith</i>, Wealth of Nat., I, ch. 8.) In Canada,
 agricultural laborers earn between £24 and £30 per annum and their board.
 In and around Melbourne, agricultural laborers got from 15 to 20 shillings
 a week and lodging; herdsmen, £35 to £40 a year; girls, from £20 to £45
 (Statist. Journal, 1872, 387 ff.); female cooks, from £35 to £40; male
 cooks, from £52 to £156. In hotels, girls, from £30 to £35; female cooks,
 from £50 to £100; domestic servants, £39 to £52; carpenters, masons, etc.,
 10 shillings a day; the best tailors, from 60 to 75 shillings a week;
 shoemakers, from 40 to 55 shillings; bakers, from 40 to 60 shillings a
 week. (Statist. Journal, 1871, 396 seq.) In San Francisco, a short time
 since, servant girls got $25 a month; Chinese, $1 a day; common laborers,
 $2; skilled artisans, from $3 to $5. (<i>Whymper</i>, Alaska, 299, 326.)
 The wages of a European tradesman, in Rio Janeiro, was from I to 2 Spanish
 piasters a day. (<i>Martius</i>, Reise, I, 131.) In the English West
 Indies, a new-born negro was formerly worth £5. (<i>B. Edwards</i>,
 History of the West Indies, II, 128.) The high wages paid in young
 colonies are frequently made temporarily still higher, by a large influx
 of capital in the shape of money, brought by emigrants, and by government
 outlays. Thus, in Van Diemen's land, for instance, in 1824, carpenters,
 masons, etc. got 12 shillings a day; in 1830, 10; in 1838, only from 6 to
 7, although between 1830 and 1838, the export trade of the island trebled
 while the population scarcely doubled. (<i>Merivale</i>, On Colonies, II,

connected with a flourishing condition of national life. It proves on the
one hand, great productiveness of the public economy of the people
generally: prudence, self-respect and self-control, even of the lowest
classes, virtues, which, however, are found, on the whole, only where
political liberty exists, and where the lowest classes are rightly valued
by the higher.<a id="fnanchor_173-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_173-3">[173-3]</a> On the other hand, it
produces a condition <span class="pagenum">[Pg 74]</span> of the great
majority of that portion of the population who have to support themselves
on the wages they receive, worthy of human beings, a condition in which
they can educate their children, enjoy the present and provide for the
future. Equality before the law and participation in the affairs of
government are empty phrases, and even tend to inflame the passions, where
the rate of wages is not high. When the lower classes are dissatisfied, in
highly civilized countries, with the sensitiveness and mobility of the
whole national life, there can be no certainty of the freedom of the middle
classes or of the rule of the upper. Here, in other respects, also, the
philanthropy of employers harmonizes remarkably well with their reasonable
self-interest. According to § 40, only the well-paid workman can accomplish
anything really good, just as, conversely, only the good workman is on the
whole, and in the long run, well paid. This suggests the physiological law,
that where muscular activity is great, nutrition must be great, likewise;
and the rapid waste and repair of tissues strengthens the muscles and gives
tone to the whole physical life. With a correct insight into the relations
of things, antiquity described its greatest worker, Herakles, as a great
eater also. A well-paid workman, who costs and accomplishes as much in a
day as two bad ones, is cheaper than they. He works much more cheerfully
and faithfully, is, hence, more easily superintended, is less frequently
sick, and later decrepid.<a id="fnanchor_173-4"></a>

 l'aisance du peuple par le travail a nui à son obéissance,
 (Forbonnais.)</i> This is true only of well governed countries. When, in
 England, about the middle of the eighteenth century, a great improvement
 took place in the condition of the laboring classes, <i>Postlethwayt</i>
 (Great Britain's commercial Interests, 1759) was one of the first to
 recognize its general beneficial character; also <i>Th. Mortimer</i>.
 (Elements of Commerce, Politics and Finance, 1774, 82 ff.) <i>Benjamin
 Franklin</i>, before the American revolution, was of opinion that high
 wages made people lazy. (On the Price of Corn, 1776. On the laboring Poor,
 1768.) He afterwards, however, acknowledged its generally good effect, and
 that even the products of labor might be cheapened thereby. (On the
 Augmentation of Wages, which will be occasioned in Europe by the American
 Revolution. Works II, 435 ff.) See further, <i>Paoletti</i>, Veri Mezzi di
 render felici le Società, ch. 15; <i>Ricardo</i>, Principles, ch. 5;
 <i>Th. Brassey</i>, on Work and Wages, 1872. <i>Umpfenbach</i>, Nat. Oek,
 181, calls the costliness of labor to the purchaser of labor, "givers'
 wages," their purchasing power to the laborer himself, "receivers' wages,"
 and is of opinion, that as civilization advances, the former declines and
 the latter rises.</p>

 When in the department of the Tarn flesh food was introduced among
 journeymen smiths instead of mere vegetable diet, the sanitary improvement
 that followed was so great that the number of days lost by sickness in a
 year decreased from 15 to 3. (<i>Moleschott</i>.)</p>

 In high stages of civilization, it is always more profitable, the result
 being the same, to keep a few well fed cattle than many poorly fed.
 (<i>Roscher</i>, Nationalök. d. Ackerbaues, § 179.) <i>Infra</i>, § 231.
 When the drainage of Oxford street in London was made while wages were
 rising, it happened that the cubic foot of masonry work at 10 shillings
 per day was cheaper than it was formerly at 6 shillings per day.
 (<i>Brassey</i>, 68 ff.) <i>Senior</i> calls it an absurdity to consider
 the high wages paid in England as an obstacle in the way of its successful
 competition with other countries. Rather would he consider it as the
 necessary result of the excellence of English labor. Thus, in his Lectures
 on the mercantile Theory of Wealth, p. 76, he says that if the English
 employ a part of their labor injudiciously, they must pay it not in
 proportion to what it really accomplishes, but to what it might do if well
 employed. If a man calls in a doctor to cut his hair, he must pay him as a
 doctor. If he puts a man to throwing silk who might earn 3 ounces of
 silver a week spinning cotton, he must pay him weekly 3 ounces of silver,
 although he may deliver no more silk within that time than an Italian who
 gets only 1½ ounces.</p>

 Norfolk country workmen never worked more than 10 hours a day except in
 harvest and seed time. But a plowman there accomplished as much in 5 days
 as another in 8. (<i>Marshall</i>, Rural Economy of N., 138.) In
 southwestern Germany, the country working day is from 2 to 4 hours shorter
 than in the northeast, and yet just as much is accomplished in the former
 quarter. (<i>von der Goltz</i>, Ländl. Arbeiterfrage, 88, 131.) Thus the
 coal diggers of South Wales work 12 hours a day, those of Northumberland,
 7; and yet the same achievement is 25 per cent. dearer in case of the
 former. In the construction of the Paris-Rouen Railroad, the English
 achieved more than the French, although the former worked from 6 A. M. to
 5:30 P. M., and the latter from 5 A. M. to 7 P. M. (<i>Brassey</i>, 144
 ff.) Examples from English manufactories in <i>Marx</i>, Kapital, I, 401
 seq. In an English factory the hours worked were 12, and afterwards, 11.
 This caused the number of attendants of the evening school to grow from 27
 to 98. (<i>Horner.</i>) <i>Dollfuss</i>, in Mühlhausen, reduced the number
 of hours worked from 12 to 11, and let the wages remain the same as
 before. The result was besides a great saving made in fuel and light, a
 surplus product of at least 1-2/3 per cent. Something similar observed by
 <i>M. Chevalier</i>, Cours, I, 151.</p>
<p class="footnote">Hence <i>J. Möser</i>, Patr. Ph., III, 40, desired, on
 this account, that work in the evening should be prohibited by law. In
 England, not only the moral necessity, but also the economic general
 utility of leisure time of workmen has been defended, among others by
 <i>Postlethwayt</i>, Dictionary of Trade and Commerce, I, prelim.
 Discourse, 1751. A beautiful law, V Moses 24, 15. Only, care must be taken
 not to go to the other extreme, which is still more detrimental to
 personality. The North American ideal of 8 hours a day for work, 8 for
 eating, sleeping, etc., and 8 for leisure, would be injurious except to
 workmen intellectually very active. But the provision to be met with in
 many states of the Union and in the arsenal employ of the government, that
 in case of doubt, the work day is to be tacitly assumed as of 8 hours,
 has, it is said, correspondingly lowered wages. See <i>supra</i>, §
 168.</p>

 In India, where the institution of caste is found, nearly half the year is
 made up of feast days, while in rationalistic China there is no Sunday and
 very few general holidays. (<i>Klemm</i>, A. Kulturgeschicht. VI, 425.
 <i>Wray</i>, The practical Sugar Planter, 1849.) The Judaic-Christian
 sanctification of the seventh day is a happy medium between these two
 extremes. Recuperation and collectedness get their due without its costing
 too much to action. <i>Ora et labora!</i> Compare <i>Sismondi</i>, N. P.
 II, ch. 5. Which is best, traveling on foot, to drag along all the time,
 or to walk decently and rest properly between times? The rest of Sunday,
 even leaving the work of recuperation and edification out of account, is
 necessary in the interests of the family and of cleanliness. The French
 <i>decadis</i> accomplished materially even too little: <i>ils ont à faire
 à deux ennemis, qui ne cèderont pas, la barbe et la chemise blanche</i>.
 (<i>B. Constant.</i>) Hence, an English prize essay on the material
 advantages of Sunday found 1,045 competitors among English working men.

 Thus <i>Parkinson</i>, A Tour in America, complains that with four
 servants in the house, he was obliged to polish his own shoes, and with
 his wife and children to milk the cows, while his people were still
 asleep. Strange servants bringing a message, come in with their hats on.
 All domestics are called mister or misses. Servant maids are called
 "helps," and their masters, "employers." If a person at a hotel asks for a
 laundress, he is answered: "Yes, man, I will get a lady to wash your
 clothes." Similarly in <i>Fowler</i>, Lights and Shadows,... three Years'
 Experience in Australia. But, at the same time, it is remarkable how
 seldom a native born white American accepts a fee. On the other hand,
 Russia is the classic land of fees. There is a popular story in that
 country to the effect that when God divided the earth among the different
 nations, they were all satisfied except the Russians, who begged a little
 drink-money or fee in addition, (<i>von Haxthausen</i>, Studien, I, 70.)
 Similarly in Egypt. (<i>Ebers</i>, Durch Gosen zum Sinai, 1873, 31 seq.)
 The system of feeing servants holds a middle place between the modern
 system of paying for everything lawfully and the medieval system in which
 people either rob, donate or beg.</p>

 that the English poor rates cost more than if the laborers were obliged to
 provide for themselves by getting higher wages. (Principles, III, 7.) Sad
 results of the system which came into vogue in the South of England in
 1795, to supplement wages according to the price of corn and the number of

<i>Von Thünen</i>, Isolirte Staat., II, 1, 154, gives the following
 formula as the expression of ideal wages: √<span class="o">ap</span>, in which a = the necessary requirement for
 maintenance of the workmen, and p = the aggregate product of his labor.
 <i>von Thünen</i> attached so much importance to this formula that he had
 it engraved on his tomb-stone. But even if it were possible to reduce
 capital-generating labor and wage-labor to a common denominator, it would
 not be possible nor equitable to maintain the same dividing measure when
 capital and labor contributed in very different amounts to the production
 of the common product. An artist, for instance, who could make costly
 vessels out of very cheap clay and with cheap fuel would get too little by
 <i>von Thünen's</i> law; a mechanic who used a very efficient and costly
 machine, too much. The fundamental defect in his theory, <i>von Thünen</i>
 himself seems to have obscurely felt. Compare the letter in his

<p class="center smaller">HISTORY OF THE WAGES OF COMMON LABOR.—IN
DECLINING COUNTRIES AND TIMES.</p>
<p>When, circumstances being otherwise unaltered, the aggregate income of a
nation decreases, the wages of labor are wont to be lower in proportion as
the points above mentioned, and <span class="pagenum">[Pg 78]</span> which
are unfavorable to the laborer in his competition, appear.<a id="fnanchor_174-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_174-1">[174-1]</a> The worse distribution, also, of the national
resources, when, instead of a numerous middle class, a few over-rich people
monopolize all that is to be possessed, diminishes the wages of common
labor and thus again produces a worse distribution than before.<a id="fnanchor_174-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_174-2">[174-2]</a> In a similar way, wages must decline when the
mode of life of the laboring class, or the quality of their work, has
deteriorated. Some of these causes may exist transitorily <span class="pagenum">[Pg 79]</span> even among otherwise flourishing nations;
as, for instance, in war times,<a id="fnanchor_174-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_174-3">[174-3]</a>
or when population for a while grows more rapidly than national wealth. But
among nations universally declining, they are all wont to meet, and one
strengthens the other.<a id="fnanchor_174-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_174-4">[174-4]</a> One of the saddest
symptoms of such a condition is the low value here put upon the life and
strength of workmen. The cheapness of labor has indeed a charm for
enterprising spirits, <span class="pagenum">[Pg 80]</span> which induces
them to employ human labor even where machinery, beasts, etc., would
economically be better adapted to the performance of the work.<a id="fnanchor_174-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_174-5">[174-5]</a> Day-laborers are, on this account, more
profitable to persons of enterprise (<i>Unternehmer</i>=<i>undertaker</i>)
because they can more easily rid themselves of them. But such egotistic
calculation should have no place even in the case of actual slaves.<a id="fnanchor_174-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_174-6">[174-6]</a></p>
<p>Besides, it not unfrequently happens, that the laboring class seek to
oppose the decline of wages by increasing their industry, shortening their
holidays and leisure, and by drawing their wives and children into their
work. This may, under certain circumstances, result in an increase of the
national income, and thus constitute a transition to the restoration of
high wages, especially if beforehand there was reason to complain of the
idleness of the working class. But if the other circumstances of
competition are unfavorable to the working class, if especially they used
their personally increased income to add to the population, it would not be
long before they fell back to their previous state. In such case, the
consequence is, that the same quantity of labor has become cheaper; that
all permanent profit falls to the capitalists and landowners, and <span class="pagenum">[Pg 81]</span> all that remains to the laboring class is
only greater toil, a sadder home-life, and sadder children. The danger of
such an issue is all the greater, because few things so much contribute to
reckless marriages and the thoughtless procreation of children, as the
industrial coöperation of wife and child.<a id="fnanchor_174-7"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_174-7">[174-7]</a>

 The classic lands of low wages and pauperism are especially the East
 Indies and China. A minister of Kienlong was punished after he had
 extorted about 20,000,000 thalers. (<i>Barrow</i>, II, 149.) In the
 confiscation of the well known <i>Keschen</i>, the authorities, according
 to their own accounts, found 682 pounds of gold and more than 6,000,000
 pounds in silver. Considering the colossal<a id="fnanchor_TN12"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN12">[TN
 12]</a> banquets of the rich, embracing several hundred courses, of which
 <i>Meyen</i>, Reise um die Erde, II, 390, describes an example, the
 wretched food of the poor is doubly striking. Count <i>Görtz</i> relates
 that in Canton, rats and serpents are regularly exposed for sale. (Reise,
 445.) The lowness of wages appears from the fact—one of
 many—that servants frequently get nothing but their board.
 (<i>Haussmann</i>, Voyage en Chine, etc.) In the cities, tradesmen with
 their tools run hither and thither about the streets begging for
 employment in the most imploring manner. Thousands live all their lives on
 rafts. Numberless instances of infanticide from want of food, (§ 251.) The
 influence of these circumstances on the morality of the people is best
 illustrated by the fact that <i>Keschen</i>, when he was ambassador to
 Thibet, preferred to confide his newly collected treasures to the escort
 of the French missionaries he persecuted rather than to the mandarins
 named by himself, so much more highly did he estimate European than
 Chinese honesty. (Edinburg Rev., 1851, 425 ff.) In the Chinese
 picture-writing, the word happiness was designated by a mouth well corked
 with rice. Chinese statisticians speak of mouths (<i>Maul</i>) where ours
 treat of the number of heads or souls. <i>Ritter</i>, Erdkunde, II, 1060.
 More favorable accounts in <i>Plath</i>, Münch. Akad., 1873, 784, 788
 seq.</p>
<p class="footnote">In the East Indies, a great many of the rejected
 castes live on carrion, dead fish, noxious insects, and even the middle
 class find wheat flour too dear, and therefore mix it with peas, etc.
 (<i>Ritter</i>, VI, 1143.) It is said that Bengal, in the famine of 1770,
 lost more than one-third of its inhabitants. (<i>Mill</i>, History of
 British India, III, 432.) Eloquent description of misery in
 <i>Rickard</i>, India, or Facts submitted to illustrate the Character and
 Condition of the native Inhabitants, II, London, 1832. An immense number
 of badly paid servants of whom it may however be said that each one
 accomplishes very little. The Pindaries may pass for an extreme of Indian
 pauperism, corresponding to the pirate-calamity during the later Roman
 Republic. (Quarterly Review, XVIII, 466 ff.; <i>Ritter</i>, VI, 394
 ff.)</p>

 Thus, in England, during the last great war, wages rose less than the
 price of corn, and sank less after it. About 1810, wages were nearly 100
 per cent. higher than in 1767; but, on the other hand, the price of wheat,
 115; of meat, 146; of butter, 130, and of cheese, 153 per cent. (Edinburg
 Rev., XL., 28.) If it has some times been observed that crime, communistic
 machinations and revolutionary movements grow less frequent in times of
 war, the fact is not to be ascribed necessarily to a better condition of
 the laboring class. It might possibly be the consequence of the strongest
 and wildest elements of the laboring class finding some other career.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_174-4"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_174-4" class="pginternal">[174-4]</a>
<i>Adam Smith</i>, loc. cit., on this point describes China as a
 stationary country (according to <i>R. Fortune</i>, Wanderings in China,
 1847, 9, a decided decline has been noticeable there for a long time), and
 Bengal as a declining one. On the condition of wages among the Romans,
 <i>Juvenal</i>, III, 21 ff., is one of the principal sources. Hence the
 desire to emigrate because honest labor had no longer any foothold (23
 ff.). Poor dwellings of the laboring class, dark, exposed to danger from
 fire (166, 190 ff., 225), and yet comparatively dear (223 seq.). Numerous
 crowds of robbers and beggars (302 ff.; IV, 116 ff.; V, 8; XIV, 134). On
 beggary, see <i>Seneca</i>, Controv., V, 33. De Element., II, 6. De Vita
 beata, 25 ff. <i>Martial</i>, V, 81, XIV, 1, complains of the absence of
 outlook among the poorer classes. <i>Horace</i>, too, is rich in passages
 which might be appropriately cited in this connection. Characteristic
 question of the nabobs, in <i>Petron.</i>, 48, 5: What on earth is that
 thing called a pauper?</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_174-5"></a>

 Thus, in China, the East Indies, etc., people travel in palanquins borne
 by men; in a multitude of cases, Chinese commodities are carried in
 wheelbarrows; and a great many roads are constructed, in reference not to
 wagons, properly so-called, but to this species of vehicle. How heartless
 the Chinese, who, before they save a drowning man, first higgle about the
 reward, and take pleasure in pestilence, famine, etc., because those who
 survive profit by them. See <i>Finlaison</i>, Journey of the Mission to
 Siam, 1826, 62 ff.</p>

 Hence <i>Menander</i> (342-290 before Christ) says it is better to be the
 slave of a good master than to live wretched in freedom. (<i>Stobœus</i>,
 Flor., 62, § 7. <i>Meinecke</i>, Fr. com. Gr., IV, 274.) <i>Libanios</i>,
 too, (Tom., 483, Reiske), in his "Blame of Poverty," represents slavery as
 better cared for, and freer from worry. Horrible contracts made even in
 Cæsar's time, from want, by freemen, to become gladiator-slaves.
 <i>Cicero</i>, pro Roscio, Am. 6; <i>Horat.</i>, Serm., II, 7, 58 ff.;
 <i>Petron.</i>, 117; <i>Seneca</i>, Epist., 37. And so by Justinian, cases
 of declined freedom are supposed. (L. 15, <i>Justin.</i>, Cod., VII, 2.)
 "<i>Dans une armée on estime bien moins un pionnier, qu'un cheval de

 The bringing into juxtaposition of the rates of wages in different
 countries is doubtless one of the most important objects of comparative
 statistics. Only it is necessary not to confine it to the money amount of
 wages, but to make it embrace the prices of the principal means of
 subsistence. Thus, in France, before the outbreak of the French
 Revolution, a French workman earned a cwt. of bread on an average of 10.5
 days; one of meat in 36.8; an English workman, in 10.4 and 25.3 days.
 (<i>A. Young.</i>) In the interior of Russia, a female weaver earns, in a
 day, almost one Prussian <i>scheffel</i> of rye, in Bielefeld, only about
 one-tenth of a <i>scheffel</i>; a table-cloth weaver, in the former place,
 18 silver groschens, while the <i>scheffel</i> costs from 12 to 15 silver
 groschens. (<i>von Haxthausen</i>, Studien, I, 119, 170.) According to
 <i>Humboldt</i>, the money-wages paid in Mexico were twice as high, and
 the price of corn two-thirds as dear, as in France. (N. Espagne, IV, 9.)

 that the average rate of wages in Germany, in 1848, amounted to 400
 thalers a year; in England, to 300 thalers; and that the prices of the
 means of subsistence in the latter country were 1½ times higher than in
 the former. <i>Engel</i>, Ueber die arbeitenden Klassen in England, 1845,

<p class="center smaller">WAGE POLICY.—SET PRICE OF LABOR.</p>
<p>Among the artificial means employed to alter the existing rate of wages,
we may mention first, a rate of wages fixed by governmental authority.
These have, in many places, constituted an intermediate step between
serfdom and the free wage-system. In most cases, this measure was intended
in the interest of the upper classes to prevent the lower obtaining the
full advantage of their freedom under the favoring circumstances of
competition.<a id="fnanchor_175-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_175-1">[175-1]</a> In later times, another
cause has <span class="pagenum">[Pg 83]</span> frequently been added to
this, viz.: by diminishing the cost of production to increase foreign
sales. (See § 106.) In the higher stages of civilization, nations will
scarcely look with favor on the diminution of the rightful, for the most
part, individually small gains of the most numerous, the poorest and most
care-worn class of the community.<a id="fnanchor_175-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_175-2">[175-2]</a>
The purchasers of labor would, in consequence, be badly served, since they
would have lost the possibility of obtaining better workmen by paying
higher wages. Hence, there would, probably, be none but mediocre labor to
be found.<a id="fnanchor_175-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_175-3">[175-3]</a> On the other hand,
fixed rates which keep within the limits described in § 114 <span class="pagenum">[Pg 84]</span> are, under certain circumstances, desirable.
This is especially the case where the purchasers of labor on the one hand,
and the buyers of labor on the other, have formed themselves into united
groups, and where the rate fixed is only in the nature a treaty of peace
under governmental sanction, when a war over prices had either broken out
actually or there was danger to fear that one would break out. It must not
be forgotten, that thus far common labor has scarcely had any thing similar
to an "exchange."<a id="fnanchor_175-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_175-4">[175-4]</a></p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_175-1"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_175-1" class="pginternal">[175-1]</a>
 The plague known as the black death of 1348, which devastated the greater
 part of Europe, was followed by many complaints on the part of the buyers
 of labor, of the cupidity and malicious conspiracies of the working
 classes. (See <i>supra</i> § 160.) Fixed rates of wages under Peter the
 Cruel of Castile, 1351; contemporaneously in France, Ordonnances, II, 350,
 and in England, 25 Edw. III, c. 2; 37 Edw. III, c. 3. In France, the wages
 of a thresher were fixed at the one-twentieth or the one-thirtieth of a
 <i>scheffel</i>, while in present Saxony it is from one-fourteenth to
 one-twelfth. In England, under the same ruler, who had seen his castle at
 Windsor built, not by day laborers for wages, but by vassal masons, vassal
 carpenters, etc., whom he got together from all parts of the kingdom. That
 the rates might not be evaded, the succeeding king forbade both the
 leaving of agriculture for industry and change of domicile<a id="fnanchor_TN14"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN14">[TN 14]</a> without the consent of a justice of the peace. (12
 Richard II., c. 3.) All such provisions were little heeded in the 16th
 century. (<i>Rogers</i>, the Statist. Journal, 1861, 544 ff.)</p>
<p class="footnote">Fixed rates of wages under Henry VII. and Henry VIII.,
 in the interest of workmen. (<i>Gneist</i>, Verwaltungsrecht, II, Aufl.,
 461 ff.) The fact that in 5 Elizabeth, c. 4, another attempt was made to
 fix the rate of wages by governmental provisions, in which the person
 paying more than the sum fixed was threatened with 10 days' imprisonment,
 and the person receiving less with 12, was in part akin to the English
 poor laws. If a poor man had the right to be eventually employed and
 supported by the community, it was, of course, necessary that the justice
 of the peace should be able to determine at what wages anybody should be
 prepared to work before he could say: I can find no work. Extended by 2
 James I., c. 6, to all kinds of work for which wages were paid.
 (<i>Eden</i>, State of the Poor, V, 123 ff., 140.) The buyers of labor in
 the eighteenth century frequently complained that these fixed wages were
 more to the advantage of workmen than of their masters. (<i>Brentano</i>,
 English Guilds., ed. by <i>Toulmin Smith</i>, 1870, Prelim. CXCI.)</p>
<p class="footnote">In Germany, the depopulation caused by the Thirty
 Years' War explains why, before and after the peace of Westphalia, so many
 diets were concerned with fixing the rate of wages of servants. Compare
 <i>Spittler</i>, Gesch., Hanovers, II, 175. Among the most recent
 instances of English fixed rates of wages, is 8 George III., for London
 tailors, and the Spitalfields Act of 1773, for silk weavers who had, a
 short time before, revolted. Also in New South Wales, about the end of the
 last century, on account of the high rate of colonial wages.
 (<i>Collins</i>, Account of the English Colonies of New South Wales,
 1798.) Later, <i>Mortimer</i>, Elements of Politics, Commerce and Finance,
 1174, 72, maintains fixed rates of wages to be necessary. In Germany the
 imperial decree of 1830, tit., 24, and again the ordinance of Sept. 4,
 1871, provide that each magistrate shall fix the rate of wages in his own
 district. <i>Chr. Wolf</i>, Vernunftige Gedanken vom gesellsch. Leben der
 Menschen, 1721, § 487, would have the rates so fixed that the laborers
 might live decently and work with pleasure.</p>

 The Spitalfields Act was repealed in 1824, for the reason that the
 manufacturers themselves attributed the stationary condition of their
 industries for a hundred years to the fact that they were hampered by that
 act. <i>Ricardo's</i> and <i>Huskisson's</i> prophecies, on this occasion,
 fulfilled by the great impulse which the English silk industries soon
 afterwards received.</p>

 Compare <i>Brentano</i>, Arbeitergilden der Gegenwart, II, 288. However,
 fixed rates of wages equitably arranged, in the establishment of which
 neither party has been given an advantage over the other, have continued
 to exist much longer than our distrustful and novelty-loving age would
 think possible. Thus compositors' wages in London, from 1785 to 1800, from
 1800 to 1810, from 1810 to 1816, and from 1816 to 1866, remained
 unaltered; those of London ship builders, from 1824 to 1867; of London
 builders, from 1834 to 1853, and from 1853 to 1865. (<i>Brentano</i> II,

<p class="p2 center"><a id="S176"></a>SECTION CLXXVI.</p>
<p class="center smaller">WAGES-POLICY.—STRIKES.</p>
<p>Where the wages-receiving class feel themselves to be a special class,
<i>vis-a-vis</i> of the purchasers of their labor, they have frequently
endeavored, by the preconcerted suspension of labor upon a large scale, to
force their masters to pay them higher wages, or grant them some other
advantage.<a id="fnanchor_176-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_176-1">[176-1]</a> It is <span class="pagenum">[Pg 85]</span> hard to say whether such strikes have more
frequently failed or succeeded.<a id="fnanchor_176-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_176-2">[176-2]</a></p>
<p>As a rule, a war over prices, carried on by such means, and without
force on either side, must generally issue in the victory of the richer
purchasers of labor.<a id="fnanchor_176-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_176-3">[176-3]</a> The latter require the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 86]</span> uninterrupted continuation of labor
for their convenience and profit; but the workmen need it to live. It is
but seldom that the workmen will be in a condition to stop work for more
than a few months, without feeling the sting of hunger. The purchaser of
labor can live longer on his capital; and the victory here belongs to the
party who, in the struggle, holds out longest. Hence, a strike that lasts
more than six weeks may, for that reason alone, be considered a failure.
The employers of labor, on account of their smaller number and greater
education, make their counter-coalition much more secret and effective. How
many instances there are in which labor-saving machines have come into use
more rapidly than they otherwise would have come but for the influence of
these coalitions!<a id="fnanchor_176-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_176-4">[176-4]</a></p>
<p>On the other hand, it cannot be ignored that a host of workmen, by means
of an organization which provides them with a unity of will, such as the
heads of great enterprises naturally possess, must become much better
skilled in carrying on a struggle for higher wages. Where wages in general
tend to rise, but by force of custom, which is specially powerful here (§
170), are kept below their natural level, a strike may very soon attain its
end. And workmen are all the more to be wished God-speed here in proportion
as employers are slow to decide of their own motion upon raising wages, and
where, under <span class="pagenum">[Pg 87]</span> certain circumstances,<a id="fnanchor_176-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_176-5">[176-5]</a> a single cold-hearted master might force all
his competitors to keep wages down. If even the entire working class should
follow the example of the strikers, so that all commodities, in so far as
they are products of labor, should grow dearer to an extent corresponding
to the rise in wages, there would still remain an improvement of the
condition of the working class at the cost of the interest paid on capital
and the profits of enterprise. It is, of course, otherwise with the
struggle of workmen against the natural conditions which determine the rate
of their wages (§§ 161-166) in which they might, in turbulent times,
possibly succeed<a id="fnanchor_176-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_176-6">[176-6]</a> temporarily, but would,
in the long run, have to fail.<a id="fnanchor_176-7"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_176-7">[176-7]</a>
</p>
<p>The working class will be best fortified in such a struggle for higher
wages when their organization is a permanent one, and when they have taken
care, during good times, to collect a certain amount of capital to protect
their members, during their cessation from work, against acute want. This
is the object of the trades-unions as they have grown up in England,
especially since the total decline of the guild system and of governmental
provisions relating to apprentices, fixed rates of wages<a id="fnanchor_176-8"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_176-8">[176-8]</a> etc. But it cannot be denied that these
unions, although <span class="pagenum">[Pg 88]</span> democratic in form,
often exercise a very despotic sway over their members;<a id="fnanchor_176-9"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_176-9">[176-9]</a> that they have, so far as the employers of
labor are concerned, and the non-union laborers, gone back to a number of
measures, outgrowths of the guild and embargo systems, which it was fondly
hoped had been forever banished by the freedom of industry.<a id="fnanchor_176-10"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_176-10">[176-10]</a> What many <span class="pagenum">[Pg
89]</span> of the friends of this system hope it may accomplish in the
future, viz.: regulate the whole relation between capital and labor, and
thus, on the whole, control the entire public economy of a people,<a id="fnanchor_176-11"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_176-11">[176-11]</a> is, fortunately, all the more certainly a
chimera, as any national or universal approximation to this end would be
the most efficacious way to compel employers of labor to the formation of
corresponding and probably far superior opposing unions. Notwithstanding
this, however, I do not doubt that the recent development of trades-unions
in England is both a cause and an effect of the rise in wages in the
branches of industry in question, as well as of the moral elevation of the
condition of the working class which has simultaneously taken <span class="pagenum">[Pg 90]</span> place.<a id="fnanchor_176-12"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_176-12">[176-12]</a> The mere possibility of a strike is of itself
calculated, in the determination of the rate of wages, to procure for the
equitable purchaser of labor the desirable preponderance over the
inequitable.<a id="fnanchor_176-13"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_176-13">[176-13]</a></p>

 Even <i>Boisguillebert</i>, Traité des Grains, was acquainted with
 instances of this kind in which from 600 to 800 workmen simultaneously
 left their masters. There are much earlier instances in Italy. Thus, in
 Sienna, in 1381 and 1384, in which the nobility sided with the workmen.
 (Rerum Ital. Scriptores, XV, 224, 294.) Strikes of journeymen began to be
 much more frequent in Germany in the guilds, from the time of the prospect
 of their becoming masters themselves, and of their living in the family of
 the masters had decreased. On similar strikes at Spires,<a id="fnanchor_TN15"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN15">[TN 15]</a> in 1351, at Hagenau in 1409, and Mainz in 1423, see

 Strassb. Chr., II, 1025. A remarkable strike of the Parisian book printers
 under Francis I. (<i>Hildebrand's</i> Jahrb., 1873, II, 375 ff.) In
 so-called "home manufactures," where the "manufacturer" is both orderer,
 preparer and seller, but strikes are scarcely possible without much fixed
 capital. The strike of the factory spinners in Lancashire in 1810 caused
 30,000 workmen to stop work for four months.</p>
<p class="footnote">Among the next following coalitions of labor, those of
 the Glasgow weavers in 1812 and 1822 were very important. In the latter,
 two workmen who would not participate with the strikers were blinded with
 sulphuric acid. In 1818, great strike by the Scotch miners. The Preston
 strike of 1853 lasted 36 weeks. It is said that 6,200 male and 11,800
 female working people took part in it. (<i>Athenæum</i>, 30 Sept., 1854.)

 Instances of successful strikes: Fortnightly Review, Nov. 1865. Similarly
 in Germany, in 1865; but there, in truth, many strikes were only defensive
 and intended to restore the former thing-value of the declined money
 (Werke, XIII, 151). The English strikes, in 1866 and 1867, failed nearly
 all, so that wages again declined to their level in 1859, and in many
 places, to what they had been in the crisis-year 1857. (Ausland, 16 April,
 1868.) As to how even in Victoria, strikes which opposed a decline of
 wages from 16 to from 8 to 10 shillings a day failed, after doing great
 injury, see Statist. Journ., 1861, 129 ff.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_176-3"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_176-3" class="pginternal">[176-3]</a>
 The Preston strikers of 1853 got even from their non-striking colleagues,
 £30,000. Had their masters prevented this, the affair would have been
 terminated much sooner. (Quart. Rev., Oct. 1859.) But employers are much
 more frequently divided by rivalries than workmen, especially in strikes
 against new machines or when a manufacturer, who has too large a supply of
 goods on hand, desires a strike himself. On account of their smaller
 number, too, they are less in a condition to declare a recusant colleague
 in disgrace. <i>Adam Smith's</i> remark that coalitions of capitalists are
 much more frequent than those of workmen, only that much less is said of
 them, is hardly applicable to our time. (Wealth of Nat., I, ch. 8, p. 100,
 ed. Bas.) But, since the strike of the London builders in 1859,
 capitalists have begun to form more general opposing unions. On a very
 energetic one among the ship builders on the Clyde, see <i>Count de
 Paris</i>, Les Associations ouvrières en Angleterre, 1869, ch. 7. Examples
 on a smaller scale, Edinburg Review, LXXXIX, 327 ff. On the other hand, a
 "lock-out" on the part of capitalists is very difficult, from the fact
 that it is impossible to prevent idle workmen from being supported from
 the poor fund. Moreover, there can be no greater folly than for the
 workmen to add insult to their masters to their demand for higher wages,
 because then the limits within which the latter are willing to continue
 the business at all, are made much narrower, than they would be on a
 merely economic estimate.</p>

 Thus the "iron man," by which a single person can put from 1,500 to 3,000

 Thus in several places in 1848, and in Paris in 1789, where even the

<i>Thornton</i> mentions six instances in which strikes and strike-unions
 may permanently raise wages: a, when those engaged in an enterprise have a
 virtual monopoly in their own neighborhood; b, when the country has, for
 the industry in question, great advantage over other lands; c, when the
 demand for the product of the industry is necessary on account of an
 increasing number and increasing capacity to pay of customers; d, when the
 progress of the arts, especially of machinery, makes the industry more
 productive; e, when the rise in the rate of wages affects all branches of
 industry to the same extent, and at the same time; f, when the industry is
 carried on on so large a scale that it yields greater profit, even while
 paying a smaller percentage than other industries. (On Labour, III, ch.
 4.) It is easy to see that many of these conditions meet in the building
 industries in large cities.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_176-8"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_176-8" class="pginternal">[176-8]</a>
 Compare <i>Brentano</i> in the Preliminary Essay to <i>T. Smith's</i>
 English Guilds, ch. LXXII ff. The same author's Die Arbeitergilden der
 Gegenwart Bd., I, 1871.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_176-9"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_176-9" class="pginternal">[176-9]</a>
 The greater number of strikes begin with a small minority, generally of
 the best paid workmen, whom the others follow unwillingly but blindly.
 (Edinb. Rev., 149, 422.) The despotic power of the Unions over their
 members depends principally on the fact that their treasury serves not
 only to maintain strikes but at the same time as an insurance fund for old
 age and sickness, and that every case of disobedience of a member is
 punished by expulsion, i. e., with the loss of everything he has
 contributed. Hence the Quart. Rev., Oct., 1867, advises that these two
 purposes which are so hard, technically speaking, to reconcile with each
 other, should be required to be kept separate, especially as most of the
 unions, considered as benevolent associations, are really insolvent.
 (Edinb. Review, Oct., 1867, 421 ff.) On the other hand, both the <i>Count
 of Paris</i>, ch. 3, and <i>Thornton</i> are favorable to the admixture of
 humane and offensive objects in the trades-unions, because the former
 contribute to make the latter milder. <i>Brentano</i>, I, 153, has no
 great objection to the insolvency shown by the books of the unions
 <i>vis-a-vis</i> of their duties as insurers, since, hitherto, the
 subscription of an extraordinary sum has never failed to make up the
 deficit. A strike is detrimental in proportion as the striking workmen
 represent more of the previous preliminary operations that go to finish a
 product; as when, for instance, the 50 or 60 spinners in a factory strike,
 and in consequence, from 700 to 800 other workmen are thrown out of
 employment and forced into idleness against their will. What might not
 have been the consequence of the great union of the coal miners of Durham
 and Northumberland, the members of which numbered 40,000 men, and stopped
 work from April to the beginning of September, 1864, so that at last it
 became necessary to carry Scotch coal to Newcastle! Compare <i>Engels</i>,
 Lage der arbeitenden Klassen in England, 314 ff.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_176-10"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_176-10" class="pginternal">[176-10]</a>
 The English unions even forbid their members to exceed the established
 time of work, or the established task. Thus, for instance, a penalty of
 one shilling for carrying at any time more than eight bricks in the case
 of masons, and a similar penalty inflicted on the person's companions who
 witness the violation of the rule and do not report the guilty party.
 Equality of wages for all members; piece-wages allowed only when the
 surplus earned is divided among one's companions. Hence the complete
 discouragement of all skill or industry above the average. If an employer
 exceeds the prescribed number of apprentices; if he engages workmen not
 belonging to the union; if he introduces new machines, a strike is
 ordered. With all this the severest exclusion respectively of one class of
 tradesmen by the other. If a carpenter lays a few stones, a strike
 immediately! (Quart. Rev., October, 1867, 363, 373.) Rigid shutting out of
 the products of one district from another. (Edinburg Rev., October, 1867,
 431.) The poor hand-weavers were thus prevented going from their
 over-crowded trade into another. (<i>J. Stuart Mill</i>, Principles, II,
 ch. 14, 6.) However, many trades-unions still seem to be free from these
 degenerations, and the most influential unions the most moderate in their
 proceedings. (<i>Count de Paris</i>, ch. 8, 9; <i>Thornton</i>, III, ch.
 2.) <i>Brentano</i> expressly assured us that such degeneration of the
 unions in England is confined to the building trades-unions. (I, 68,
 188.)</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_176-11"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_176-11" class="pginternal">[176-11]</a>
 "They have no notion of contenting themselves with an equal voice in the
 settlement of labor questions; they tell us plainly that what they aspire
 to is to control the destinies of labor, ... to dictate, to be able to
 arrange the conditions of employment at their own discretion."
 (<i>Thornton</i>, III, ch. 1.) The membership of the English trades-unions
 was estimated, at the Manchester Congress, June, 1868, at 500,000 by some,
 and at 800,000 by others. <i>Brentano</i>, II, 310, speaks of 960,000.
 Since 1830, there have been frequent endeavors to effect a great
 combination, with special organizations of the different trades. During
 recent years, there have been even beginnings of an international
 organization, although in Germany, for instance, at the end of 1874, there
 were 345 trades-unions, with a membership of over 21,000. (<i>M.
 Hirsch.</i>) A formal theory of workmen's unions to culminate in popular
 representation, in <i>Dühring</i>, Arbeit und Kapital, 1866, especially,
 p. 233; while the American <i>Walker</i> accuses all such combinations,
 which used compulsion on any one, of moral high treason against republican
 institutions. (Science of Wealth, 272.)</p>

 The former view, for instance, of <i>Harriet Martineau</i>, "The tendence
 of strikes and sticks to produce low wages" (1834) is now unconditionally
 shared only by few. When <i>Sterling</i> says that the momentary success
 of a strike is followed by a two-fold reaction which restores the natural
 equilibrium, viz.: increase of the number of workmen and decrease of
 capital (Journal des Econ., 1870, 192), he overlooks not only the length
 of the transition time which would certainly be possible here, but also
 that an altered standard of life of the workmen prevents the former, and
 one of the capitalists the latter. The <i>Count of Paris</i> and
 <i>Thornton</i> do not doubt that the elevation of the condition of the
 English working classes, as proved by <i>Ludlow</i> and <i>Jones</i>, is
 to be ascribed, in part, to the effect of the trades-unions. Many of the
 unions work against the intemperance and quarrelsomeness of their members.
 The people's charter of 1835, came from the London "workingmen's
 association."</p>

<p class="center smaller">WAGES-POLICY.—STRIKES AND THE STATE.</p>
<p>Should the state tolerate the existence of strikes or strike-unions?
Legislation in the past most frequently gave a negative answer to the
question, as well from a repugnance for high wages as for the self-help of
the masses.<a id="fnanchor_177-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_177-1">[177-1]</a> But even leaving <span class="pagenum">[Pg 91]</span> the above reasons out of consideration,
every strike is a severe injury to the national resources in general,<a id="fnanchor_177-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_177-2">[177-2]</a> one which causes that part especially to
suffer from which those engaged in the various enterprises and the working
class draw their income. And, even for the latter, the damage endured is so
great that it can be compensated for only by very permanently high wages.<a id="fnanchor_177-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_177-3">[177-3]</a> How many a weak man has been misled by a long
cessation from work during a strike, which ate up his savings, into lasting
idleness and a devil-may-care kind of life. When employers, through fear of
strikes, keep all <span class="pagenum">[Pg 92]</span> large orders, etc.
secret, the workmen are not in a condition to forecast their prospects and
condition even for the near future. And in the end a dread of the frequent
return of such disturbances may cause capital to emigrate.<a id="fnanchor_177-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_177-4">[177-4]</a></p>
<p>However, where there exists a very high degree of civilization, there is
a balance of reasons in favor of the non-intervention of governments,<a id="fnanchor_177-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_177-5">[177-5]</a> but only so long as the striking workmen are
guilty of no breach of contract and of no crime. Where every one may
legally throw up his employment, there is certainly no plausible legal
objection to all of them doing so at once, and then forming new
engagements. Coalitions of purchasers of labor for the purpose of lowering
wages, which are most frequent though noiselessly formed, the police power
of the state cannot prevent. If now it were attempted to keep the working
class alone from endeavoring to correspondingly raise their wages, the
impression would become general, and be entertained with right, that the
authorities were given to measuring with different standards. Where the
working classes so sensitively feel the influence of the government on the
state of their wages, they would be only too much inclined to charge every
chance pressure made by the circumstances of the times to the account of
the state, and thus burthen it with a totally unbearable responsibility.
Since 1824, freedom of competition has prevailed in this matter on both
sides in England.<a id="fnanchor_177-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_177-6">[177-6]</a> The <span class="pagenum">[Pg 93]</span> dark side of the picture would be most

<p>Whether the trades-unions, when they shall have happily withstood the
fermentative process now going on, shall be able to fill up the void
created by the downfall of the economically active corporations of the
latter part of the middle ages, we shall discuss in our future work, Die
Nationalökonomik des Gewerbfleisses. One of the chief conditions precedent
thereto is the strict justice of the state, which should protect members of
the unions from all tyranny by their leaders, and from violations of the
legal rights of non-members.<a id="fnanchor_177-8"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_177-8">[177-8]</a>

 Thus even 34 Edw. III., c. 9. Journeymen builders were forbidden by 3
 Henry VI., c. 1, to form conspiracies to enhance the rate of wages, under
 pain of felony. Finally, 39 and 40 George III., c. 106, threatened any one
 who, by mere persuasion, should induce a workman to leave his master's
 service, etc., with 2 months in the work-house, or 3 months' imprisonment.
 In France, as late as June and September, 1791, all conspiracies to raise
 wages were prohibited under penalty, the incentive to such prohibition
 being the opposition to all <i>intérêts intermédiaries</i> between the
 <i>intérêts particulier</i>; and the <i>intérêt general</i> which is
 characteristic of the entire revolution. Compare the law of 22 Germinal,
 11. The German Empire on the 16th of August, 1731, threatened journeymen
 strikers even with death, "when accompanied by great refractoriness and
 productive of real damage." (Art. 15.)</p>

 The strike of the spinners of Preston, to compel equal wages with those of
 Bolton, lasted from October to the end of December, 1836. The spinners got
 from their treasury 5 shillings a week (previously 22½ shillings wages);
 twisters, 2 to 3 shillings; carders and weavers lived on alms. In the
 middle of December, the funds of the union were exhausted. Altogether, the
 workmen lost 400,000 thalers; the manufacturers, over 250,000; and many
 merchants failed. (<i>H. Ashworth</i>, Inquiry into the Origin and Results
 of the Cotton Spinners' Strike.) The Preston strike of 1853 cost the
 employers £165,000, the workmen, £357,000. (Edinburgh Rev., July, 1854,
 166.) The North-Stafford puddlers' strike, in 1865, cost the workmen in
 wages alone £320,000. Concerning 8 strikes that failed, mostly between
 1859 and 1861, which cost in the aggregate £1,570,000, of which £1,353,000
 were wages lost, see Statist. Journ., 1861, 503. A great mortality of the
 children of workingmen observed during strikes!</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_177-3"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_177-3" class="pginternal">[177-3]</a>
<i>Watts</i> assumes that the strikers seek to attain, on an average, an
 advance in their wages of five per cent. Now, a week is about equivalent
 to two per cent. of the year. If, therefore, a strike lasted one month,
 the increase of wages it operates must last one and three-fifths years to
 compensate the workmen for their loss. A strike that lasts 12½ months
 would require 20 years to effect the same, and this does not include
 interest on lost wages. (Statist. Journal, 1861, 501 ff.) However, it is
 possible that the striking workingmen themselves should lose more than
 they gained, but that, for the whole working class, the gain should exceed
 the loss; since those who had not participated in the strike would
 participate in the increased wages. <i>Thornton</i> is of opinion that
 employers have won in most strikes, but surrendered in the intervals
 between strikes, so that now English workmen receive certainly £5,000,000
 more in wages than they would be getting were it not for the
 trades-unions. (III, ch. 3-4.)</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_177-4"></a>

 By the Norwich strike, about the beginning of the fourth decade of this
 century, what remained of the industrial life of that city disappeared.
 (<i>Kohl</i>, Reise, II, 363 ff.) Similarly in Dublin. (Quart. Rev.,
 October, 1859, 485 ff.) In Cork, the workingmen's union, in 1827, allowed
 no strange workmen to join them, and, it is said, committed twenty murders
 with a view to that end. The builders demanded 4s. 1d. a day wages. This
 discouraged the erection of new buildings, and it frequently happened that
 they found employment only one day in two weeks. (Edinb.<a id="fnanchor_TN16"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN16">[TN 16]</a> Rev., XLVII, 212.) When workingmen struggle against
 a natural decline of the rate of wages, they, of course, add to their
 misfortune.</p>

<a href="#fnanchor_177-5" class="pginternal">[177-5]</a>
 The grounds on which <i>Brentano</i>, following <i>Ludlow</i> and
 <i>Harrison</i>, justifies the intervention of the state, have a very
 dangerous bearing, inasmuch as they do not suppose, as a condition
 precedent, a perfectly wise and impartial governmental authority.</p>

 5 George IV., c. 95: "provided no violence is used." Further, 6 George
 IV., c. 129, and 122 Vict., c. 34. The law of 1871 declares the
 trades-unions lawful, allows them the right of registration, and thus
 empowers them to hold property. In France, the law of May 25, 1864, alters
 articles 414 to 416 of the <i>Code pénal</i> to the effect that only such
 strikes shall be punished as happen <i>à l'aide de violences, voies de
 fait, manœuvres frauduleuses</i>; also coalitions against the <i>libre
 exercise du travail à l'aide d'amendes, défenses, proscriptions,
 interdictions</i>. But these amendments were rendered rather inoperative
 by the fact that meetings of more than 20 persons could be held only by
 permission of the police.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_177-7"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_177-7" class="pginternal">[177-7]</a>
 As, for instance, the coal workers in the north of England required a half
 year's service. So long as the trades-unions consider themselves, by way
 of preference, as instruments of war, it is conceivable how they oppose
 all binding contracts for labor. So now among the German journeymen
 book-printers, and so, also, for the most part, in England.
 (<i>Brentano</i>, II, 108.) In quieter times, when the trades-unions shall
 have become peace institutions, this will be otherwise. We cannot even
 enjoy the bright side of the freedom of birds without enduring its dark
 side! In Switzerland, breaches of contract by railroad officers are
 guarded against by their giving security beforehand; in manufactures, by
 the holding back of from 3 to 14 days' wages. (<i>Böhmert</i>,
 Arbeiterverhältnisse, II, 91, 388 ff.)</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_177-8"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_177-8" class="pginternal">[177-8]</a>
 In Switzerland, the trades-unions have shown themselves very powerful
 against the employers of tradesmen, but rather powerless against
 manufacturing employers, and thus materially increased the already
 existing inferiority of the former. (<i>Böhmert</i>, II, 401.) They may,
 however, by further successful development, constitute the basis of a new
 smaller middle class, similar to the tradesmen's<a id="fnanchor_TN17"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN17">[TN
 17]</a> guilds at the end of the middle ages; and indeed by a new
 exclusiveness, in a downward direction. This would be a bulwark against
 the destructive inroads of socialism similar to that which the freed
 peasantry in France were and still are. While this is also
 <i>Brentano's</i> view, <i>R. Meyer</i>, Emancipationskampf des vierten
 Standes, 1874, I, 254 ff., calls the trades-unions a practical preparation
 for socialism to which the English "morally went over" in 1869 (I, 751);
 which indeed loses much of the appearance of truth from the fact that
 <i>Marx</i> (<i>Brentano</i>, Arbeitergilden, II, 332) and the disciples
 of <i>Lassalle</i> (<i>Meyer</i>, I, 312) hold the trades-unions in
 contempt. <i>John Stuart Mill</i> approves of all trades-unions that seek
 to effect the better remuneration of labor, and opposes all which would
 bring the wages paid for good work and bad work to the same level.
 (Principles, II, ch. 14, 6; V, ch. 10, 5.) Compare <i>Tooke</i>, History
 of Prices, VI, 176. Reports of the Commissioners appointed to inquire into
 the Organization and Rules of Trades-Unions, 1857.</p>
<p class="p2 center"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 94]</span><a id="S178"></a>SECTION CLXXVIII.</p>
<p class="center smaller">WAGES-POLICY.—MINIMUM OF WAGES.</p>
<p>The demand<a id="fnanchor_178-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_178-1">[178-1]</a> so frequently heard
recently, that the state should guaranty an "equitable" minimum of wages,
could be granted where the natural rate of wages has fallen below that
minimum, only on condition that some of the working class in the
distribution of the wages capital (no longer sufficient in all the less
profitable branches of business) should go away entirely empty handed.
Hence, as a rule, in addition to that wages-guaranty, the guaranty of the
right to labor is also required. But as useful labor always finds
purchasers (the word "useful" being here employed in the sense of the
entire economy of a people, and understood in the light of the proper
gradation of wants and the means of satisfying them), such a right to labor
means no more and no less than that the state should force labor which no
one can use, upon others.<a id="fnanchor_178-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_178-2">[178-2]</a> Something <span class="pagenum">[Pg 95]</span>
similar is true of Louis Blanc's proposition that the rate of wages of the
workmen should be determined and regulated by their own votes and among
themselves.<a id="fnanchor_178-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_178-3">[178-3]</a></p>
<p>All such measures are injurious in proportion as they, by extending aid
and the amount of the minimum, go beyond the limits of benevolence, and
approach those of a community of goods. (§ 81 ff.) However, if they would
be lasting and not pull workmen rapidly down to the very depths of
universal and irremediable misery, these measures should be accompanied by
the bestowal of power on the guarantor to hold the further increase of the
human family within bounds.<a id="fnanchor_178-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_178-4">[178-4]</a>
</p>
<p>The condition of workmen can be continued good or materially improved
only on condition that their numbers increase less rapidly than the capital
destined for wages. The latter increases usually and most surely by
savings. But only the middle classes are really saving. In England, for
instance, the national capital increases every year by at least
£50,000,000, while the working classes spend at least £60,000,000 in
tobacco and spirituous liquors, <i>i. e.</i>, in numberless instances, only
for a momentary injurious enjoyment by the adult males of the class, one in
which their families have almost no share. According to this, every
compulsory rise in wages would be a taking away from the saving class and a
giving to a class that <span class="pagenum">[Pg 96]</span> effect no
savings. Is not this to act after the manner of the savages who cut down a
fruit tree in order more conveniently to relish its fruit?<a id="fnanchor_178-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_178-5">[178-5]</a></p>
<p>Benjamin Franklin calls out to workmen and says: If any one tells you
that you can become rich in any other way than through industry and
frugality, do not listen to him; he is a poisoner! And, in fact, only those
changes permanently improve the condition of the working classes which are
useful to the whole people: enhanced productiveness of every branch of
business in the country, increased capital, the growth (also relative) of
the industrial middle classes, the greater education, strength of
character, skill and fidelity in labor of workmen themselves. Much
especially depends upon their foresight and self-control as regards
bringing children into the world. Without this latter virtue even the
favorable circumstances would be soon trifled away.<a id="fnanchor_178-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_178-6">[178-6]

 at pleasure to serve its purposes; that, in fact, the state can give
 without having first taken what it gave. (Mélanges d'Economie politique,

 Compare <i>Morrison</i>, loc. cit. Quarterly Rev., Jan. 1872, 260. The
 English savings in the savings banks, between 1839 and 1846, increased
 yearly in amount only £1,408,630, and scarcely half of this came from
 wages-workmen in the narrower sense of the term. What the latter
 contribute to the fund for the old and sick is not really productive
 capital but only individually deferred consumption. Let us suppose that a
 man had an income of $3,000 a year, of which he laid out yearly $2,000
 ($1,000 for wages, $1,000 for rent and interest<a id="fnanchor_TN18"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN18">[TN

 either through philanthropy or in furtherance of socialism, to double the
 wages he paid, the result would not be detrimental to the economic
 interests of the whole country only on the supposition that working
 classes who received the increased wages should either save what he is no
 longer able to save, or that by inventions or greater personal skill,

<p>Interest on capital,<a id="fnanchor_179-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_179-1">[179-1]</a> or the price paid for the use of capital, should not
be confounded with the price of money (§ 42); although in common life
people so frequently complain of want of money where there is only a want
of capital, and sometimes even when there is a superabundance of money.<a id="fnanchor_179-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_179-2">[179-2]</a> This error is connected with the fact, that
for the sake of convenience, loans of capital are so often effected in the
form of <span class="pagenum">[Pg 98]</span> money and that they are always
at least estimated in money; but neither of these things is essential.</p>
<p>In reality, however, we as seldom meet with interest<a id="fnanchor_179-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_179-3">[179-3]</a> pure and simple, as we do with rent pure and
simple. A person who works with his own capital can, at best, by a
comparison with others, determine where, in the returns of his business,
wages stop and interest begins.<a id="fnanchor_179-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_179-4">[179-4]</a> And even in the loaning of capital, it depends
largely on supply and demand, whether the creditor shall suffer a deduction
in consequence of the absence of care and labor attending his gain, and
whether the debtor, in order to get some capital at all, shall sacrifice a
part of the wages of his labor.<a id="fnanchor_179-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_179-5">[179-5]</a> When Adam Smith assumes it to be the rule that the
"profit of stock" is about twice as great as the "interest of money,"<a id="fnanchor_179-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_179-6">[179-6]</a> it is evident that a considerable amount of
what is properly wages or profit of <span class="pagenum">[Pg 99]</span>
the employer (<i>Uhternekmer</i> = undertaker) is included in the
former.</p>
<p>Many businesses have the reputation of paying a very large interest on
the capital employed in them, when in reality they only pay the undertaker
of them wages unusually high as compared with the amount of capital
employed in them. Apothecaries, for instance, are called in some places
"ninety-niners," because it is said that they earn 99 per cent. To discover
the error, it would be sufficient to inquire the rate of interest on the
capital borrowed by the apothecary on hypothecation, for instance, to
enlarge his industry. But on the other hand, such a man who has more than
any other manufacturer to do with the most delicate materials and with them
in greater variety, requires proportionately greater caution and knowledge.
Besides, as the guardian of the health and life of so many, and even as the
comptroller of physicians, he should be a man who inspired universal and
unqualified confidence.<a id="fnanchor_179-7"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_179-7">[179-7]</a> By the rate of interest

 In the case of fixed capital, we generally speak of rent; in the case of
 circulating capital, of interest. If interest be conceived as a fractional
 part of the capital itself, the relation between the two is called "the
 rate of interest," most generally expressed as a percentage, and for one
 year.</p>

 Thus, for instance, a so-called beginner who is conscious of possessing
 great working capacity, but who possesses for the time being little
 credit. <i>Tooke</i>, Considerations on the State of the Currency, 1826,
 distinguishes three kinds of capitalists: a, those who are averse to
 running any risk whatever or incurring any trouble, or are not able to
 incur any risk or trouble, for whom every great increase of the sinking
 fund lowers the rate of interest, and every war loan raises it; b, those
 who will run no risk, but who are not averse to the trouble of looking
 after their investments and of endeavoring to obtain a higher rate of
 interest; c, such as, to obtain a higher rate of interest, unhesitatingly
 risk something. Borrowers he divides thus: a, those who employ the
 borrowed capital and their own in such a way as to enable them to meet
 their obligations and besides to earn a reasonable profit; b, those who
 need others' capital to make up for the momentary failure of the
 productiveness of their own; lastly c, unproductive consumers.</p>

<i>Adam Smith</i>, I, ch. 10, 1: where the reasons why a shop-keeper in a
 small town apparently gets a larger interest than one in a large city, and
 yet gets rich less frequently, are developed. The high profit made from
 industrial secrets, Adam Smith very correctly considers wages (I, ch. 7).
 Why not also that made by inn-keepers? (I, ch. 10, 1.) When the returns of
 a business differ according to circumstances which depend on the person of
 the conductor of the business himself, and may by him be transferred into
 another business, etc.; when the competition in it is determined by
 personal agreeableness or disagreeableness, it is evident that the larger
 returns are to be ascribed rather to the highness of wages than of the
 rate of interest. The profit also which a second-hand hirer makes is
 wages. (<i>Riedel</i>, Nat. Oek., 376.)</p>

<p class="center smaller">RATE OF INTEREST IN GENERAL.—ITS LEVEL.</p>
<p>Within the limits of the same national-economic territory, the different
employments of capital tend uniformly to pay the <span class="pagenum">[Pg
100]</span> same rate of interest.<a id="fnanchor_180-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_180-1">[180-1]</a> If one branch of business were much more profitable
than another, it would be to the interest of the owners of capital to allow
it to flow into the former and out of the latter, until a level was
reached.<a id="fnanchor_180-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_180-2">[180-2]</a></p>
<p>The most noticeable exception to this rule is only an apparent one. The
revenue (<i>Nutzung</i>) derived from the use of capital must not be
confounded with its partial restoration.<a id="fnanchor_180-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_180-3">[180-3]</a> Thus, for instance, the rent of a house, if the
entire capital is not to be sooner or later consumed entirely, must
embrace, besides a payment for the use of the house, a sum sufficient to
defray the expenses of repairing it, and even to effect a gradual
accumulation of capital for the purpose of rebuilding. The risk attending
the investment of capital plays a very large part and must be taken into
special consideration. If the risk in a business be so great that ten who
engage in it succeed and ten fail, the returns of the former, which are
more than double those usual in the country, in reality pay, when the ten
who failed are taken into the account, only the rate of interest customary
in the country. The risk may depend on the uncertainty of the person to
whom the capital is confided;<a id="fnanchor_180-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_180-4">[180-4]</a> on the uncertainty of the branch of business in
which it is intended to employ it,<a id="fnanchor_180-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_180-5">[180-5]</a> or on the uncertainty of the commercial <span class="pagenum">[Pg 101]</span> situation in general; but especially may it
depend on the uncertainty of the laws.<a id="fnanchor_180-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_180-6">[180-6]</a> The temporary lying idle of capital, for instance,
in dwelling houses at bathing places during the winter season, increases
the rate of interest much more than it does the rate of wages in the
corresponding case of the lying idle of labor; for the reason that there is
something pleasurable in the repose of the latter. (<i>Senior.</i>) On the
whole, the vanity of mankind has an effect upon the rate of interest
similar to that which it has on the rate of wages. (See § 168.) It causes
the small chances of loss to be estimated below their real value, and the
extraordinary chances of gain above it.<a id="fnanchor_180-7"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_180-7">[180-7]</a></p>

 Thus even in <i>Anderson's</i> time, it was necessary that the profit of
 one good year in the whale fishery should compensate for the damage caused
 by six bad ones. (Origin of Commerce, III, 184.) Slave-traders made their
 calculations to lose from three to four out of five expeditions.
 (Athenæum, May 6, 1848) Similarly in smuggling and contraband. High rate
 of interest in gross adventure trade and bottomry contracts, frequently 30
 and even 50 per cent.; in ancient Athens, for a simple voyage to the Black
 Sea, 36 per cent., while the rate of interest customary in the country was
 only from 12 to 18 per cent.; the interest paid by rented houses only
 8-1/7, and by land leases only 8 per cent. (<i>Bockh</i>, Staatshaushalt
 der Athener, I, 175 ff.; <i>Isaeus de Hagn.</i>, Hered., 293) In Rome,
 before Justinian's time, maritime interest was unlimited.
 (<i>Hudtwalker</i>, De Foenore nautico Romano, 1810.) And so in the
 manufacture of powder, the frequent explosion of the mills has to be taken
 into account: in France and Austria, 16 per cent. per annum.
 (<i>Hermann</i>, Principien, 119.) Here belong those new enterprises
 which, when they succeed, pay a high profit. <i>Thaer</i>, in reference to

 at least 6, and the working capital 12 per cent. (Ration.

 Thus <i>Friedr. Perthes</i>, in <i>Politz</i>, Jarhbüchern, Jan., 1829,
 42, thinks that the publication of scientific books in Germany, since
 1800, caused, on the whole, a loss of capital. In the Canadian lumber
 trade, also, speculators, in the aggregate, lost more than was gained. Yet
 the business goes on because of its lottery character. (<i>John Stuart
 Mill</i>, II, ch. 15, 4.) In lotteries, it is certain that the aggregate
 of players lose. So too in speculation in English stocks, on account of
 the costs to be paid the state. In the case of frightful losses, which may
 afford food for the imagination, the reverse is found. Thus, for instance,
 in England, fire insurance, stamp duties included, was paid for at a rate
 five times as high as mathematical calculation showed it to be worth.
 (<i>Senior</i>, Outlines, 212 ff.) Much here depends naturally on national
 character, which, in England for instance, or in the United States, is
 much more adventurous than in many quiet regions of continental
 Europe.</p>

<p class="center smaller">RULE OF INTEREST IN GENERAL.—CAUSES OF
DIFFERENT RATES.</p>
<p>The real exceptions to the above rules are caused by a prevention of the
leveling influx and outflow of capital. Among nations in a low stage of
civilization, there is wont to be a multitude of legal impediments in this
respect. The existence of a difference of classes, of privileged
corporations, etc., not only restrains the transition of workmen, but also
of capital from one branch of industry to another. But even the mere
routine of capitalists, that blind distrust of everything new so frequently
characteristic of easily contented men, may produce the same result.<a id="fnanchor_181-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_181-1">[181-1]</a> In the higher stages of civilization, patents
for inventions and bank privileges, are causes of a lastingly higher rate
of interest than is usual in the country.<a id="fnanchor_181-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_181-2">[181-2]</a> Finally, since in many enterprises only a large
amount of capital can be used at all, or at least with most advantage, the
aggregation of which from many small sources is ordinarily much more
difficult than the division of a large one into small fractional parts; the
rate of interest for very small amounts of capital, and especially in the
higher stages of civilization, is usually lower than that of large amounts
of capital. We need only mention interest paid by savings-bank
investments.<a id="fnanchor_181-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_181-3">[181-3]</a></p>
<p>If circulating capital has been changed into fixed capital, its yield
will depend upon the price of the particular goods in the production of
which it has been made to serve. Compared <span class="pagenum">[Pg
103]</span> with the cost of restoration of fixed capital, this yield may,
in a favorable case, constitute an extraordinarily high rate of interest,
in an unfavorable a very low one; and the former of these two extremes has
a greater chance of being realized, in proportion as it is difficult to
multiply fixed capital of the same kind; the latter, the more exclusively
it can be employed in only one kind of production, and the longer time it
takes to be used up by wear.<a id="fnanchor_181-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_181-4">[181-4]</a> When fixed and circulating capital coöperate in
production, the latter, because it can be more easily withdrawn, but also
more easily replaced, first takes out its own profit, that is the profit
usual in the country and leaves all the rest to the former. When fixed
capital is sold, practically no attention is paid to what it originally
cost. The purchaser pays only for the prospective revenue it will yield,
which he capitalizes at the rate of interest usual in the country. The
seller henceforth looks <span class="pagenum">[Pg 104]</span> upon his gain
as an accretion to capital, his loss as a diminution of capital, and no
longer as high or low interest.<a id="fnanchor_181-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_181-5">[181-5]</a> That accretion might be considered the wages, paid

 In other words, the more fixed they are. Thus, for instance, dwelling
 houses in declining cities, canals, etc. which have been supplanted by
 better commercial routes; or again, the shafts and stulms of a mine which
 has been abandoned. When Versailles ceased to be a royal residence, the
 value of inhabited houses sank to one-fourth of what it had been.
 (<i>Zinkeisen</i> in <i>Raumer's</i> histor. Taschenbuch, 1837, 426.) A
 rate of interest greater than that usual in a country is seldom found
 where freedom of competition prevails, since it is necessary there to
 distinguish between rent and interest on capital. When in an open city,
 the capital employed in the construction of dwelling houses <i>detractis
 detrahendis</i> pays 8 per cent., while the rate of interest customary in
 the country is only 4 per cent., the supply of houses will grow
 continually greater. Only the difficulties in the way of transferring
 capital from one business to another could here retard the leveling
 process, which where the political prospect for instance was bad, might
 last a long time—one of the principal reasons why, in 1848, the rent
 of houses declined much less than their purchase prices. The conjuncture
 was not serious enough to prevent the increase of population; but it
 entirely stopped the building of new houses. On the other hand, a bridge
 or railroad company may maintain a high rate of profit because competition
 cannot exist in the face of the great expense such enterprises require;
 but especially because the party who has here the advantage of priority
 may lower the price of transportation to such a point as to entirely
 discourage his rival. Compare <i>Hermann</i>, Staatsw. Untersuchungen, 145

 Thus, for instance, Leipzig-Dresden railroad stock cost originally 100
 thalers per share, and was taken at that rate. The yearly dividends
 amounted in 1856 to 13 thalers; that is, 13 per cent. for the original
 stockholders. But a person who on the 30th September, 1856, paid 285
 thalers for a share, received but an interest of 4½ per cent. on his
 capital. It is characteristic, how <i>Serra</i>, Sulle Cause, etc., 1613,

<p class="center smaller">VARIATIONS OF THE RATE OF DISCOUNT.</p>
<p>The fact that in commerce, etc., the rate of interest on capital loaned
for short periods of time (discount) is subject to great fluctuations,
while the mortgage rate of interest, for instance, remains the same
throughout, depends on similar causes.<a id="fnanchor_182-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_182-1">[182-1]</a> Yet there are contingencies in trade which, when
taken immediate advantage of, promise enormous profits, but <span class="pagenum">[Pg 105]</span> which may disappear within a month; risks
of the most dangerous kind which can be conjured only by the immediate aid
of capital. These are both sufficient grounds of a high rate of interest.
Again, there are times of the profoundest calm in the commercial world,
during which capitalists are perfectly willing to make loans at a low rate
of interest, provided they are sure to be able to get back their capital
with the first favorable breeze that blows. Agriculture is too immovable to
come opportunely to the assistance of capitalists, here as a receiver and
there as a loaner of capital. As the cycle of its operations is gone
through usually only in a series of years, sudden influxes or outflows of
capital would cause it the greatest injury.<a id="fnanchor_182-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_182-2">[182-2]</a></p>

<i>Nebenius</i>, Oeff. Credit, I, 74 ff. Thus, Hamburg discount towards
 the end of the last century fluctuated between 2½ and 12 per cent., while
 the capital invested in agriculture brought an interest almost invariably
 of 4 per cent. (<i>Büsch</i>, Geldumlauf, VI, 4, 19.) At the same time, in
 Pennsylvania, the usual rate of interest was 6 per cent. per annum, and
 the rate of discount not unfrequently from 2 to 3 per cent. a month.
 (<i>Ebeling</i> Geschichte und Erdbeschreib. von Amerika, IV, 442.) During
 the crisis of 1837, it happened that ¼ per cent. a day was paid.
 (<i>Rau</i>, Archiv. N. F. IV, 382.) In the Prussian ports, during the
 crisis of 1810, it is said that in July the rate of discount was 2½ per
 cent. a month. (<i>Tooke</i>, Thoughts and Details, I, 111.) In Hamburg
 and Frankfort the rate of discount rose in the spring of 1848, but
 declined in June to 2; until December it was 1¼, until the summer of 1849,
 ¾ per cent. (Tüb. Zeitschr., 1856, 95.) Rate of discount in France, about
 1798, at least 2 per cent. a month. (<i>Büsch</i>, loc. cit., IV, 52.)
 Half a year previous, capital employed in the purchase of land paid an

<p class="center smaller">EFFECT OF INCREASED DEMAND FOR LOANS.</p>
<p>The price paid for the use of capital naturally depends on the relation
between the supply and demand, and especially of circulating capital. The
increase of the supply need no more unconditionally lower the rate of
interest than the price of any other commodity. If 50 hunters kill 1,000
deer yearly, and give 100 deer per annum as interest to the capitalists who
provided them with ammunition and rifles, a second capitalist with an equal
number of rifles and an equal amount of ammunition may appear on the scene.
If now 2,000 deer a year are killed, the rate of profit of the capitalists
will probably remain the same. But if the woods are not rich enough in game
for this, or the hunters not numerous enough, too indolent, or too easily
satisfied, the rate of interest falls.<a id="fnanchor_183-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_183-1">[183-1]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 106]</span>The difficulties in the way of the
desired increase of capital are here of great importance. The smaller the
surplus over and above their absolutely necessary wants, which the people
produce, the less their tendency to make savings, the less the inclination
to capitalization; and the less the security afforded by the law is, the
higher must the rate of interest be to induce people to face these
difficulties. We may very well transfer the idea of cost of production to
this condition.<a id="fnanchor_183-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_183-2">[183-2]</a></p>
<p>The demand for capital depends, on the one hand, on the number and the
solvability of borrowers, especially of non-capitalists like landowners and
workmen; and, on the other hand, on the value in use of the capital itself.
Hence the growth of population is, other circumstances being the same, a
means to raise the rate of interest; because it infallibly increases the
competition of borrowers of capital, even if the increased rate must take
place at the expense of wages. The solvability or paying capacity of the
land-owning class as contrasted with the capitalists can, in the last
analysis, depend only on the extent and fertility of their lands and on the
quality of their agricultural husbandry; the solvability or paying capacity
of the working class, only on their skill and industry. Where these have
grown, an increase of the rate of interest may be found in connection with
an absolute growth of the rate of wages and of rent, because the aggregate
income of the nation has become greater.</p>
<p>The value in use of capital, which is more homogeneous in proportion as
it has the character of circulating capital (<i>res fungibiles</i>) is, in
most instances, synonymous with the skill of the working class, and the
richness of the natural forces connected with it. The deciding element,
therefore, is the yield of the least productive investment of capital which
must be made to employ all the capital seeking employment. This least
productive employment of capital must <span class="pagenum">[Pg 107]</span>
determine the rate of interest customary in a country precisely as cost of
production on the most unfavorable land determines the price of corn (§§
110, 150), and as the result of the work of the laborer last employed does
the rate of wages. (§ 165.)</p>
<p>What portion of the total national income, after deduction is made of
rent, shall go to the capitalists and what portion to the working class,
will depend mainly on whether the capitalists compete more greedily for
labor or the laboring classes for capital.<a id="fnanchor_183-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_183-3">[183-3]</a> If, for instance, capital should increase more
rapidly than population, there must be a relative increase in wages, and

of that peculiar <span class="pagenum">[Pg 108]</span> kind of higher wages
which we shall (§ 145, ff.) designate as the "undertaker's profit." The
smaller the number of persons engaged in enterprises is, in comparison with
the number of retired persons who live on their rents, incomes, etc., the
smaller is the portion of the so-called net profit of enterprise the latter

 Compare <i>Hermann</i>, Staatsw. Unters., 240 ff. Very much depends on
 whether the new increased consumption (of workmen when wages are rising,
 of capitalists when wages are declining) is of goods which are mainly the
 product of large capital, large factories, etc., or chiefly of common
 labor, (<i>von Mangoldt</i>, Grundriss, 155 seq.) When <i>Adam Smith</i>
 suggests that the relation between wages and the profit of capital is
 determined by this: whether there is a market demand for more work or more
 commodities, for more "work to be done" or "work done" (I, ch. 7), he is,
 spite of appearances, very unsatisfactory. <i>Malthus</i> distinguishes a
 restrictive principle of the rate of interest, viz.: the return made to
 the least productive agricultural capital, and a regulative one, viz.: the
 reciprocal relation between demand and supply of capital and labor.
 (Principles, ch. 5, sec. 4.) <i>Ricardo</i>, ch. 6, makes the profit of
 capital at all times and in every country depend on the quantity of labor
 which it is necessary to expend on the land which pays no rent, in order
 to satisfy the wants of workmen—a very correct theory.</p>
<p class="footnote">Only <i>Ricardo</i> himself (ch. 21) and his school
 postulate altogether too unconditionally that their wants would always
 coincide with the minimum of maintenance or support. Thus, for instance,
 <i>J. S. Mill</i>, Principles, IV, ch. 3, 4. However, <i>Mill</i> instead
 of <i>Ricardo's</i> "wages" employs the better expression, "cost of
 labor." <i>Senior</i> teaches that the distribution of the aggregate
 result between laborers and capitalists depends on the anterior course of
 both classes: on the value of the capital previously employed by
 capitalists to produce the means of satisfying working men's wants, and on
 the number of workmen which the previous laboring population have brought
 into existence. (Outlines, 188 ff.) Concerning <i>von Thünen's</i> vain
 attempt at a general formula, see <i>supra</i>, § 173. <i>Fourier's</i>
 idea that 5/12<a id="fnanchor_TN19"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN19">[TN 19]</a> of the product should be
 distributed among labor, 3/12 among talent, and 4/12 among capital, is
 entirely baseless. (N. Monde, 309 ff.) <i>Considérant</i>, Destinée
 sociale, 192 ff. As early a writer as <i>H. Boden</i>, Fürstliche
 Machtkunst, 1700 and 1740, 42, came strikingly near the truth. According
 to him, a low rate of interest is produced by four circumstances: surplus
 capital, a dearth of landed estates, a want of credit and exact justice,
 and lastly, the heavy taxation of capital.</p>

 Thus, in the last century, Spanish capitalists loaned capital readily to
 sure commercial companies, at from 2 to 3 per cent. per annum.
 (<i>Bourgoing,</i> Tableau de l'Espagne, I, 248.) The contemporary low
 rates of interest in Hannover, <i>Büsch</i>, Geldumlauf, VI, 4, 12,
 endeavors to explain by the absence of opportunities for investment, as no
 one dared to loan to any extent on fiefs or on the land of the peasantry,
 and because there was no law governing bills of exchange, etc.</p>

<p>Among barbarous nations, the loaning of capital is wont to happen so

yet occur to any one to stipulate for a regular compensation therefor.<a id="fnanchor_184-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_184-1">[184-1]</a> But, however, when they pass from this state

capital, a <span class="pagenum">[Pg 110]</span> great part remains idle,
because the faculty and the institutions necessary to concentrate it and
permit it to flow are wanting. (§ 43.) The unskillfulness of labor is more
than overcome by the excess of fertile and naturally productive land, of
rich sites still unoccupied, the cream of which, as it were, needs only to
be culled. Population is indeed sparse, but the usually prevailing absence
of freedom of the lower classes prevents wages claiming the full benefit of

 According to the Lex Visig., V, 5, § 8, the maximum rate of interest
 allowed on loans of money was 12½ per cent., and on other <i>res
 fungibiles</i>, 50 per cent. From the 12th to the 14th century, the
 Lombards and the Jews in France and England took generally (?) 20 per
 cent. a year. (<i>Anderson</i>, Origin of Commerce, <i>a.</i>, 1300.)
 Philip V. of France, in 1311, fixed the rate of interest at the fairs in
 Champagne at 15 per cent. (a species of discount) at most, and at a
 maximum everywhere of 20 per cent. (Ordonnances de la France, I, 484, 494,
 508.) The legal rate of interest in Verona, in 1288, was fixed at a
 maximum of 12½ per cent.; in Modena, 1270, at 20 per cent.
 (<i>Muratori</i>, Antiquitt. Ital., I, 894); in Bresica, 1268, at 10 per
 cent. (<i>v. Raumer</i>, Geschichte der Hohenstaufen, V, 395 ff.)
 Frederick II. wished to reduce it to 10 per cent. for Naples, but failed.
 (<i>Bianchini</i>, Storia delle Finanze di Nap., I, 299.) The tables of
 <i>Cibrario</i>, Economia polit. del medio Evo., III, 380, for 1306-1399,
 show for upper Italy interest to have been at 20, 15, 14, 10, and also 5½
 per cent. About 1430 the Florentines, in order to moderate the enormously
 high rate of interest, called Jews to their city, and the latter promised
 not to charge over 20 per cent. (<i>Cibrario</i>, III, 318.) In the Rhine
 country, the Kowerzens, during the 14th century, took from 60 to 70 per
 cent., for which they had, however, to pay a heavy tax to the archbishop.
 (<i>Bodmann</i>, Rh. Alterthümer, 716.) Of Jewish maximum rates of
 interest, in the 14th and 15th centuries, see <i>Stobbe</i>, Juden in
 Deutschland während des M. Alters, 103, 110, 234 seq.; <i>Hegel</i>,
 Strassb. Chr., II, 977, 984.</p>
<p class="footnote">The rate of interest usual in these countries must not
 however be calculated from the data furnished by these usurious rates and
 fixed rates of interest, simply. In Germany, the rate of interest promised
 by princes in the 13th and 14th centuries was usually 10 per cent. The
 Frankfort municipal loans made by Jews in the 14th century bore interest
 at the rate of 9, 11-2/3, 13, 18, 26, and even 45 per cent.
 (<i>Kriegk</i>, F.'s Bürgerzwiste, 343, 539.) The rate of interest in the
 purchase of annuities continually declined between 1300 and 1500,
 especially in the time of the emancipation of manual laborers. Old Base
 documents give, between 1284 and 1580, as the highest rate, 11-3/9, and as
 the least, 5 per cent. The latter became more and more usual later,
 especially in the sale of house-rents (<i>Hauszins</i>), so that in 1841
 all annuities (<i>Renten</i>) might be canceled by a payment of their
 amounts multiplied by 20. Until the beginning of the 15th century, in the
 city, the rule was 6 to 7 per cent.; outside of it, 8 to 10 per cent.
 (<i>Arnold</i>, Geschichte des Eigenthums in den deutschen Städten, 222
 seq., 227 seq.) According to the Bremen Jahrb. of 1784, 164 seq., the rate
 of interest in the case of <i>Handfesten,</i> in 1295, = 10 per cent.,
 gradually sank: in the 15th century it was never over 6-2/3; after 1450,
 generally 5; in 1511 only 4 per cent. In 1441 ff., in Augsburg, people
 were satisfied with a business profit of 7-2/3 per cent., while the usual
 rate of interest paid by house-rent, etc. was 5 per cent. (<i>Hegel</i>,
 Augsb. Chr., II, 134 seq., 157.) Handsome tables in the rate of interest
 in the purchase of annuities for all Germany, from 1215 to 1620, give as
 the rule, 7 to 10, scarcely ever over 15 per cent., in <i>M. Neumann</i>,
 Geschichte des Wuchers, 266 ff. For the upper Rhine, compare <i>Mone's</i>
 Zeitschr., 26 ff. Among the Fathers of the councils of Constance and Basil
 5 per cent. was considered equitable. Compare <i>F. Hammerlin</i>,
 1389-1457, De Emtione et Venditione unius pro viginti. Russian interest at
 40 per cent., according to the laws of Jaroslaw (ob. 1054 after Christ).

 The high rate of interest in many countries at present may be thus
 accounted for. In the United States, during the last century, less than 8
 per cent. was seldom paid. (<i>Ebeling</i>, III, 152.) According to <i>M.
 Chevalier</i>, Lettres sur l'Amérique du Nord, 1836, I, 59, the rate of
 interest in Pennsylvania was 6, in New York, 7, in most of the slave
 states, 8-9; in Louisiana, 10 per cent. In South Australia (1850) it was,
 with full security, 15-20 per cent. (<i>Reimer</i>, Südaustralien, 39.) In
 the West Indies, about the end of the last century, a strong negro might
 produce a revenue equal to one-fourth of his capital value. (<i>B.
 Edwards</i>, History of the British West Indies, II, 129.) In Brazil, the
 lowest rate of interest was at 9 per cent., and 12-18 per cent. was
 nothing unusual. (<i>Wappäus</i>, M. and S. Amerika, 1871, 1413.) In Cuba,
 for the government 10, for private parties, 12 to 16 per cent.
 (<i>Humboldt</i>, Cuba, I, 231.) In Potosi, in 1826, Temple got 30 per
 cent. interest on chattel mortgage, and from 2 to 4 per cent. a month was
 offered, while the rate of interest in Buenos Ayres amounted to 15 per
 cent. per annum. (<i>Temple</i>, Travels, II, 217.) In Russia,
 <i>Storch</i>, Handbuch,<a id="fnanchor_TN20"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN20">[TN 20]</a> I, 262, speaks of
 8-10 per cent. According to <i>v. Haxthausen</i>, it was, in the interior,
 never less than from 8 to 12 per cent. per annum; at Kiew and Odessa, 1¼,
 1½ and 2 per cent. per month. (Studien, I, 58, 467; II, 495.) In
 <i>Greece</i>, the rate of interest on first mortgages is at least 10, on
 a second, 15-18 per cent. (Ausland, 1843, No. 82.)</p>

<p class="center smaller">HISTORY OF THE RATE OF INTEREST.—INFLUENCE
OF AN ADVANCE IN CIVILIZATION.</p>
<p>With an advance in civilization, the rate of interest is wont to
decline.<a id="fnanchor_185-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_185-1">[185-1]</a> <a id="fnanchor_185-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_185-2">[185-2]</a> One of the chief causes of this phenomenon is
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 112]</span> the necessity, as population and
consumption increase, to employ capital in the fertilization of less
productive land, and in less profitable investments.<a id="fnanchor_185-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_185-3">[185-3]</a> An increase in the stock of money does not
necessarily depreciate the rate of interest. If this increase comes in
connection with a corresponding depreciation of the individual pieces of
metal, it cannot be said that the nation has thereby become richer in
capital. All that would be required in such case is only a greater number
of pounds of gold or silver, or more paper bills to represent the same
capital.<a id="fnanchor_185-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_185-4">[185-4]</a> Only during the
transition-period, during which the depreciation of money is still
incomplete, is the rate of interest wont to be lowered; and all the more,
since loaned capital is generally offered and sought after in the form of
money.<a id="fnanchor_185-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_185-5">[185-5]</a> <a id="fnanchor_185-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_185-6">[185-6]</a></p> <p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 113]</span></p>
<p>The decline of the rate of interest generally shows itself earliest in
the large cities, which are everywhere the national organ, in which the
good and bad symptoms of later civilization may be soonest observed.<a id="fnanchor_185-7"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_185-7">[185-7]</a></p>
<p>Moreover, the condition of capitalists is not necessarily made worse by
a decline of the rate of interest. It is possible that, for a long time,
the increase of capital should continue more rapid than the decrease of
interest for each individual. (If, indeed, the aggregate interest of
capital should become absolutely smaller, there is always a pleasant remedy
available, viz.: to consume a part of the capital!) But, however, a decline
of the rate of interest is nearly always followed by increased activity on
the part of capitalists; and they come to <span class="pagenum">[Pg
114]</span> the resolve to retire later to enjoy the results of their
previous labors. In Holland, after the time of Louis XIV., no branch of
business was wont to pay more than from two to three per cent. In the case
of the purchase of land, no one calculated on more than two per cent. Hence
it was scarcely possible for small capitalists there to live on their
interest; and the good sense of the people so well adapted itself to this
state of things that to live in leisure on one's rents was considered a not
entirely honorable mode of existence.<a id="fnanchor_185-8"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_185-8">[185-8]</a> The lower the rate of interest, the larger, in
highly civilized countries, is the stock on hand of cash apt to become, for
the reason that business men then hope to gain more by the advantages of
cash payments than by the saving of interest.<a id="fnanchor_185-9"></a> <a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_185-9">[185-9]</a><a id="fnanchor_185-10"></a>

<i>Proudhon's</i> idea, that this decline might at last bring about a
 total abolition of interest, is based on the same error as this other:
 that since a man may keep diminishing his per diem quantum of food, he
 might finally dispense with food altogether. <i>Proudhon's</i> Banque du
 Peuple—People's Bank—which, by gradually diminishing the
 interest on its loans to the minimum cost of its administration, should
 compel other capitalists to follow its example.</p>

 Thus, in England, by virtue of 37 Henry III., c. 9, the legal interest was
 = 10 per cent.; by 21 James I, c. 17 = 8; about 1651 = 6 per cent.
 (confirmed in 1660); by 12 Anne, ch. 16 = 5 per cent. In the time of
 George II., where the security was good, only 3 per cent. was, as a rule,
 paid. In France, the legal rate of interest, at the beginning of the 16th
 century, was 1/10 of the capital; after 1657, 1/12; 1601 (<i>Sully</i>),
 1/16; 1634 (<i>Richelieu</i>), 1/18; 1665 (<i>Colbert</i>), 1/20. Compare
 <i>Forbonnais</i> Recherches et Considérations, I, 48, 225, 385 ff. It
 continued at this rate of 5 per cent. with short interruptions until the
 revolution. (<i>Warnkönig</i>, Franz. Staats. und Rechtsgeschichte, II,
 588 seq.)</p>
<p class="footnote">The rates of interest in Russia, in the 16th century,
 had already declined to 20 per cent. (<i>Herberstein</i>, Reise, 41 ff.;
 <i>Karamsin</i>, Russ. Geschichte, VII, 169.) In Holland, in 1623, it was
 estimated that land purchases paid 3 per cent.; hypothecations, 4 to 6;
 deposits, 5 to 6; a flourishing business, 10 per cent. Compare
 <i>Usselinx</i> in <i>Laspeyres</i>, Geschichte der volkswirthschaftl.
 Anschauungen der Niederländer, 76. About 1660, the rate of interest usual
 in Italy and Holland was at most 3 per cent. (in war times, 4); in France,
 7; in Scotland, 10; in Ireland, 12; in Spain, 10 to 12; in Turkey, 20 per
 cent. (<i>Sir J. Child</i>, Discourse on Trade, French translation, 75
 ff.) Side by side with 6 per cent. as the rate of interest in England, it
 was (a little later) 10 in Ireland. <i>Petty</i>, Political Anatomy of
 Ireland, 74.</p>
<p class="footnote">The same course of things is to be observed in ancient
 times. In <i>Solon's</i> time, and again in that of <i>Lysias</i>, it was
 18 per cent. (<i>Böckh</i>, Staatshaushalt der Athener, I, 143 ff.) I am
 of opinion that the rate of interest declined during this long interval,
 but rose again in consequence of the Peloponnesian<a id="fnanchor_TN21"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN21">[TN
 21]</a> war. Among friends, in the time of <i>Demosthenes</i>, 10 per
 cent. (adv. Onetor., I, 386.) <i>Aristotle</i>, Rhet., III, 10, mentions
 12 per cent., which <i>Aeschines</i>, adv. Ctes., 104, and
 <i>Demosthenes</i>, adv. Aph., I, 820, 824, call low. The rate of
 commercial interest in Egypt (146 before Christ) seems to have been 12 per
 cent. per annum. (<i>Letronne</i>, Recompense promise à celui, etc., 1833,
 7.) Contemporaneously in Rome, a similar rate of interest must have been
 considered usurious. (<i>Cicero</i>, ad. Att., I, 12.) Under the emperor
 <i>Claudius</i>, 6 per cent. (<i>Columella</i>, De Re rust., III, 3.)
 <i>Justinian</i> allowed <i>to personae illustres</i> 4 per cent. per
 annum. (L. 26 Cod., IV, 32.)</p>

 a much better capital, his rifle, only 5. Compare <i>v. Schözer</i>,
 Anfangsgründe, I, 28. <i>Mallthus</i>, Principles, ch. 5. According to
 <i>Ricardo</i>, ch. 6, the decline of the rate of interest because of the
 necessity of carrying on agriculture under harder conditions, must make
 all capital of which raw material forms a part more valuable; while the
 possessors of money-capital particularly find no indemnification.
 <i>Wakefield</i>, England and America, 1853, accounts for it by saying
 that production, besides the coöperation of capital and labor, needs "a
 field of employment;" and <i>Bastiat</i>, Harmonies, ch. 5, 13, by saying
 that with the advance of civilization, the results of former services lose
 in value as compared with later ones, because performed under less
 favorable circumstances.</p>

 nice distinction: If the increased amount <i>of</i> money in a state comes

 Thus the rate of interest in Rome fell from 12 to 4 per cent. when
 Octavian suddenly threw the treasures of conquered Egypt upon the market,
 and the price of commodities only doubled. When later commerce had divided
 this amount of money among the provinces, it rose again. (<i>Sueton.</i>,
 Oct., 41; <i>Dio C.</i>, LI, 17, 21; Oros, IV, 19.) <i>Law's</i> emissions
 of paper, in colossal amounts, depressed the rate of interest to 1¼ per
 cent. (<i>Dutot</i>, Réflexions, 990—Daire.) But as soon as the
 paper money had lost its value, the former condition returned. Similar

 While in Paris the capital safely invested paid 2½ to 3 per cent., 57 out
 of 61 <i>conseils généraux</i> declared, in 1845, that the rate of
 interest on hypothecations, in their departments, was always over 5 per
 cent.; 17 estimated it at an average of from 6 to 7 per cent.; 12 at from
 7 to 10; some said 12 and 15, and even 22 per cent. in the case of small
 sums loaned for a short time. (<i>Chegarny</i>, Rapport au Nom de la
 Commission de la Réforme hypoth., 29 Avril, 1851.) In Russia, at the
 beginning of this century, the rate of interest in the Baltic provinces
 was 6 per cent.; in Moscow, 10; in Taurien, 25; in Astracan, 30 per cent.
 (<i>v. Schlözer</i>, Anfangsgründe I, 102.) In 1750, in Naples, the rate
 of interest was from 3 to 5 per cent., in the provinces from 7 to 9 per

<p class="p2 center"><a id="S186"></a>SECTION CLXXXVI.</p>
<p class="center smaller">HISTORY OF THE RATE OF INTEREST.—CAUSES OF
A HIGH RATE IN THRIVING COMMERCIAL NATIONS.</p>
<p>There are, however, even where a people's economy is in a flourishing
condition, many obstacles which cause the decline of the rate of interest
to take a retrogressive course, or which at least may delay it for a
time.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 115]</span>To this category belong all the
modifications of a nation's economy alluded to in § 183.<a id="fnanchor_186-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_186-1">[186-1]</a> Among them, therefore, is every extension of
the limits of productive land. Let us suppose a nation which, its capital
and labor remaining the same in every respect, should suddenly double its
territory. The less productive places where investments were made in the
old province are now abandoned, and labor and capital emigrate to the new.
The result is, of course, an increase of the aggregate national income,
and, at the same time, a decrease of rent. (§ 157.) Hence, the interest on
capital and the wages of labor, taken together, must greatly increase.
Which of these two branches shall profit most and longest by the increase
will depend upon whether capital or the number of workmen increases most
rapidly.<a id="fnanchor_186-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_186-2">[186-2]</a> A similar effect must
be produced when, by changes or modifications in the commercial situation,
in the tariff, etc., a nation is enabled to obtain the means of subsistence
at cheaper rates from more fertile and less settled countries.<a id="fnanchor_186-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_186-3">[186-3]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 116]</span>The introduction of better methods
of production has very different immediate consequences, according as these
methods affect the commodities which minister to the wants peculiar to
workmen as a class, or do not. Let us suppose, as a first case, that the
cost of ordinary clothing is reduced one half by reason of newly discovered
material, better machines, etc. As in the case of the whole people, so also
in that of the owners of capital as consumers, there is, in consequence, an
addition to their enjoyment of life. Their interest as well as their
capital, compared with clothing material, would have become more valuable.
But the relation between capital and interest, that is, the rate of
interest, could not be directly changed. (Compare <i>infra</i>, note 3.)
Only when the working class employ their materially increased wages to
increase population; when in consequence hereof, their wages, estimated in
money, again decline beyond what it was before; when, therefore, the price
of a given quantity of labor declines, does the rate of interest rise,
although a portion of that which the workmen have lost may be added to rent
on account of the increased population?<a id="fnanchor_186-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_186-4">[186-4]</a> <a id="fnanchor_186-5"></a>
<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_186-5">[186-5]</a> If the
applicability of the new method of production is confined to articles of
luxury used by the upper classes, for instance to fine lace, the rate of
interest <span class="pagenum">[Pg 117]</span> usual in the country will be
affected thereby only to the extent that through the medium of commerce
such products are exchanged with foreign nations against commodities
consumed by the working classes. But there are very few improvements in
production which have not led to a greater cheapness of those things which
satisfy the wants of the working class; and this is especially clear in the
improvements in the means of transportation so usual in our day.</p>
<p>However, the increase of fixed capital, such as machines, railroads,
etc., once they are completed, may, at first, cause a depression of the
rate of wages, as well as an enhancement of the rate of interest; the
former from the fact that a number of workmen is thereby, at least
temporarily, thrown out of employment; the latter because the conversion of
so much circulating into fixed capital must diminish the supply of the
former.<a id="fnanchor_186-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_186-6">[186-6]</a></p>
<p>A second class of obstacles consists in the diminution of the supply of
capital. War, for instance, always causes such a destruction of capital,
and at the same time for the most part renders the reproduction of capital
more difficult to such a degree that the rate of interest is wont to rise
greatly.<a id="fnanchor_186-7"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_186-7">[186-7]</a> Something similar is true
of other great catastrophes and of extravagance on a large scale.<a id="fnanchor_186-8"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_186-8">[186-8]</a> Every state loan, whether intended <span class="pagenum">[Pg 118]</span> for direct consumption or to procure
capital for use (<i>Nutzkapitalien)</i>, decreases the supply of
circulating capital which most directly determines the market rate of
interest.<a id="fnanchor_186-9"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_186-9">[186-9]</a> <a id="fnanchor_186-10"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_186-10">[186-10]</a></p>

<a href="#fnanchor_186-1" class="pginternal">[186-1]</a>
<i>Wolkoff</i> very well shows that the economic progress of mankind is
 effected partly by the improvement of production, and partly by saving.
 The former increases the rate of interest, the latter lowers it.
 (Lectures, 182, 189. Compare <i>supra</i>, § 45.)</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_186-2"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_186-2" class="pginternal">[186-2]</a>
 Thus the rate of interest in Russia rose, after Catherine II. had
 conquered the provinces situated on the Black Sea. (<i>Storch</i>,
 Handbuch, II, 34.) The same is still more strikingly apparent in the
 judicious planting of agricultural colonies.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_186-3"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_186-3" class="pginternal">[186-3]</a>
 Abolition of the English corn laws! Foreign commerce when very
 advantageous, always adds to the well-being of the people; to the rate of
 interest, however, only to the extent that articles which are calculated
 to satisfy the wants of the working class become cheaper in consequence;
 and this in turn lowers the rate of wages. Let us suppose that a country
 had hitherto purchased yearly 10,000 barrels of wine for $1,000,000. It
 might now happen that, in consequence of an advantageous commercial
 treaty, for instance, the 10,000 barrels might be obtained for $500,000.
 If, after this, wine-drinkers want to spend $1,000,000 for wine as they
 did before, they of course double their consumption of wine, but the rate
 of interest remains unchanged. If, on the other hand, they leave their
 consumption of wine where it was before and apply the saved half million
 to effect an increased demand for home products, the capital required for
 this production is set free at the same time. Hence, the relation between
 the supply and demand for capital has not changed, abstraction made of
 certain difficulties in the transaction. Compare <i>Ricardo</i>,
 Principles, ch. 7, rectifying <i>Adam Smith</i>, Wealth of Nat., I, ch.
 9.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_186-4"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_186-4" class="pginternal">[186-4]</a>
 An increase in the rate of interest caused by a diminution in the rate of
 wages does not last long. Capital now increases more rapidly, and the
 increase is accompanied by an increased demand for labor. If, in the mean
 time, workmen have become accustomed to a lower standard of life, the
 increasing wages are followed by an increase of population: then the
 necessity of having recourse to the cultivation of land of a worse quality
 is an additional cause of a decreasing rate of interest. (Edinb. Rev.,
 March, 1824, 26.)</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_186-5"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_186-5" class="pginternal">[186-5]</a>
 According to this, it is easy to tell what influence the increasing skill
 or activity of the working class (for instance by a decrease in the number
 of holidays, coöperation of wife and child) must have. Where there has
 been no accompanying and corresponding elevation of the standard of life,
 and of the want of the class, the gain soon falls to the lot of the
 capitalists or landowners.</p>

 See the very clear but not entirely complete discussion in <i>John Stuart
 Mill</i>, Principles, IV, ch. 3 ff. When new railways, machines, etc.,
 before they are complete, simultaneously increase the rate of interest and
 the rate of wages, and even sometimes rent, although they do not
 immediately increase the national income in any way, the phenomena are to
 be explained, not by a distribution of income, but as the result of an
 advance of capital made.</p>

 Compare <i>supra</i>, § 184. The rise of the rate of interest in Basil,
 between 1370 and 1393, <i>Arnold</i> (loc. cit.) accounts for by the wars
 and defeats of the upper German cities. Similarly in Zürich, 1457.
 (<i>Joh. Müller</i>, Schweizer Geschichte, IV, 211.) During the time
 immediately following the Spanish war of succession, the <i>usuriers les
 flus modérés</i> in France got 12-15 per cent. a year. (<i>Dutot</i>,
 Réflexions, 1866.) In Russia the rate of interest, after the war of
 1805-15, rose by 4-5 per cent. (<i>Storch</i>, Handbuch, 35 seq.) Per

 Thus the Hamburg conflagration, combined with the bad harvests of 1841,
 raised the rate of interest in Mecklenburg for a long series of years.
 Similarly in Würtemburg, the many bad harvests from 1845 to 1853, which
 are said to have caused a deficiency of 50,000,000 florins. (Tübinger
 Zeitschr., 1856, 568.)</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_186-9"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_186-9" class="pginternal">[186-9]</a>
 In bad times, state loans are usually effected at a disproportionally high
 rate of interest. This also operates momentarily on the general rate of
 interest, to the injury of persons engaged in business enterprises; who,
 by the very fact of the withdrawal of so much capital, become involved in
 an unfavorable competition. In the long run, indeed, the high or low rates
 of interest paid by national debts, in so far as the creditor cannot
 demand reimbursement, has no influence on the rate of interest usual in
 the country. Such debts as cannot be declared due assume the character of
 stationary capital, the value in exchange of which is determined by their
 yearly return, capitalized at the rate of interest usual in the country.
 (<i>Hermann</i>, Staatswirthschaftliche<a id="fnanchor_TN22"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN22">[TN

 The coöperation of most of the causes above mentioned raised the English
 rate of interest which had sunk to 3 per cent. to an average of 5, from
 about 1760 to 1816. Thus <i>Gauss</i>, in a manuscript work which I have
 used, relates that the fund for the support of professors' widows in
 Göttingen was, in 1794, expected to pay only 3 per cent. In 1799, the
 trustees observed that their capital could often be safely invested at 4
 per cent.; somewhat later the rate of interest rose to 5 per cent., at
 which point it remained for years. About 1843 ff. the rate of interest in
 old Bavaria was only 4 per cent.; in more highly cultured Rhenish Bavaria,
 5 per cent.</p>

<p class="center smaller">HISTORY OF THE RATE OF INTEREST.—EMIGRATION
OF CAPITAL.</p>
<p>Midway between these classes of obstacles lies the very usual proceeding
of highly civilized nations whose rate of interest is low, to transfer
their capital into countries with a higher rate of interest, where the
production of raw material is predominant.<a id="fnanchor_187-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_187-1">[187-1]</a> This is most thoroughly accomplished by the <span class="pagenum">[Pg 119]</span> emigration for good of the capitalists
themselves; but also least frequently, because the natural attachment of
man to his native country is usually too powerful, among the well-to-do
classes, to be overcome by the attraction of a higher rate of interest.
Temporary settlements in foreign countries are by far more frequent. Either
the capitalist removes there himself, for a time, to return enriched, at
farthest, in his old age; or he establishes a permanent branch of his
business there, and superintends it through the agency of a trusted
representative. The inhabitants of northern Italy, during the last
centuries of the middle ages, maintained such establishments, not only for
the purpose of carrying on commerce in merchandise along the shores of the
Levant, but also the money trade in the principal countries of the west.<a id="fnanchor_187-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_187-2">[187-2]</a> Similarly, the Hanseatic <span class="pagenum">[Pg 120]</span> cities contemporaneously in the north and
northeast of Europe; and, to-day, the English in almost all the important
seaport cities in the world.<a id="fnanchor_187-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_187-3">[187-3]</a> Such enterprises are always somewhat dangerous,
especially in countries but little advanced in civilization.<a id="fnanchor_187-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_187-4">[187-4]</a></p>
<p>The best means to facilitate the migration of capital is credit. It is,
indeed, true, that in international trade, ordinary private loans are
seldom made. To make such loans would be to run too many risks; risks
through a want of knowledge of persons or circumstances, on account of the
difficulties in the way of continued supervision, and of being able to
assert and defend one's rights away from home.<a id="fnanchor_187-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_187-5">[187-5]</a> Loans are much more readily made to foreign states,
to great corporations, or joint-stock <span class="pagenum">[Pg 121]</span>
companies, whose condition is well-known; and which, by reason of their
perpetuity, have a deep and obvious interest in maintaining an honorable
reputation. The issuing of certificates of stock, etc., has greatly
facilitated international trade in capital.<a id="fnanchor_187-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_187-6">[187-6]</a> But the mode of loaning in foreign parts preferred
is to sell them commodities, and to require payment for them only after
some time has elapsed, of course, with interest. Purchases, on the
contrary, are paid for immediately, possibly even in advance.<a id="fnanchor_187-7"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_187-7">[187-7]</a> The lower the rate of interest in a <span class="pagenum">[Pg 122]</span> country is, the longer and more cheaply can

<i>Nebenius</i>, Der öffentliche Credit, 83 ff. After the end of the
 Napoleonic war, English capital flowed, by way of preference, towards
 South America, afterwards towards Spain and Portugal; after 1830, to North
 America; after 1840, towards Germany and France, to be invested in the
 construction of railways in the latter countries.</p>

 The inhabitants of Asti began in 1226 to carry on the trade in money in
 trans-Alpine counties. In 1256, <i>Louis IX</i>. ordered 150 Asti
 money-changers to be thrown into prison, and he confiscated the money they
 had loaned in France, to the amount of over 800,000 livres. They were
 afterwards turned over to their enemy, the Count of Savoy, as usurers.
 (<i>Muratori</i>, Scr. Rerum Ital., XI, 142 seq.) About 1268, Louis IX.
 banished all money-changers of Lombard or Cahors origin: they were allowed
 only three months in which to collect their debts. (<i>Sismondi</i>,
 Histoire des Fr., VIII, 112.) About 1277, again all Italian money dealers
 were imprisoned, and 120,000 gold guldens extorted from them. (<i>Giov.
 Villani</i>, VII, 52.) After the Lombards had lost their freedom, the
 business passed into the hands of the Florentines and of the inhabitants
 of Lucca. (<i>Sismondi</i>, Gesch. der ital. Republiken, IV, 602;
 <i>Dante</i>, Inferno, XXI, 38.) Great part played by the brothers
 Franzesi as dealers in articles of luxury, and loaners on pledge etc., at
 the court of Philip IV. They seem to have instigated the persecution of
 other Italian money dealers, in 1291, from jealousy. (<i>Sismondi</i>,
 Histoire des Fr., VIII, 429 seq.) Great losses of the Florentines by the
 English-French war in 1337: Edward III. remained in the debt of his
 bankers Peruzzi and Bardi to the amounts respectively of 135,000 and
 184,000 marks sterling; so that they and many others failed. France
 imprisoned all the Italian money dealers, and compelled them to pay a
 large amount of ransom-money. (<i>G. Villani</i>, XI, 71.) In 1376, the
 Pope who was engaged in a struggle with Florence, called upon all princes
 to despoil all Florentine merchants within their jurisdiction of their
 wealth, and to sell them as slaves; and France and England actually did
 so. (<i>Sismondi</i>, Geschichte der ital. Republiken, V, 257 seq., VII,

 Thus even the emperor Paul of Russia caused the property of English
 factors to be confiscated. The galleons which Holland and England captured
 in the Spanish war of succession belonged mostly to Amsterdam houses.
 (<i>Ranke</i>, Franz. Gesch., IV, 226.) Even <i>Galiani</i>, Della Moneta,
 IV, 3, thinks that, on this account, such commerce is incompatible with
 the warlike spirit. It is certain, however, that a government like the
 English would do well not to permit a war with such countries as Russia or
 the United States to break out too suddenly, that their subjects might
 have time to collect all their outstanding dues. When, in 1855, it was
 reported in London that all Russian drafts were dishonored, people looked
 upon that fact as the surest sign of coming war. English merchants had
 called in their advances to Russia during the preceding economic period,
 and refused to make new ones.</p>

 This of course disappears when the borrowing country is dependent on the
 loaning country. Thus, the Canton of Uri formerly prohibited the
 inhabitants of the Livinerthal to borrow capital except from them. It is
 said that, at the beginning of this century, the Uri capital then loaned
 amounted to one-half a million florins, that is, an average of 250 per
 householder. Now it is not over one-fifth of that amount.
 (<i>Franscini</i>, Canton Tessin, 126.) Think also of the plantation
 colonies! But even the East Indies may be looked upon as a species of
 colony for England. Hence <i>Fawcett</i>, Manual, 105, is rightly of the
 opinion that no other country has the possibility of being as useful to
 the East Indies as England. And in fact, the East Indian railways obtained
 of their capital of £82,500,000, only a very small part, £800,000, in
 India itself, a very small proportion of which latter sum was subscribed
 by the native population. (Ausland 24, Juli, 1869.)</p>

 What England is to-day, the Italian commercial cities were in the 16th and
 17th centuries, viz.: the chief market for foreign loans. (Compare
 <i>Mun,</i> England's Treasure, 1664, ch. 4.) The Genovese loaned money in
 foreign countries at 2 and 3 per cent. (<i>Montanari</i>, Della Moneta,
 1867, cap. 2.) It is said that the Dutch, in 1778 invested 1,500 millions
 of livres in foreign national debts, especially those of France and
 England. (Richesse de Hollande, II, 178.) According to <i>J. G.
 Forster</i>, Schriften, III, 335, in 1781 alone, in Europe, 800 millions
 loaned capital. The Niederl. Jaerboek of 1789, p. 729, estimates the
 amount of interest coming from abroad, English and French not included, at
 from 50 to 60 millions of florins. About 1844, according to official
 estimates, 1,000 million florins in foreign loans, that is one-third of
 whole national income. (Allgemeine Zeitung, 1844, No. 35.) Now, Belgium,
 300 million florins, in Austrian evidences of indebtedness. (Quarterly
 Review, October, 1862, 402.) According to <i>Baumstark</i>,
 Staatswissensch. Versuche über Staatscredit, etc., 1833, 77, foreign
 nations, between 1818 and 1825, borrowed in England £49,000,000; and,
 about the same time, England participated in Russian, French and North
 American loans to the extent of £55,500,000. It is said that there were,
 in 1843, £25,000,000 English capital in the canals, railroads and banks of
 the United States. (<i>Porter</i>, Progress of the Nation, III, 4,

 It is evident, from many of Demosthenes' orations on private matters, that
 Athens was in the habit of advancing the commercial capital needed by a
 great part of the inhabitants of the Mediterranean coast. Many colonial
 cities, Phaselis, for instance, had the very worst reputation in this
 respect. They were virtually pirates as regards Athens. (Adv. Lacrit.,
 931.) Here also it seems that the goods taken for the loan had to be
 brought to Athens. (941.) On the regular advances of Prussian merchants to
 their Lithuanian and Polish vendors, in the 15th century, while the former
 were forbidden even to buy on credit, see <i>Hirsch</i>, Geschichte des
 Danziger Handels, 167, 177. In Colbert's time, the Dutch gave 12 months
 credit in Europe. (<i>J. De Wit</i>, Mémoires, 184.) In England,
 <i>Child</i> perceives a great advance in this: that in 1650, in all
 business in the interior, there was a credit of 3 to 18 months given; and
 in 1669, everything was paid for in cash. (Discourse on Trade, 45.)
 Concerning previous times, see <i>W. Raleigh</i>, Observations touching
 Trade and Commerce with the Hollander and other nations, 1603. (Works,
 VIII, 951 ff.) In North America, merchants in the interior frequently
 purchase their goods of importers on 6 months credit. (<i>Tellkampf</i>,
 Beiträge, I, 52.) In the West Indies, about the end of the last century,
 the English gave a credit, generally, of from 12 to 16 months. (<i>B.
 Edwards</i>, History of the British West Indies, II, 383.) In Brazil, in
 the case of imports, 4, 8 and even 12 months credit; payment in monthly
 installments, and frequently even longer delay, without interest. In the
 case of exports, when cash payments are not made, 1 per cent. a month,
 (<i>v. Reden</i>, Garn und Leinenhandel, 332.) Recently only about 40 per
 cent. of foreign advances are made at 12 to 20 months, 60 per cent. at
 from 50 to 70 days. (Tübing. Zeitschr., 1864, 517.)</p>
<p class="footnote">In Buenos Ayres, the producer or collector of export
 articles required the price to be paid usually a long time in advance
 (<i>habilitacion</i>), a very bold but necessary procedure, on account of
 his poverty. (<i>Robertson</i>, Letters on S. America, I, 174 ff.) In the
 corn trade in South Russia, at least one-half of the purchase money was
 required to be paid in advance, and even before shipment, the other half
 as soon as the corn arrived in the harbor, and, hence, sometimes, long
 before it was put on board. (<i>W. Jacob</i>, On the Corn Trade of the
 Black Sea, 23.) Compare <i>Tooke</i>, View of the Russian Empire, I, 339,
 Richesse de Hollande, II, 43, <i>Storch</i>, Handbuch, II, 61 seq. Russia
 was, about 1770, a credit-giving nation to the still poorer Persians.
 (<i>Gmelin</i>, Reise, III, 413.) The Spaniards also, in their American
 colonies, had always an expedition ready and waiting, the payment for
 which was made on the arrival of the second. (<i>Depons</i>, Voyage dans
 la Terre Firme, II, 368.) Moreover, active commerce simply, especially
 when circuitous, may be considered as in some way an international loan;
 and thus it is that the favorable "balance," by means of which
 claim-rights are obtained in foreign countries, is secured.</p>

 spite of all the French ambassador could do, the English immediately after
 the conclusion of peace, attracted the greatest part of American trade to
 themselves. (<i>Chaptal</i>, de l'Industrie Fr., I, 103.) Countries with a
 low rate of interest have an advantage in this respect, which grows after
 the manner of compound interest, when the duration of the advance of
 capital is prolonged. (<i>Senior</i>, Outlines, 195.)</p>

A LOW RATE ON STATIONARY NATIONS.</p>
<p>Beneficial as the spur of a low rate of interest is for countries
capable of development, it is a heavy drag on a stationary people, and more
so on those who have lost a portion of the field for the investment of
their capital by the competition of too powerful rivals.<a id="fnanchor_188-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_188-1">[188-1]</a> A real superabundance of capital is attended
with cares and temptations for the middle classes very similar to those
caused by a so-called over-population, especially to dishonesty and
extravagance.<a id="fnanchor_188-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_188-2">[188-2]</a> When capital,
population and the skillfulness of labor remaining the same, continues to
increase, the enlarged capital may very readily have every succeeding year
only the same return to divide among its owners, that the smaller had in
previous years.<a id="fnanchor_188-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_188-3">[188-3]</a> Hence additional saving
here would produce no real enrichment of the people; and it might even
happen that the instinct to accumulate capital might in <span class="pagenum">[Pg 124]</span> the future become torpid to a greater
degree than the capital itself had increased. In any case, however, the
decline of the rate of interest can continue only to a certain point. There
are numberless persons who would rather consume their capital, or invest it
in hazardous speculations than put it out at interest at one per cent. a
year.<a id="fnanchor_188-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_188-4">[188-4]</a> At least, the tendency
of a decline in the rate of interest is, in the case of the richer, to
increase the amount of capital consumed as compared with productive
capital. The more moderate, sober and provident a people are, the lower may
the rate of interest decline without producing this effect. And so, the
more the capital of a nation is concentrated in the hands of a few; because
then the owners of capital are all the later forced to break in upon it,
for the sake of subsistence.<a id="fnanchor_188-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_188-5">[188-5]</a> <a id="fnanchor_188-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_188-6">[188-6]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 125]</span>Among nations which have totally
declined, the rate of interest is wont to reach a high point once more; the
natural result of great losses of capital and men, while, at the same time,
the freedom of the lower classes and the security of property have been
either curtailed or lost. The weakness of age is, in many respects, even in
the case of nations, a second childhood.<a id="fnanchor_188-7"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_188-7">[188-7]</a></p>

 misfortune: "they receive it with tears, not knowing how to dispose of it
 to interest with such safety and ease." On Italy, see <i>Bandini</i> (ob.

 Think only of the so-called commercial crises, the speculation-rage
 preceding which is excited by the lowness of the rate of interest, the
 destruction of capital in which makes the rate of interest to retrograde
 materially. However, this very decline is, in itself, only a spur to
 speculation in evidences of national indebtedness, stocks, etc., in
 commodities, only where, without such speculation, a rise in prices was to
 be expected. Thus, for instance, the great English periods of speculation:
 1796 ff., in colonial products; 1808 ff., in raw materials in general;
 1814, in articles of export, were times in which there was not the
 slightest facility in obtaining credit. (<i>Tooke</i>, History of Prices,

 As the symptoms of a condition are very frequently mistaken for its cause,
 there have been many writers who, blinded especially by the contemplation
 of Holland, considered the lowness of the rate of interest as the <i>causa
 causans</i> of all wealth, and who promised really magical results from
 its legislative regulation by the state. Thus <i>Sir Thomas Culpeper</i>,
 A Tract against the high Rate of Usury, 1623; continuation 1630; <i>Sir J.
 Child</i>, Brief Observations concerning Trade and the Interest of Money,
 1668; Discourse of Trade, 1690. <i>Anderson</i> (ob. 1765), was of a
 similar opinion: Origin of Commerce, a. 1601, 1651; and even
 <i>Ganilh</i>, Dictionnaire analytique, 99 seq. (<i>Infra</i>, § 162.) Per
 <i>contra</i>, the anonymous essay, Interest of Money mistaken, 1668, and
 <i>Locke</i>, Considerations of the Consequences of the Lowering of
 Interest and Raising the Value of Money, 1691. Most moderns have
 considered the decline of the rate of interest an evil. Thus, for
 instance, <i>Canard,</i> Principes, ch. 5, who uniformly makes this the
 starting point of a nation's downfall. See also <i>McCulloch</i>,
 Principles, III, 8. <i>Malthus</i> draws a comparison between the saving
 of capital and the generation of children: only a high rate of interest
 makes the former really useful, and a high rate of wages the latter.</p>
<p class="footnote">Even great destruction and disturbances of capital by
 war, by loans to the state, for instance, are soon made good, provided the
 sources of the saving of capital are not dried up. (Principles, III, 370
 ff., 401, ff.) <i>John Stuart Mill</i> expressly counsels rich and highly
 civilized nations not to neglect beneficent enterprises, although
 economically unproductive, because capital might be lost in them. The
 result of such a loss would, under certain circumstances, simply be that
 less capital would be exported or wasted in speculation. (Principles, II,
 ch. 5, 1.) Similarly <i>Canard</i>, who, therefore, compares state loans
 with blood-letting, as a remedy for a plethoric disease. (Ch. 9.)
 <i>Turgot</i> confounded cause and effect when he compared a high rate of
 interest to an inundation, below the level of which nothing can be
 produced; and which, the lower it became, the more dry ground there was
 for men to work on. (Sur la Formation, etc., § 89.)</p>

 of 5 per cent. a month; at least 1½ or 2. (<i>Rohlfs</i>, von Tripolis
 nach Alexandrien, 1871, I, 22.) In most of the East Indian kingdoms, the
 rate of interest is so high for the government itself that when the
 creditor, even without a return of the capital, gets the interest only for
 a few years, he is considered passably well indemnified. (<i>J. S.

<p class="center smaller">INTEREST-POLICY.—LEGITIMATENESS OF
INTEREST.</p>
<p>The legitimateness of interest is based on two unquestionable grounds:
on the real productiveness of capital, and on the real abstinence from
enjoyment of it by one's self.<a id="fnanchor_189-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_189-1">[189-1]</a> Let us <span class="pagenum">[Pg 126]</span> suppose a nation of fishermen with no
private ownership in land and no capital, living naked in caverns, on
sea-fish which the ebb of the ocean has left in the puddles along the
shore, and which are caught only with the hand.<a id="fnanchor_189-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_189-2">[189-2]</a> All workmen here may be equal, and each catch and
consume three fish a day. Let us again suppose that some clever savage
reduces his consumption to two fish a day, for one hundred days, and uses
the stock of one hundred fish collected in this way to enable him to devote
all his strength and labor, during fifty days, to the construction of a
boat and a net. With the aid of this capital he, from the first, catches
thirty per day. What now will his fellow tribesmen, who are not capable of
such intelligent and systematic self control to do as he has done, do? What
will they offer him for the use of his capital? In discussing this question
both parties will very certainly consider not only the fifty days' labor
spent in the construction of the boat, etc., but also the one hundred and
fifty days during which its maker had to abstain from his full ration of
food. If the borrower, of the thirty fish which may be caught daily with
the aid of his capital, gives twenty-seven away, his condition is at least
no worse than it was at first. On the other hand, the lender, if
compensated only for the wear and tear of his capital, would reap no profit
whatever from his loan. The interest to be paid will be fixed somewhere
between these two extremes by the relation between demand and supply. A
loan which pays no interest is a donated use <span class="pagenum">[Pg
127]</span> of capital. (<i>Knies.</i>)<a id="fnanchor_189-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_189-3">[189-3]</a> Interest may be called the reward of abstinence
(<i>Senior</i>), in the same way as wages is called the reward of
industry.<a id="fnanchor_189-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_189-4">[189-4]</a> With the abolition of
interest, exchange would be limited to the mere present, without any
mediation between the past and the future. A great number of services would
bring no equivalent in return, and, therefore, as a <span class="pagenum">[Pg 128]</span> rule, never be performed. Most of the
charges commonly made in our day against the "tyranny of capital" are, at
bottom, only a complaint that capital is not inexhaustible; and even those
workmen who are obliged to pay most to capital would be much worse off
without it.</p>

 The Greeks very appropriately call interest τόκος,<a id="fnanchor_TN23"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN23">[TN
 23]</a> i. e., that which is born. In the loaning of capital productively
 invested, the creditor, in the interest received, consumes the real
 produce of his property. If the debtor has consumed the property
 unproductively, the creditor indeed lives on the debtor's other returns or
 supplies; which, however, without his intervention would probably have
 been consumed by their owner.</p>

 We here, for the time being, make abstraction of all entangling

 the Ichthyographs; also <i>Hildebrand</i>, Reise, um die Erde, III, 2, in

 The most recent relapse into the old error of the unproductiveness of
 capital, viz.: that of <i>Karl Marx</i> (Das Kapital; Kritik der polit.
 Oekonomie, I, 167) is a turning round and round of the author in the
 vicious circle of his demonstration. If the value of every commodity
 depends simply on the labor necessary to bring it into existence, or on
 the time of labor required to produce it, it is self-evident that the
 value of the capital consumed for the purpose of its production, can at
 most be only preserved in the new product, and that all the additional
 value (<i>Mehrwerth</i>) of the latter should be ascribed to labor. (172,
 and passim.) Hence, strictly speaking, the capitalist who advances capital
 to workmen, is still bound in duty to be grateful to the latter when the
 value of his advance is preserved to him undiminished, (§ 173) and all
 interest levied by him should be considered as a payment towards the
 extinguishment of the capital [debt] itself. (556.) Relying on such
 theories, many socialists admit private property and even the right of
 inheritance to means of enjoyment and use capital
 (<i>Gebrauchskapitalien</i>) provided only that land and productive
 capital should pass over into the "collective property" of society, with
 compensation, however, to their former owners. Considering the short
 duration of most goods used in enjoyment or consumed, the evil
 consequences of a community of goods mentioned in § 81, could not be
 avoided to any extent by this means.</p>
<p class="footnote">How entirely fallacious the above assumption is, is
 seen most strikingly in the case of such goods as cigars, wine, cheese,
 etc., which, without the least addition of labor, by merely postponing the
 consumption of them, obtain a much larger value both in exchange and in
 use. Or, how would it be possible, for instance, to reduce the value of a
 hundred-year-old tree, over and above the cost of planting it, to labor
 alone? Similarly, the fact that on a Chilian <i>hacienda</i>, 25 per cent.
 of the cattle can be slaughtered and no diminution of the herd take place.
 (<i>Wappäus</i>, M. und S. Amerika, 784.) <i>Strassburger</i> rightly
 inquires: if all the profit of capital is based on a cheating of workmen
 by capitalists, who is cheated in the case in which a manufacturer without
 workmen earns more with an increased capital than before with a small
 capital? (<i>Hildebrand's</i> Jahrb., I, 103.)</p>

 In a time full of nabobism and pauperism, when some can, without the least
 abstinence, make immense savings, and others none at all even with the
 greatest abstinence, we may comprehend where the socialists find food for
 their derision of the expression, "reward of abstinence."</p>

<p class="center smaller">INTEREST-POLICY.—AVERSION TO INTEREST.</p>
<p>At the same time, there is a strong aversion to the taking of interest
prevalent among nations in a low stage of civilization. Industrial
enterprises of any importance do not as yet exist here at all, and
agriculture is most advantageously carried on by means of a great many
parcels of land, but with little capital. The purchase of land is so rare,
and hampered by legal restrictions to such a degree, that loans for that
purpose are almost unheard of. And just as seldom does it happen, by reason
of the superabundance of land, that the heir of a landowner borrows capital
to effect an adjustment with his co-heirs, and thus enter alone into the
possession of the estate. Here, as a rule, only absolute want leads to
loaning.<a id="fnanchor_190-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_190-1">[190-1]</a> If, in addition to
this, we consider the natural height of the rate of wages in such times,
the small number and importance of the capitalist class (§ 201), the tardy
insight of man into the course and nature of economic production,<a id="fnanchor_190-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_190-2">[190-2]</a> it will not be hard to understand <span class="pagenum">[Pg 129]</span> the odium attached in the middle age of

<p>Most religions, the Christian excepted (the universal religion!), have
been founded in the earlier stages of the nations who profess them, and
have there, at least outwardly, exercised their greatest influence. No
wonder, therefore, that so many religions have prohibited the taking of
interest. Thus, for instance, the Jewish which, indeed, allows interest to
be taken from foreigners, but raises loaning without interest among Jews in
their commerce with one another, to the dignity of a duty binding on the
conscience of the beneficent rich.<a id="fnanchor_190-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_190-4">[190-4]</a> <a id="fnanchor_190-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_190-5">[190-5]</a> Similarly in the
Koran.<a id="fnanchor_190-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_190-6">[190-6]</a> The Fathers of the
Church, <span class="pagenum">[Pg 130]</span> also, on the whole, look

 Thus <i>Aristotle</i>, calls the taking of interest a gain against nature,
 since money is only a medium of exchange, and cannot produce its like.
 (Polit., 3, 23, Schn.) Similarly, <i>Plato</i>, De Legg., V, 742, and
 <i>Seneca</i>, De Benef., VII, 10. Compare, however, <i>Tacit</i>., Annal,
 XIII, 42 seq. As late a writer as <i>Forbonnais,</i> 1754, accounts for
 interest thus: Some people hoard their money instead of spending it; hence
 a scarcity or want of money, and those who need it are obliged, in order
 to draw it out, to promise to pay interest. (Eléments de Commerce, II, 92

 Numerous disturbances on account of debt, during the first centuries of
 the Roman Republic, until finally (compare <i>Livy</i>, VII, 42), the
 taking of interest was in the year 349 (?) before Christ, entirely
 prohibited. (<i>Tacit.</i>, Annal. VI, 16.) The public opinion in such
 matters may be understood from the words of Cato: <i>majores ita in
 legibus posuerunt, furem dupli condemnari, foeneratorem quadrupli</i>. (De
 Re rust.) The <i>foenerari</i> compared with the <i>hominem occidere</i>.
 (<i>Cato</i>, in <i>Cicero</i>, De Off., II, 25.) In the higher stages of
 civilization little heed was paid to the law, in practice (compare
 <i>Livy</i>, XXXV, 7; <i>Plut.</i>, Cato, I, 21.), although the democratic
 party always held fast to the legal perpetuation of the prohibition of
 interest. (<i>Mommsen</i>, Römisch. Gesch., III, 493.)</p>

 restored. (Net. 5, 1 ff.) Was there, in the long duration of such
 prescriptions, an educational measure having reference to the peculiar
 fault towards which the Jewish national character had a special tendency?
 In Josephus's time even, usury practiced on one's country people was
 universally despised (Antiq. Jud., IV, 8, 25.), and the Talmud continues
 it. Compare <i>Michaelis</i>, De Mente ac Ratione Legis M. Usuram
 prohibentis. In Russia, the orthodox Jews are wont to evade the legal rate
 of interest by exacting one-half the profit, and estimating it
 approximately in advance at a probable sum. If, afterwards, the debtor
 declares under oath that he made no profit, the creditor has no more to
 say; but then the borrower would lose all credit in the future. (<i>Bonav.

 way of preference, by a fictitious sale for cash, at prices out of all

principal debt until the creditor had restored all the interest obtained.
In the council of Vienna, in 1311, it was declared heresy to defend the
taking of interest. The universal antipathy of the church towards the
growing importance of the <i>bourgeoisie</i>,<a id="fnanchor_191-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_191-2">[191-2]</a> and the desire to give the spiritual courts an
extensive jurisdiction in litigated cases, may have contributed largely to
the adoption of these measures. In later medieval times, the secular power
offered its services to execute these laws;<a id="fnanchor_191-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_191-3">[191-3]</a> and, to judge of what public <span class="pagenum">[Pg 132]</span> opinion in this matter was, we need only call to
mind the decided disapproval of interest by Dante, Luther and
Shakespeare.<a id="fnanchor_191-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_191-4">[191-4]</a></p>
<p>The <i>Weddeschat</i>, a species of pledge or loan on security,
constituted the transition from this state of things to the modern economic
system of interest. The <i>Weddeschat</i> was a sale with a reserved right
of redemption, by which the debtor gave his creditor the use and enjoyment
of a piece of land a sort of interest in kind, but which he could at any
time recover back, by payment of the principal. This was not very
oppressive on the debtor, as he was the only party who could recall the
contract.<a id="fnanchor_191-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_191-5">[191-5]</a> In a higher stage of
civilization, <span class="pagenum">[Pg 133]</span> indeed the continuance
of this species of land-pledge would be exceedingly disadvantageous, since
the momentary possessor of a piece of land which might be bought back by
another person at any time at a price fixed in advance, would scarcely
think of improving it.<a id="fnanchor_191-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_191-6">[191-6]</a></p>
<p>And so, the introduction of rent-purchase (<i>Rentekauf</i>) was an
important step in advance: the incumbrancing of a piece of land which
remained in the possession of the debtor with an interest in kind paid to
the creditor. The latter could never claim anything further, while the
debtor and his heirs might redeem the land from this interest-incumbrance
by paying back the purchase money.<a id="fnanchor_191-7"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_191-7">[191-7]</a> As the Pope, on the 19th of January, 1569,
renewed, in express terms, the prohibition of all interest not based on
rent-purchase, so did the police ordinances of the Empire, of the sixteenth
century, declare it to be the only lawful form of loaning at interest;
provided, always, that only the debtor could demand the cancellation of
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 134]</span> the contract.<a id="fnanchor_191-8"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_191-8">[191-8]</a> We find, however, that, on the whole, at least

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 135]</span>However, the long persistence of
the prohibition of the canon law in relation to interest, even with the

 The apostolic canons and several decrees of councils of the fourth century
 prohibit the taking of interest by the clergy. A Spanish provincial
 council dared, in 313, to extend the prohibition to the laity. Pope Leo I.
 condemned the taking of interest by the laity also, but only in the form
 of a moral law. (443.) The synod of Constantinople (814) punished the
 violation of the prohibition with excommunication. See <i>Thomas
 Aquin.</i> (ob. 1274.) De Usuris, in the Quæstiones disputatae et quod
 libetales. The canon law, however, always permitted delay-interest
 (<i>Verzugszinsen</i>), and Gregory IX, allowed <i>justa et moderata
 expensa et congruam satisfactionem damnorum</i> to be taken into account,
 (c. 17, X.) De Fora Comp. II, 2. A tacit recognition of the productiveness
 of capital is to be found in c. 7, X. De Donatt. inter. Virum. cett. IV,
 20; and the later schoolmen, <i>Antonin</i> and <i>Bernhardin</i>, (ob.
 1459 and 144) are pretty clear on the point. But <i>Albertus Magnus</i>
 had already recognized the <i>damnum emergens</i> and <i>Thomas
 Aquinas</i> the <i>lucrum cessans</i> as causes of interest. (Tübinger
 Zeitschr., 1869, 151, 159, 161.) The essentially modern character of Roman
 law, which, in the form it has finally assumed, is in harmony with a high
 development of national economy, accounts for the fact that the glosse of
 <i>Accursius</i> relying on <i>Irnerius</i> and <i>Bulgarus</i> entirely
 ignores the prohibition of interest. For a similar reason, in the 16th
 century, <i>Donellus</i> and <i>Cujacius</i> stand entirely on Roman
 ground. In the interval, indeed, men like <i>Bartolus</i> and
 <i>Baldus</i> were not disquieted by the canon law. (<i>Endemann</i>,
 Studien in der Römisch-Canonischen Wirtchaftsund Rechtslehre, I, 18, 27
 seq. 61.) Compare the rich historical material in <i>Salmasius</i>, De
 Usuris, 1638; De Modo Usurarum, 1639, and De Mutuo, 1640.</p>

 Thus the emperor Basil, in the year 867, as <i>Justinian</i> had before
 him, forbade the further payment of interest, once the amount already paid
 equaled the principal. (L. 29 seq.; Cod. IV, 32, Nov., 121, 2.) Compare
 Sachsenspiegel, I, 54. <i>Edward the Confessor</i> is said to have issued
 the first prohibition of interest. (<i>Anderson</i>, Origin of Commerce,
 a. 1045.) <i>Edward III.</i> forbade all interest as the ruin of commerce.
 (Idem a., 1341.) About 1391, the lower House had its zeal aroused against
 the "shameful vice of usury;" and again, in 1488, all interest on money
 and all rent-purchases stipulated for on unlawful conditions, were
 threatened with a fine of £20, the pillory, and six months imprisonment.

<i>Dante</i>, Inferno, XI, 106 ff., suggests that interest-creditors had
 violated the command of <i>Moses</i>, I, 3. <i>Macchiavelli</i> seems to
 judge otherwise: Compare Istoria Fior., VII, a, 1464; VIII, a, 1478. Very
 interesting discussions on the legitimateness of the taking of interest in
 1353 seq., in which the Dominicans, up to the time of <i>Savonarola</i>,
 defended the strictest opinion. (<i>M. Villan</i>, III, 106.)
 <i>Luther</i>, Tract on Trade and Money, 1524, and Sermon on Usury, 1519.
 Later still, <i>Luther</i> became more moderate. Thus, in his letter to
 the Danzig counsel, 1525, in <i>Neumann</i>, Geschichte des Wuchers in
 Deutschland, 617 ff., in which, for instance, he blames the forcible
 carrying out of interest-prohibitions, draws a distinction between rich
 and poor, etc. So, too, in his letter: An die Pfarrherren, wider den
 Wucher zu predigen, 1540. <i>Melanchthon</i>, Phil. moral., 137 ff., is
 also more moderate. <i>Calvin</i> was clearer in this matter, and no
 longer recognized the canonical prohibition of interest. (Epistolæ et
 Responsa, Hanov., 1597, epist. 383.) Similarly <i>Zwinglius</i>, who will
 not praise interest, but considers it a natural consequence of property
 (Opp. ed. Tugur., 1530, I, 319 ff.), and even <i>Erasmus</i>, ad. Evang.
 Luc., 6, 44. Adagia v. Usuræ nautt. In <i>Shakespeare</i>, compare
 Merchant of Venice. <i>Bodinus</i> also rejects on principle, even Roman
 interest, which he held to be 1½ per cent. a year: De Republ., 1584, V. 2.
 Even the practical Dutch excluded the so-called "table-keepers," from the
 communion up to 1657. Compare the contests hereon in <i>Laspeyres</i>,

 The mutual right of cancellation (<i>Kündbarkeit</i>) in the case of these
 contracts during periods poor in capital and credit, would easily have
 ruined the debtor. Compare <i>J. Möser</i>, Patr. Ph., II, No. 18. Hence
 municipal rights in the latter part of the middle ages, which in many
 other respects are so antagonistic to Rome, have seldom anything to object
 to its measures in this matter.</p>

 The institution of rent-purchase (<i>Rentekauf</i>) was already developed
 in the Hanse cities at the beginning of the fourteenth century.
 (<i>Stobbe</i>, in the Zeitschr. f. deutsches Recht, XIX, 189 ff.) About
 1420, the bishops of Silesia inquired of the Pope, whether such contracts
 which had been the practice in Silesia for a century were lawful. The
 answer was a favorable one, although he left the rate of interest free in
 this particular case (Extr. Com. III, 5, 1, 2); after <i>Alexander
 IV.</i>, however, as early as 1258, had instructed inquisitors not to take
 part in litigations concerning usurious contracts. Formerly all such
 contracts were prohibited in express terms. (Decret. Greg., V. 19, 1, 2),
 although, in France, the ordinances of Louis IX. and Louis X. (1254 and
 1315) had established fixed rates of interest therefor. Between pledge and
 rent-purchase, the right of the (virtual) loaner to expel the (virtual)
 borrower, which after fell into disquietude, occupies, so to speak, a
 middle place. (Compare <i>Eichhorn</i>, D. St.- und R.-Gesch., II, § 361,
 a III, § 450.) It was decreed, in France, in 1565, that all rent in kind
 should be converted into money rent. (<i>Warnkönig</i>, Franz., St.- und
 R.-Gesch., II, 585 ff.)</p>

 A Prussian law allowing interest even without a contract of rent-purchase
 as far back as 1385. (<i>Voigt</i>, Geschich. von Preussen, V, 467.) In
 Marseilles, in 1406, a rate of interest of ten per cent. allowed.
 (<i>Anderson</i>, Origin of Commerce, s. a.) Likewise in England, 37 Henry
 VIII., c. 9. In Brandenburg, 1565, 6 per cent. (<i>Mylius</i>, C. C.,
 March, II, 1, 11.) A retrograde step by 5 and 6 Edward VI., c. 20; by
 which all interest was again prohibited. These laws had, practically, the
 effect of increasing interest to 14 per cent., and were therefore repealed
 in 1571. How unnatural the prohibition was is apparent from the fact that
 by 4 and 5 Philip and Mary, c. 2, the possessor of 1,000 marks was
 estimated equal to a person with £200 annual income. In Denmark, the
 taking of interest at 5 per cent. was allowed in 1554, since "although it
 is contrary to God's command, yet [according to an opinion given by
 <i>Melanchthon</i>] this commerce cannot be entirely abolished."
 (<i>Kolderup-Rosenvinge's</i> Dänische R. G., in <i>Homeyer</i>, § 142.)
 Similar views of the elector Augustus, 1583. (Cod. August 1, 139 ff.)</p>
<p class="footnote">The German Empire, in 1600, allowed the debtor to
 contract that, in case of delay, the contract might be declared annulled.
 In France, on the other hand, even during the 18th century, nearly all
 loans were made in the form of <i>rent-purchase</i> (<i>Law</i>, Trade and
 Money, 127), and the creditor could declare the contract void only in case
 the debtor did not pay him the rent. (<i>Warnkönig</i>, Franz. R. G., II,
 585 ff.) For strictly Catholic countries, the prohibition relating to the
 taking of interest still really remains. However, <i>Leo X.'s</i> bull,
 Inter multiplices, exempts the so-called <i>monti di pietà</i>, and by
 this means put obstacles in the way of saving, and promoted real usury. Of
 this last, <i>Niebuhr</i>, Briefe, II, 399, adduces very striking
 instances from the Pope's own temporal dominion. In the case of pledge,
 even 12 per cent. per annum is required. (Rom im Jahr, 1833, 163.) Yet, in
 1830, the Poenitentiaria Romana instructed the clergy, without, however,
 deciding the chief question, not to disquiet people any longer in the
 confessional who had taken interest. (<i>Guillaumin</i>, Dictionnaire de
 l'Economie politique, art. usure.) On the Russian Sect,
 <i>Staroverzen</i>, which still condemns the taking of interest, see
 <i>Storch</i>, Handbuch, II, 19. By the Russian government it was
 permitted very early. <i>Ewers</i>, Ältestes Recht der R., 323 seq.</p>

 The first scientific defense of interest is generally considered to be
 that of <i>Salmasius</i>, loc. cit. Yet <i>Bacon</i>, Sermones fideles, C.
 39 (after 1539), and at bottom also <i>H. Grotius</i>, De Jure Belli et
 Pacis, 1626, taught that it was lawful to take interest in so far as it
 was not against the love due to one's neighbor (<i>Endemann</i>, loc.
 cit., I, 62 ff.), and <i>Besold</i>, Quaestiones aliquot de Usuris, 1598,
 was as near the truth as <i>Salmasius</i>.<a id="fnanchor_TN24"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN24">[TN
 24]</a> Compare <i>supra</i>, note 4. How earnestly <i>North</i> and
 <i>Locke</i> labored against the lowering of interest by governmental
 interference, see <i>Roscher</i>, Z. Gesch. der engl. Volkswirths., 90,
 102 ff. The best writers, in strictly Catholic countries, did violence to
 themselves in this matter for a long time after. Thus <i>Galiani</i>,
 Della Moneta, II, I seq.; and one cannot help being greatly surprised at
 witnessing the subtleties which <i>Turgot</i>, Mémoire sur le Prêt
 d'Argent, 1769, had to have recourse to, to prove the clearest matters.
 Thus: at the moment of the loan, a sum of money is exchanged against the
 mere promise of the other party, which is certainly less valuable. [If it
 were not, why should he borrow?] This difference must, therefore, be made
 up in interest, etc. <i>Mirabeau</i> even was a decided opponent of
 interest. (Philos. rurale, ch. 6.) Compare, however, the theological
 defense by <i>Viaixnes</i>, 1728, in the Traité des Prêts de Commerce,
 Amsterdam, 1759, IV, 19 ff.</p>

 Of course, evaded in a thousand ways in practical life. Thus, for
 instance, people gave wheat, other commodities, and even uncoined gold and
 silver as loans, and had what interest they pleased promised them. In
 alienating the capital, they might stipulate <i>à fonds perdu</i>, as they
 thought best. (Turgot, I, c. § 29.) When debtors had promised under oath
 to make no complaint, the church ordered that they should be helped
 officially. When the temporal power showed itself lax, Alexander III.
 decreed that such questions should be brought before the spiritual courts.
 (Decret. Greg. V., tit. 19; 13 <i>Innocent</i>, Epist., VIII, 16; X, 61.)
 In England, <i>Richard of Cornwall</i> obtained a monopoly of the whole
 loaning business. (<i>Matth. Paris</i>, ed. 1694, 639: compare, also, 20
 Henry III., 5.), from which fact the existence of the custom of taking
 interest about 1235, is apparent. Cases in which English kings borrowed

 Ordonnances de la Fr., L. 53 seq. II, 575. Receuil des anciennes, Lois, I,

<p>Instead of the medieval prohibition of interest, most modern states have
established fixed rates of interest, the exceeding or evasion of which, by
contract or otherwise, is declared null and void, and is usually punishable
as usury.<a id="fnanchor_192-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_192-1">[192-1]</a> If the fixing of the

</a> it uniformly fails of its object. If <span class="pagenum">[Pg
137]</span> control were great enough, vigilant and rigid enough, which is
scarcely imaginable, to prevent all violations of the law, it is certain
that less capital would be loaned than had been, for the reason that every
owner of capital would be largely interested in employing his capital in
production of his own. More capital, too, would go into foreign parts, and
there would be less saved by those not engaged in any enterprise of their
own. All of this would happen to the undoubted prejudice of the nation's
entire economy.<a id="fnanchor_192-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_192-4">[192-4]</a> <a id="fnanchor_192-5"></a> <a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_192-5">[192-5]</a></p>
<p>If, on the other hand, the control by the government be not great
enough, the law would, in most cases, be evaded; especially as each party,
creditor as well as debtor, would find it to his advantage to evade it. The
latter, who otherwise <span class="pagenum">[Pg 138]</span> would not be
able to borrow at all, is, as a rule, more in need of obtaining the loan,
than the creditor is to invest his capital. How easily, therefore, might he
be induced to bind himself by oath or by word of honor!<a id="fnanchor_192-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_192-6">[192-6]</a> He would, moreover, be compelled to pay the
creditor not only the natural interest and the ordinary insurance premium,
but also for the special risk he runs when he violates the law threatening
him with a severe penalty.<a id="fnanchor_192-7"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_192-7">[192-7]</a> Hence the last result is either a material

 This is, historically, the second meaning of the word usury, while in the
 middle ages, for instance in England, under Elizabeth (<i>D. Hume</i>),
 the taking of any interest whatever was called usury. Science should

 In Switzerland, at the end of the 17th century, not only were those

 took less. (Compare Rechtsquellen von Basel, Stadt und Land, 1865, Bd.

 Fixed rates of interest of this kind are to be accounted for in part by a
 still continuing aversion of the legislator for interest in general; in
 part, by the opinion which prevails that precisely the most useful and
 most productive classes might be elevated by an artificial lowness of the
 rate of interest. (But most especially the government itself, which
 borrows more than it lends.) When Louis XIV. about 1665, lowered the rate
 of interest to 5 per cent., he claimed in the preamble to his decree that
 it would have the effect of promoting the welfare of landowners and
 business men, and of preventing idleness. Similarly <i>Sully</i>,
 Economies royales, L, XII. And so <i>J. Child</i>, Discourse of Trade, 69
 ff., says that every lowering of the rate of interest, by law, produced a
 completely corresponding increase of the national wealth. He says, since
 the first reduction (?) of interest in 1545, the national wealth increased
 six fold; since the last, in 1651, the number of coaches increased a
 hundred fold; chamber-maids wore now better clothes than ladies formerly;
 on 'Change there were more persons with a fortune of £10,000 than before
 with £1,000. Similarly <i>Culpeper</i>: compare <i>Roscher</i>, Z.
 Geschichte der eng. Volkswirthsch., 57 ff. Later, the French generally
 thought that a lowering of the rate of interest would prove injurious to
 the <i>noblesse de la robe</i>; hence even in 1634, parliament was opposed
 to it. (<i>Forbonnais</i>, Recherches et Considérations, I, 48, 226.)
 <i>Darjes</i> says that information of all loans of capital should be made
 to the police authorities, and that the authorities might compel payment
 and the loaning of the principal over again to parties in need of capital.
 (Erste Gründe, 426 seq.) Something analogous<a id="fnanchor_TN25"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN25">[TN

<i>Usurae palliatae</i>, interest taken out of the capital, or
 stem-interest, called also money-usury in contradistinction to patent
 interest-usury. To this category belong the written acknowledgments of
 indebtedness to a larger amount than that actually received; acknowledging
 it in a higher kind of money than that in which the loan was made; the
 compulsory taking by the debtor of commodities at a disproportionately
 high price, in the place of money, or at a disproportionately low one, by
 the creditor. See the enumeration of such things in the police regulations
 of the empire, 1530, art. 26, and 1548, art. 17. Thus, in Paris, jewels
 are "sold" to students hard-pressed for money, which immediately find
 their way to the <i>monts de piété</i>, and have to be paid for some time
 after to the usurious "seller," at a most exorbitant price. The person who
 loans $100 at 6 per cent., and retains the interest for the next following
 year from the date of the loan, takes in reality nearly 6.4 per cent.
 Fraudulent accessory expenses of all kinds, <i>faux frais</i>, expenses of
 registration, for prolongation, and extinguishment, etc. Here belong,
 also, the provisions introduced into contracts to make redemption more
 difficult, the fixing of terms of payment in such a manner that the debtor
 is almost forced to let them slip by—called "usury in the

 <i>Vasco</i>, Usura libera, § 57 ff. Recently, <i>Braun</i> und
 <i>Wirth</i>, Die Zinswuchergesetze, 1856, 190 ff. In view of the manifold
 business transactions behind which the interest-usurer may take refuge,
 the complete prevention of the latter would break the legs of commerce
 (loc. cit., 145 ff.).</p>

 If the state, by annulling such promises, should incite the people to
 violate them, it would be a frightful step towards the demoralization of
 the nation: "thus rewarding men for obtaining the property of others by
 false promises, and then, not only refusing payment, but invoking legal
 penalties on those who have helped them in their need." (<i>J. S.
 Mill</i>, Principles, V, ch. 10, 2.) Besides, the Austrian usury law of
 1803 punishes the borrower also as a spendthrift, and imprisons him for
 six months (§ 18), or else it designates where he shall make his domicile
 (<i>Ortsverweisung</i>). Modern loaning on drafts and bills of exchange,
 the acceptance of which is forged with the knowledge of the creditor,
 corresponds to what <i>Plutarch</i>, Quaest., Gr., 53, relates of the
 Cretans, who had, especially in later times, the worst possible reputation
 for avarice and dishonesty. (<i>Polyb.</i>, VI, 46. <i>Paul</i> to Titus,
 I, 12.)</p>

 He must insure him against the usury laws. (<i>Adam Smith.</i>) According
 to <i>Krug</i>, Staatsökonomie, the usury laws should be called so because
 they promote usury, not because they prevent it. Compare to some extent,

 When Catherine II. reduced the rate of interest in Livonia, in 1785, from
 6 to 5 per cent., it soon became impossible, even on the best security, to
 borrow at less than 7 per cent. (<i>Storch</i>, Handbuch, II, 26.) And so,
 when in New York, in 1717, the rate of interest was reduced to 6 per
 cent., it became necessary, the following year, to raise it again to 8 per
 cent. The merchants, themselves, petitioned that it might be so raised,
 because they found it impossible to get any loans whatever.
 (<i>Ebeling</i>, Geschichte und Erdbeschreib. von Nord Amerika, III, 152.)
 In Chili, the legal rate of interest is 6 per cent., the actual rate,
 however, never under 12 per cent., and frequently 18 to 24 per cent. In
 Peru, on the other hand, the repeal of the usury laws rapidly reduced the
 rate of interest from 50 to 24 per cent., and finally to 12.

<p class="center smaller">INTEREST-POLICY.—EFFORTS TO AVOID THE EVIL
EFFECTS OF A FIXED RATE.</p>
<p>It has been thought possible to avoid the evil effects of a fixed legal
rate of interest, by regulating it in such a way as to make it coincident
with the rate customary in the country.<a id="fnanchor_193-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_193-1">[193-1]</a> But there are numberless transactions in which an
insurance premium, or premium for risk or certain expenses of
administration<a id="fnanchor_193-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_193-2">[193-2]</a> on the part of the
loaner is inseparable from the true interest. Here, even the law which
entered most into detail could never properly provide for the infinite
gradations or shades of risk and trouble; and the rate in a great many
transactions would, therefore, be placed below the natural height. Turgot
long since observed that the value of a promise of future payment is
different not only for different persons, but at different times. Thus, for
instance, it is really less after there have been numerous cases of
bankruptcy than at other times.<a id="fnanchor_193-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_193-3">[193-3]</a> If, now, it was desired to fix the maximum rate of
interest in such a way that it should equal the rate customary in the
country, where the security is good, the best real property security for
instance, the consequence would be, that those persons who had no such
guaranty to offer (leaving the loaning "among brothers" out of the
question) would either be unable to borrow money at all, or, by evading the
law, only at an artificially higher rate. Hence the legislator causes
injury where he wished to favor. This has been observed in England in
almost all past commercial crises.<a id="fnanchor_193-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_193-4">[193-4]</a> The man who <span class="pagenum">[Pg 140]</span>
makes it his business to loan his capital, on short time and in small sums,
undertakes a trade which the examination, and the surveillance of a large
number of small debtors, and the necessity of reinvesting the many small
sums paid him, render exceedingly<a id="fnanchor_TN26"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN26">[TN 26]</a>
troublesome and disagreeable. Moreover, in loaning on short terms of
payment, there is always danger that his money may lie idle for some length
of time. These are reasons sufficient, why, in such cases, when the whole
compensation is denominated interest, a rate of interest greater than usual
in the country is equitable and even necessary. (§ 179.)<a id="fnanchor_193-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_193-5">[193-5]</a></p>
<p>It has been frequently suggested that spendthrifts and adventurers
should be hindered using, or to speak more correctly, abusing the nation's
wealth by laws prohibiting the rate of interest at which they might be
expected to obtain credit; and this in the interest alike of the creditors
they might possibly find and in their own.<a id="fnanchor_193-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_193-6">[193-6]</a> But almost every inventor of <span class="pagenum">[Pg 141]</span> genius, from Columbus to Stephenson, has
been obliged to be considered "an adventurer" for a time by "solid men."
The law limits him thus, and more especially during the critical period of
outlay which precedes the undoubted triumph of his idea, to his own means
or the gifts of others.<a id="fnanchor_193-7"></a> <a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_193-7">[193-7]</a> And how inadequate, as
rule, are both. The rich are as seldom discoverers, as discoverers are
skillful supplicants. And, as regards spendthrifts, they may ruin
themselves in so many thousands of ways, especially by buying or selling,
and unhindered by the state, that it is scarcely apparent why the one way
of borrowing should be legally closed to them.<a id="fnanchor_193-8"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_193-8">[193-8]</a> How is it, if the law itself drives them into the
hands of a worse class of creditors, and compels them to pay yet a higher
rate of interest? Are they not simply more rapidly ruined? States,
themselves, have scarcely ever given any heed to their own usury laws in
borrowing or loaning.<a id="fnanchor_193-9"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_193-9">[193-9]</a></p>

 In Austria, in 1803, in loaning on pledge, 4 per cent.; in other loans and
 in the trade of merchants with one another, 6 per cent. In France, since
 1807, with merchants, 6 per cent.; with others, 5. <i>Salmasins</i>, De
 Mono Usur., c. 1, advises that the maximum should be fixed as high as that
 usual in the most unfavorable cases. The reduction from such rate, where
 possible, would regulate itself.</p>

 How many merchants would have avoided bankruptcy here if they had been
 allowed to borrow at 8 per cent.! The established rate of 5 per cent. was
 certainly too low, considering the great demand for capital and the want
 of confidence at the moment, to permit capital to be loaned at that rate.
 Many saw themselves compelled to sell their merchandise or evidences of
 state indebtedness at a loss of 30 per cent., in order to meet their
 obligations. But the person who, to anticipate the receipts due in 6
 months, for instance, consents to suffer a loss of 30 per cent., pays, in
 a certain sense, interest at the rate of 60 per cent. a year. Compare
 <i>Tooke</i>, Considerations on the State of the Currency, 60, and History
 of Prices, II, 163, on the Crisis of 1825-26. Since the Bank, least of
 all, could exceed the legal rate of interest, numberless applications were
 made to it in times of war in order to obtain the difference between the
 legal rate and the rate usual in the country. (<i>Thornton</i>, Paper
 Credit of Great Britain, ch. 10.) Prussia, November 27, 1857, suspended
 the usury laws for 3 months, on account of the commercial crisis, except
 the provisions relating to pawn-broker and minors.</p>

<i>Turgot</i> tells of Parisian "usurers" who made weekly advances to the
 market women of la Halle, and received for 3 livres, 2 sous interest; that
 is 173 per cent. a year. The premium for insurance may have been very high
 here. When such loaners were brought before the courts, and they were
 sentenced to the galleys, the usual punishment for usury, their debtors
 came and testified their gratitude by begging for mercy to them! (Mémoire
 sur le Prêt d'Argent, § 14, 31.) Compare <i>Cantillon</i>, Nature du

<p>However, the complete repeal of the usury laws<a id="fnanchor_194-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_194-1">[194-1]
</a> has not <span class="pagenum">[Pg 142]</span> under all circumstances
accomplished what it was supposed it would; and the state should take great
care, lest by an incautious framing of its laws, it should put judges in
such a position that they may be compelled to coöperate in the execution of
immoral contracts.<a id="fnanchor_194-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_194-2">[194-2]</a> In the lowest strata,
so to speak, of the loaning business, the medieval condition continues to
exist (§ 190) after it has disappeared in the upper. Here, the loan is
effected scarcely ever for the purposes of production, but most generally
because of the most urgent necessity; and the debtor is not in a condition,
from want of education, and especially from his ignorance of arithmetic, to
estimate the magnitude of the burthen he has undertaken. The business of
loaning is, under such circumstances, considered dishonorable, to some
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 143]</span> extent, by the public. And when a
business necessary in itself is held disreputable by public opinion, the
usual result is that bad men alone engage in it.<a id="fnanchor_194-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_194-3">[194-3]
</a> Real competition which would but fix the natural price is wanting here
in proportion as the debtor is anxious for secrecy.<a id="fnanchor_194-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_194-4">[194-4]</a></p>
<p>Abuses in this respect are best guarded against by the establishment of
government loan-institutions, and by the publicity of the administration of
justice to debtors.<a id="fnanchor_194-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_194-5">[194-5]</a> Besides, every contract
might be prohibited the terms of which were such that an inexperienced

paying the debt at a proper time.<a id="fnanchor_194-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_194-6">[194-6]</a></p>
<p>Lastly, there should be a rate of legal interest fixed by the state to

which none is provided for by contract; and this rate should approximate as

 In 1787, Joseph II. abolished the penalties for usury, but allowed the
 provisions denying a legal remedy, in cases of usurious demand of over 4
 per cent. for hypothecations, 6 per cent. for bills and 5 per cent. for
 other loans, to remain. Compare the prize essay by <i>Günther</i>, Versuch
 einer vollständigen Untersuchung über Wucher und Wuchergesetze, 1790;
 <i>v. Kees</i>, über die Aufhebung der Wuchergesetze, 1791; <i>Vasco</i>,
 Usura libera, 1792. The opposite view represented by <i>Ortes</i>, E. N.,
 II, 24, and <i>v. Sonnenfels</i>, Ueber Wucher und Wuchergesetze, 1789, and
 zu Herrn <i>von Kees</i>, Abhandlung, etc., 1791. The debates on the
 repeal of the usury laws in the French Chamber of Deputies, after which
 <i>Lherbette's</i> motion in favor of their repeal was rejected. In France
 they were, during the assignat-period of bewilderment virtually, and in
 1804-1807 expressly (C. C., Art. 1907), but only provisionally repealed.
 In Würtemberg, all those having the right to draw bills of exchange were
 exempted from them in 1839. Since the law of 1848, governing bills of
 exchange, gave all persons capable of contracting, the right to draw bills
 of exchange, the usury laws have ceased to have any existence; without
 much noise before and without much complaint after. (A. Allgem. Ztg., 24
 März, 1857.) Recent complete or partial repeal of the usury laws: in
 England, in 1854; in Denmark, in 1855; in Spain, in 1856; Sardinia,

 Compare <i>F. X. Funck</i>, Zins und Wucher, 1868, a moral theological
 treatise which rightly demands a more rigid popular morality in relation
 to real usury, after the repeal of the usury laws. The recent cases in
 which courts have juridically acquitted usurers because they could not do
 otherwise, but have branded them morally, are of very questionable
 propriety, in view of the facility with which high and usurious rates of
 interest may be confounded. <i>R. Meyer</i>, Emancipationskampf, I, 78,
 advises that the capitalist be allowed to ask whatever interest he wishes,
 but that the state, as judge and executor of the laws, should enforce
 payment only at a certain rate determined by law.</p>

 Many laws seem to purposely permit this, inasmuch as they allow a rate of
 interest, higher in proportion as the position of the creditor is less
 respectable. Thus, formerly, in some places, the Jews might require higher
 interest than the Christians. Justinian allows <i>personis illustribus</i>
 only 4 per cent.; ordinary private persons, 6 per cent.; money-changers,
 etc., 8 per cent. (L. 26, Cod. IV, 32.) On the other hand, according to
 the Indian legislation of Menu, the Brahman is obliged to confine himself
 to 2, the warrior to 3, the <i>vaysya</i> to 4, the <i>sudra</i> to 5 per
 cent. per month at most. (Cap. 8.)</p>

<i>Turgot</i> considered that only the <i>prêteurs à la petite
 semaine</i>, pawnbrokers who loaned to hard-pressed people on the confines
 of the middle class and artisans, and the infamous characters who advanced
 money to the sons of rich men to spend in dissipation, still passed for
 usurers. Only the latter are injurious; not, however, because of the high
 rate of interest they charge, but because they help in a bad cause. (Sur
 le Prêt d'Argent, § 32.) According to <i>Colquhoun</i>, Police of the
 Metropolis, 167, there are women in London from whom the hucksteresses
 borrow 5 shillings every day and return them every evening with ½ shilling
 interest. Something analogous happens much more frequently in the country,
 especially in the loaning in kind of productive capital to poor persons.
 Thus, in Tessin, there are many "iron cattle" which the borrower is
 obliged to return at their original value, plus an interest of about 36
 per cent. (<i>Franscini</i>, C. Tessin, 152.) On the Rhine, frequently as
 much as 200 per cent. a year, is stipulated for in such contracts.

 establishment. Similarly, <i>Tiberius</i>, Tacit. Ann., VI, 16 seq.

 rate of interest is masked, its real rate should be expressed under
 penalty of invalidity. In addition to this, he would have those who have
 attained their majority put in full control of their fortune only after
 they had undergone an examination.</p>
<p class="footnote">It seems opportune that the old prohibition against
 interest on interest (<i>Cicero</i>, ad. Att., V, 21, and L, 26, Digest,
 XIV, 6) and the provision that the interest should not be permitted to be
 greater than the <i>alterum tantum</i> (Digest, l. c.) should be permitted
 to continue. (Digest, l. c.) Both of these measures were first decreed by
 Lucullus, for the protection of Asia Minor. Compare § 115. Florentine law,
 of 1693, that interest in arrears, or that interest on interest beyond 7
 years, should not be added to the principal without an express contract to
 that effect. (<i>Vasco</i>, Usura libera, § 155.) In England, the usury
 laws were by 2 and 3 Victor., c. 37, repealed, but only to the extent of
 excepting from their provisions bills of not over 12 months, and money
 loans not over £10. Compare <i>Rau</i>, Lehrbuch II, § 323.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><a id="S195"></a>SECTION CXCV.</p>
<p class="center smaller">THE REWARD OF ENTERPRISE.</p>
<p>The essence of an enterprise or undertaking, in the politico-economical
sense of the word, consists in this, that the undertaking party engages in
production for the purpose of commerce, at his own risk. In the earlier
stages of a nation's economy, the production of consumers is, naturally
enough, limited chiefly by their own personal wants. Somewhat later, when
the division of labor has been further developed, the workman produces at
first, enough to meet occasional determinate "orders;" and still later to
meet them regularly and as a business. Later yet, and in stages of
civilization yet higher, especially when the freedom of labor constantly
grows, as it is wont to, here, and the freedom of capital and trade becomes
more extensive, enterprise plays a part which grows more important as time
rolls on, and is usually carried on more at one's own risk.<a id="fnanchor_195-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_195-1">[195-1]</a> This transition is a great advance, inasmuch
as the advantages of the coöperation of labor and of <i>use</i> may be
utilized in a much higher degree by undertakers (<i>Unternehmer</i>) than
by producers who labor only to satisfy their own household wants, or to
meet "orders" already made. <span class="pagenum">[Pg 146]</span> The
awakening of latent wants, a matter of the utmost importance to a people
who would advance in civilization, is something which can enter into the
mind only of a man endowed with the spirit of enterprise (an undertaker).<a id="fnanchor_195-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_195-2">[195-2]</a></p>
<p>While most English political economists have confounded the personal
gain of the undertaker with the interest on the capital used by him,<a id="fnanchor_195-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_195-3">[195-3]</a> many German writers have called the
"undertaker's earnings" or profit a special, and fourth, branch of the
national income, coördinate with rent, wages, and the interest on
capital.<a id="fnanchor_195-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_195-4">[195-4]</a> Yet, the net income of
every undertaker <span class="pagenum">[Pg 147]</span> is either the fruit
of his own land used for purposes of production and of his capital, in
which case it is subject to the usual laws of development of rent and
interest; or, it must be considered as wages paid for his labor.<a id="fnanchor_195-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_195-5">[195-5]</a> These wages he earns, as a rule, by organizing
and inspecting the work, calculating the chances of the whole enterprise;
frequently by, at the same time, keeping the books and acting as cashier;
and, in the case of small undertakings, as a common fellow-workman.
(Tradesman, peasant). In every case, however, even when he <span class="pagenum">[Pg 148]</span> puts an agent paid by himself in his place,
he earns these wages from the fact that his name keeps the whole enterprise
together; and for the reason that, in the last instance,<a id="fnanchor_195-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_195-6">[195-6]</a> he has to bear the care and responsibility
attending it.<a id="fnanchor_195-7"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_195-7">[195-7]</a> When a business goes

undertaker or man of enterprise, alone; and "how productive such nights
frequently are!"<a id="fnanchor_195-8"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_195-8">[195-8]</a></p>
<p>This profit of the undertaker is subject essentially to the same natural
law as wages in general are; only it differs in this from all other
branches of income, that it can never be stipulated for in advance. Rather
does it consist of the surplus which the product of the undertaking affords
over and above all the rent stipulated for in advance or estimated at the
rate usual in the country, the interest on capital, and wages of common
labor.<a id="fnanchor_195-9"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_195-9">[195-9]</a></p>

 At first, usually imperfect enterprises in which the shop-instruments,

<i>v. Mangoldt</i>, Lehre vom Unternehmergewinn, 1855, 49 ff. The same
 author shows, in his Volkswirthschaftslehre, that it is better for the
 general good that the risk should be borne by the producer than by the
 consumer. In the case of the taking of orders, there is danger only of a
 technic failure, but in enterprise proper, there is possible also an
 economic miscarriage of the work, even when successful from a technic
 point of view. But in the case of the undertaker (man of enterprise),
 responsibility is much more of an incentive, production much more steady,
 and therefore much better able to exhaust all means of help. Consumers are
 much more certain in their steps, as regards price, etc., since they find
 what they want ready made.</p>

 Thus <i>John Stuart Mill</i>, Principles, II, ch. 15, 4, teaches with a
 certain amount of emphasis that the "gross profits of stock" are different
 not so much in the different branches in which capital is employed, as
 according to the personal capacity of the capitalist himself or of his
 agents. There are scarcely two producers who produce at precisely the same
 cost, even when their products are equal in quality, and equally cheap.
 Nor are there two who turn over their capital in precisely the same time.
 These "gross profits" uniformly fall into three classes: reward for
 abstinence, indemnity for risk, remuneration for the labor and skill
 required for superintendence. <i>Mill</i> complains that there is in
 English no expression corresponding to the French <i>profit de
 l'entrepreneur</i>. [The translator has taken the liberty to use the
 expression "undertaker's profit," for what the French call the <i>profit
 de l'entrepreneur</i>, and the Germans <i>Unternehmerlohn</i>, spite of
 its funereal associations, and because Mill himself employed it, although
 he recognized that it was not in good usage.—<span class="smcap">Tr.</span>] (II, ch. 15, 1) <i>Adam Smith</i> had the true
 doctrine in germ (Wealth of Nat., I, ch. 6), but those who came after him
 did little to develop it. Compare <i>Ricardo</i>, Principles, ch. 6. 21.
 <i>Read</i>, Political Economy, 1829, 262 ff., and <i>Senior</i>,
 Outlines, 130 seq., were the first to divide profit into two parts:
 interest-rent (<i>Zinsrente</i>) and industrial gain. Similarly,
 <i>Sismondi</i>, N. P., IV, ch. 6. According to <i>A. Walker</i>, Science
 of Wealth, 1867, 253, 285, "profits are wages received by the
 employer."</p>

 ff.; <i>Riedel</i>, Nat-Oek., II, 7 ff.; <i>von Thünen</i>, Der isolirte
 Staat, II, 1 80 ff.; <i>v. Mangoldt</i>, Unternehmergewinn, 34 ff. The
 latter divides the undertaker's profit (<i>profit de l'entrepreneur</i>)
 into the following parts:</p>
<p class="footnote">A. Indemnity for risk. If this be only an indemnity
 exactly corresponding to the risk, it cannot be looked upon at all as net
 income, but only as an indemnification for capital. If individual
 undertakers, favored by fortune, receive a much larger indemnification
 than is necessary to cover their losses, such indemnification is not
 income either, but an extraordinary profit not unlike a lottery-gain,
 unless it be called, perhaps, the reward of extraordinary courage
 (<i>Eiselen</i>), i. e., wages. If, lastly, the indemnity is uniformly
 somewhat larger than the risk, in order to compensate for the continual
 feeling that one is running a risk, it must be remembered that all
 remuneration for present sacrifice, made directly for the sake of
 production, is wont to be embraced under the name of wages.</p>
<p class="footnote">B. Wages and interest for the labor and capital
 utilized only in one's own production, and which cannot be let. <i>v.
 Mangoldt</i> himself admits, that, in the long run, only certain qualified
 labor belongs to this category.</p>
<p class="footnote">C. Undertaker's rent (<i>Unternekmerrente</i>)
 depending on the rarity of undertakers (men of enterprise) compared with
 the demand. This, therefore, is not a third component part, but only one
 which adds to the other two, <i>Storch</i>, Handbuch, I, 180, and
 <i>Rau</i>, Lehrbuch, I, § 237 ff., consider the profit of the undertaker
 as an admixture of wages and interest. Professor <i>J. Miscszewicz</i> has
 given expression to an interesting thought in opposition to myself: that
 credit is a fourth factor of production (natural forces, labor and capital
 being the other three) produced by the three older factors, as capital by
 the two oldest. The undertaker's profit he then considers the product of
 this fourth factor, corresponding to rent, interest and wages.</p>

 again into the profits of the <i>savant</i>, the undertaker and workmen,
 (<i>v. Jacob</i>, Grundsätze der Nat.-Oek., § 292; <i>Lotz</i>, Handbuch,

<i>Tantièmes</i> occupy a middle place between wages and the undertaker's
 profit; dividends a middle place between undertaker's profit and the
 interest of capital. On this is based <i>Rodbertus's</i> view, that an
 increase of joint stock companies raises <i>ceteris paribus</i> the rate
 of interest, and an increase of productive associations the rate of wages,
 for the reason that in each instance, there is some admixture of
 "undertaker's profit," or reward of enterprise.</p>

<p class="center smaller">UNDERTAKER'S PROFIT.—CIRCUMSTANCES ON WHICH
IT DEPENDS.</p>
<p>As the wages or reward of labor, in all instances, depends on the
circumstances mentioned in § 167 ff., so, also does the reward of
enterprise; in other words, the undertaker's profit or wages. It depends,
therefore:</p>
<p>A. On the rarity of the personal qualities required in a business, which
qualities may be divided into technical and ethical qualities. Among the
latter are, especially, the capacity to inspire capitalists with confidence
and workmen with love for their task; the administrative talent to
systematize a great whole made up of men and to order it properly, to keep
it together by sternness of discipline in which pedantry has no part, and
by economy with no admixture of avarice; and frequently endurance and even
presence of mind. These ethical, statesmanlike qualities are, take them all
in all, a more indispensable condition of high undertaker's profit than the
technical are.<a id="fnanchor_196-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_196-1">[196-1]</a></p>
<p>B. On the risk of the undertaking in which not only one's property, but
one's reputation, may be lost.<a id="fnanchor_196-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_196-2">[196-2]</a>
</p>
<p>C. As to the disagreeableness of the undertaking or enterprise, we must
take into especial consideration the disinclination of capitalists in
general to assume the care and trouble of concerning themselves directly
with the employment of their capital. (§ 183.) The undertaker's profit is,
besides, lower in proportion as he needs to care less for the profitable
application <span class="pagenum">[Pg 150]</span> of the different sources
of production, and for their preservation. Hence it is, in general, higher
for the direction of circulating than of fixed capital; in speculative
trade and in wholesale trade which extends to the whole world, than in
retail trade and merely local business.<a id="fnanchor_196-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_196-3">[196-3]</a></p>
<p>It has, indeed, been remarked, that the undertaker's profit is, as a
rule, proportioned to the capital employed.<a id="fnanchor_196-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_196-4">[196-4]</a> This may be true in most cases, but only as the
accidental compromise between opposing forces. It is evident that the
greater the enterprise is, the greater may be the surplus over and above
the compensation stipulated for in advance of all the coöperating
productive forces, and not only absolutely but also relatively. We need
only call to mind the successful results attending the greater division of
labor (§ 66) and the greater division of use (<i>Gebrauchstheilung</i>) (§
207); the greater facility of using remains in production on a large scale,
and the fact that all purchases, and all obtaining of capital are made,
when the items are large, at cheaper rates, because of the more convenient
conducting of the business.</p>
<p>This is true up to the point where the magnitude of the whole becomes so
great as to render the conducting of it difficult. Considered even
subjectively, the great undertaker, whose name and responsibility keep a
great many productive forces together, may demand a higher reward, because
there are so few persons competent to do the same. On the other hand, it
cannot be denied that a support in keeping with his position may be called
the amount of the cost of production of the undertaker's labor. If this
cost is once fixed by custom, it will, of course, be relatively high in
those branches of business which permit only of the employment of a small
capital.<a id="fnanchor_196-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_196-5">[196-5]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 151]</span>In the higher stages of
civilization, the undertaker's profit has, like the rate of interest, a
tendency to decline. This decline is, indeed, in part, only an apparent
one, caused by the decreased risk and the smaller indemnity-premium. But it
is, in part, a real one, produced by the increased competition of
undertakers.<a id="fnanchor_196-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_196-6">[196-6]</a> The more intelligent
landowners and workmen <span class="pagenum">[Pg 152]</span> become, the
more readily do they acquire the capacity and desire to use the productive
forces peculiar to them in undertakings of their own; and the number of
retired persons who live from their rents grows smaller with the decline of
the rate of interest. The strong competition of undertakers now leads to
degeneration, and undertakings or enterprises become usual in which the
gains or losses are subjective, and are destitute of all
politico-economical productiveness; for instance, the purchase of growing
fruits, and businesses carried on in "margins," or differences. It is
self-evident that the circumstances which retard the rate of interest, or
turn it retrograde, would have a similar effect on the undertaker's profit.
(§ 186.) On the whole, a rapidly growing people meet with great gains and
losses, but the preponderance is in favor of the former. A stationary
people are wont to become more and more careful and cautious. A declining
people underestimate the chances of loss, although in their case they tend
more and more to preponderate over the chances of gain. (<i>v.
Mangoldt.</i>)</p>

 much as taken root; that from 50 to 60 vegetate for a time in continual
 danger of failing altogether, and that, at the furthest, 10 succeed well,
 but scarcely with an enduring success. (Enquête commerciale de 1834, II,

 According to <i>Sinclair</i>, Grundgesetze des Ackerbaues, 1821, the
 profit on capital of English farmers was wont to be from 10 to 18 per
 cent. Only in very remarkable cases, by persons in very favorable
 circumstances, was from 15 to 20 per cent. earned; that is, on the whole,
 less than in commerce and industry. In the case of farmers of meadow land,
 15 per cent. and even more was not unusual; because there is a need of
 less outlay here, but more mercantile speculation, especially in the
 fattening of live stock.</p>
<p class="footnote">At the end of the last century English farmers
 expected 10 per cent. profit on their capital. (<i>A. Young</i>, View of
 the Agriculture of Suffolk, 1797, 25.) And so <i>Senior</i> is of opinion
 that, in the England of to-day, industrial enterprises of £100,000 yield a
 profit of less than 10 per cent. a year; those of £40,000, at least 12½
 per cent.; those of from £10,000 to £20,000, 15 per cent.; smaller ones 20
 per cent. and even more. He makes mention of fruit hucksters who earned
 over 20 per cent. a day; that is, over 7,000 per cent. a year! (Outlines,
 203 seq.) In Manchester, manufacturers, according to the same authority,
 turned over their capital twice a year at 5 per cent.; retail dealers,
 three times a year at 3½ per cent. (Ibid, 143.) <i>Torrens</i>, The Budget
 (1844), 108, designates 7 per cent. as the minimum profit which would
 induce an English capitalist to engage in an enterprise of his own.
 According to <i>v. Viebahn</i>, Statistik des Regierungsbezirks
 Düsseldorf, 836, I, 180, the undertaker's profit, i. e., the surplus money
 of the value of the manufactured articles, after deduction made of the raw
 material and wages, in the Berg country, amounted to, in 81 iron
 factories, 146,400 thalers; in 6 cotton factories, to 21,200 thalers; in
 15 cloth factories, to 14,725 thalers; in 4 worsted factories, to 1,700
 thalers; in 4 brush factories, to 800 thalers; in 2 tobacco factories to
 10,220 thalers; in 2 paper factories, to 7,400 thalers; on an average,
 1,924 thalers; although many undertakers earned only from 200 to 400
 thalers, and some few from 5,000 to 10,000 thalers.</p>

 This is, of course somewhat oppressive to many individuals, and hence we
 find that in those countries which are unquestionably making great
 advances in civilization, there are so many complaints of alleged growing
 impoverishment. Compare <i>Sam. Fortrey</i>, England's Interest and
 Improvement, 1663; <i>R. Coke</i>, A Treatise wherein is demonstrated that
 the Church and State of England are in equal danger with the Trade of it,
 1671. Britania languens, showing the Grounds and Reasons of the Increase
 and Decay of Land, etc., 1680. And per contra, England's great Happiness,
 wherein is demonstrated that a great Part of our Complaints are causeless,

 of almost any number of opinions advanced during the last thirty
 years.</p>

<p class="center smaller">UNDERTAKER'S PROFIT.—HAVING THE "LEAD."</p>
<p>The undertaker's profit is that branch of the national income in which
the greater number of new fortunes are made. If a landowner has a large
income, he generally considers himself obliged to make a correspondingly
large outlay, one in keeping with his position; and workmen who are not
undertakers themselves seldom have the means to make large savings.
Besides, undertakers stand between the purchasers of their products and the
lessors of the productive forces used by them in the peculiarly favorable
situation which I may describe by the expression: having, as they say in
card-playing, "the lead."<a id="fnanchor_196a-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_196a-1">[196a-1]</a> When, in the struggle for prices, one party
occupies <span class="pagenum">[Pg 153]</span> a position which enables him
to observe every change of circumstance much sooner than his opponent, the
latter may always suffer from the effects of erroneous prices. If, for
instance, the productiveness of business increases, even without any
personal merit of the individual undertakers themselves, it will always be
some time before the decline in the price of commodities and the rise in
the rate of interest take place, as a result of the increased competition
of undertakers, consequent upon the extraordinary rate of the undertaker's
profit. It is difficult, and even impossible in most instances for the
proprietors of the productive forces which they have rented out, to
immediately estimate accurately the profit made by undertakers. On the
other hand, the least enhancement of the price of the forces of production
is immediately felt by the undertakers, and causes them to raise their
prices. They just as quickly observe a decline of the prices of the
commodities, and know how to make others bear it by lowering wages and the
rate of interest.<a id="fnanchor_196a-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_196a-2">[196a-2]</a> It should not be
forgotten that the persons most expert, far-seeing, active and expeditious

 This is much less the case in rents, for the reason that contracts here
 are made for a much longer term. Hence, here the farmer has as much to
 fear as to hope from a change of circumstances. Hence, too, we meet with a

 If an undertaker can cede his higher reward to another and guaranty its
 continuance, the circumstances which enable him to do this assume the
 nature of fixed capital; for instance, the trade or <i>clientèle</i>
 secured by custom or privilege. If the undertaker has not the power to
 dispose of it in this way, the increased profit either disappears with his
 retirement from the business or falls to the owner of the capital
 employed, and still more to the land owner. Thus, for instance, how
 frequently it has happened that a store, which has been largely resorted
 to by the public, drawn thither by the business tact of the lessee, has
 afterwards been rented by the owner at a higher rent! (<i>Hermann</i>,
 loc. cit. 210.)</p>

<a href="#fnanchor_196a-4" class="pginternal">[196a-4]</a>
<i>Lassalle's</i> socialistic attacks on Political Economy have been
 directed mainly against the undertaker's profit or reward. Compare the
 work "Bastiat-Schulze von Delitzsch, der ökonom. Julian oder Kapital und
 Arbeit," 1863. By means of state credit, he would have this branch of
 income turned over to common labor. <i>Dühring</i> also, Kapital und
 Arbeit 90, declaims not so much against capital as against "the absolutism
 of undertakers." <i>Schäffle</i> D. Vierteljahrsschrift Nr. 106, II, 223,
 objects to this, that undertakers give value in exchange to unfinished
 products, a great service rendered even to the laboring class, who
 otherwise would have to resign the advantages of the division of
 labor.</p>
<p class="footnote">The undertaker's profit is precisely the part of the
 great politico-economical tree from which further growth chiefly takes
 place. To artificially arrest it, therefore, would be to hasten the
 stationary state, and thus make general and greater the pressure on
 workmen and capitalists, which it is sought to remove locally. Hence
 <i>Roesler</i>, Grundsätze, 507 ff., very appropriately calls the
 undertaker's profit the premium paid by society to those who most
 effectually combat the "law of rent." The importance of a good undertaker
 may be clearly seen when a joint stock manufacturing company pays a
 dividend of from 20 to 30 per cent., while one close by, of the same kind,
 produces no profit whatever. But, at the same time, the socialistic hatred
 of this branch of income may be easily accounted for, in a time full of
 stock-jobbing, which last never produces except a pseudo-undertaker's
 profit.</p>

THE THREE BRANCHES OF INCOME.</h3>
<p class="p2 center"><a id="S197"></a>SECTION CXCVII.</p>
<p class="center smaller">INFLUENCE OF THE BRANCHES OF INCOME ON THE PRICE
OF COMMODITIES.</p>
<p>We have seen, § 106, that the cost of production of a commodity,
considered from the point of view of individual economy, may be reduced to
the payment for the use of the requisite productive forces rented or loaned
to the producer. Hence every great variation in the relation of the three
branches of income to one another must produce a corresponding <span class="pagenum">[Pg 155]</span> variation in the price of commodities.<a id="fnanchor_197-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_197-1">[197-1]</a> When, for instance, the rate of wages
increases because they absorb a larger part of the national income, those
commodities in the production of which human labor, directly employed, is
the chief factor, must become dearer as compared with others. Whether this
difference shall be felt principally by the products of nature or of
capital (compare § 46 seq.), depends on the causes which brought about the
enhancement of the rate of wages. Thus, a large decrease of population, or
emigration on a large scale, will usually lower rent as well as the rate of
interest;<a id="fnanchor_197-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_197-2">[197-2]</a> an extraordinary
improvement made in the art of agriculture, only the former; and an
extraordinary increase of capital, only the latter. The usual course of
things, namely that the growth of population necessitates a heavier draft
on the resources of the soil, and thus causes rents to go up, and makes
labor dear, must have the effect of raising the price of the products of
labor and of natural forces, as compared with the products of capital; and
all the more as it causes the rate of interest to suffer a positive
decline. The products of mechanical labor become relatively cheaper; and
cheaper in proportion as the producing machinery is more durable; therefore
in proportion as, in the price of the services it renders, mere interest
preponderates over compensation for its wear and tear.<a id="fnanchor_197-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_197-3">[197-3]</a></p> <p><span class="pagenum">[Pg

<p>Let us, for a moment, leave ground-rent out of the question entirely,
and suppose a nation's economy whose production is conducted by eleven
undertakers employed on different commodities. Let us suppose that
undertaker No. 1 uses machinery exclusively and employs only as many
workmen as are strictly necessary to look after it, that undertaker No. 2
has a somewhat larger number of workmen and a somewhat smaller amount of
fixed capital, etc.; and that this increase in the number of workmen and
decrease in the amount of fixed capital continues until we reach undertaker
No. 11, who employs all his capital in the payment of wages. If now, the
rate of wages were to rise, and the interest on capital to fall in the same
proportion, the commodities produced by undertaker No. 11 would rise most
in price, and those of No. 1 decline most. In the case of undertaker No. 6,
the opposing influences would probably balance each other, and if the
producers of money belonged to this sixth class, it would be very easy to
get a view of the whole change in the circumstances of production, in the
money-price of the different commodities.<a id="fnanchor_197-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_197-4">[197-4]</a></p>

 Compare <i>Adam Smith</i>, I, ch. 7, fin. This relative increase or
 decrease of one branch of income at the expense or to the advantage of
 another, should be distinguished from the absolute change of its amount
 which does not affect the cost of production. Thus, for instance, when the
 rent of land indeed increases, but in consequence of a simultaneous
 improvement in agriculture, a decline in the rate of interest, and an
 enhancement of the price of wheat is avoided (§ 157). So, too, when
 individual wages increase on account of the greater skill and energy of
 labor, but the same quantity and quality of labor do not become dearer (§
 172 seq.); and lastly, when the rate of interest remaining unaltered, the
 receipts of capitalists are increased by reason of an increase of their
 capital (§ 185).</p>

 the foregoing, although the great abstractness and hypothetical nature of
 his conclusions might easily lead the reader astray. The proposition which
 closes the second part, and which has been so frequently misunderstood by

<p class="center smaller">REMEDY IN CASE ONE FACTOR OF PRODUCTION HAS
BECOME DEARER.</p>
<p>When one of the three branches of income has grown as compared with the
others; in other words, when the factor of production which it represents
has become relatively dearer, it is to the interest of the undertaker and
of the public, that it should be replaced where possible by another and
cheaper productive force. (§ 47.) On this depends the advantageousness of
<i>intensive</i> agriculture (high farming) in every higher stage of
civilization. There land is dear and labor cheap. Hence, efforts are made
to get along with the least amount of land-surface, and this minimum of
land is made more productive by a number of expedients in cultivation, by
manuring it, by seed-corn, etc., of course also by the employment of
journeymen laborers, oxen, etc. And since the price of land is intimately
connected with the price of most raw material, remains are here saved as
much as possible, often with a great deal of trouble.<a id="fnanchor_198-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_198-1">[198-1]</a> In a lower stage of civilization, such savings
would be considered extravagance. As land is here cheap, and capital dear,
it is necessary to carry on the cultivation of land <i>extensively</i>;
that is, save in capital and labor, and allow the factor nature to perform
the most possible. The clearing up of untilled land, or the draining of
swampy land etc., would be frequently injurious here; for it would require
the use of a very large amount of capital to obtain land of comparatively
little value.</p>
<p>In large cities, it is customary to build houses high in proportion to
the dearness of the land.<a id="fnanchor_198-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_198-2">[198-2]</a> Thus, in England, where <span class="pagenum">[Pg

supplanted by capital. In countries like the East Indies or China, the
reverse is the case. I need only call attention to the palanquins used in

eighteen hundred steps to the smelting furnaces,<a id="fnanchor_198-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_198-3">[198-3]</a> and, on the other hand, to the "elevators," so much

<p class="center smaller">INFLUENCE OF FOREIGN TRADE.</p>
<p>Foreign trade, that great means of coöperation of labor among different
nations, affords such a remedy in a very special manner. It very frequently
happens that the undertakers of one country, when a certain factor of
production seems too dear at home, borrow it elsewhere. Thus, for instance,
a country with a high rate of wages draws on another for labor, and one
with a high rate of interest on another for capital.<a id="fnanchor_199-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_199-1">[199-1]
</a> We elsewhere consider such a course of things from the standpoint of
the supplying country, which in this way is healed of a heavy plethora of
some single factor of production which disturbs the harmony of the whole.
(§§ 187, 259, ff.). But, at the same time, the supplied country, considered
from a <span class="pagenum">[Pg 159]</span> purely economic point of view,
reaps decided advantages therefrom. If, for instance, a Swiss confectioner
returns from Saint Petersburgh to his home, after having made a fortune in
an honest way, no one can say that Russia has grown poorer by the amount of
that fortune. This man made his own capital; if he were to remain in
Russia, its national economy would be richer than before his immigration
thither. Now, it is, at least, no poorer, and has in the meantime had the
advantage of the more skilled labor of the foreigner.<a id="fnanchor_199-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_199-2">[199-2]
</a> And, so, when a capitalist living in Germany purchases Hungarian land,
the national income of Hungary is diminished by the amount of the annual
rent which now goes to Germany; but it receives an equal amount in the
interest on capital, provided the purchase was an honorable one and the
capital given in exchange for the land honestly invested.<a id="fnanchor_199-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_199-3">[199-3]</a> If Hungary, in general, had a superabundance
of land but a lack of capital, the economic advantage is undoubted.<a id="fnanchor_199-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_199-4">[199-4]</a></p>
<p>These economic rules, indeed, are applicable only to the extent <span class="pagenum">[Pg 160]</span> that higher and national considerations do
not in the interest of all, create exceptions to them. "Is not the life
more than meat, and the body than raiment?" No rational people will allow
certain services to be performed for them preponderantly by foreigners,
even when they can be performed cheaper by the latter—the services of
religion, of the army, of the state, etc. The same is true of
landownership; and all the truer in proportion as political and legal
rights of presentation and other forms of patronage are attached to it.
Lastly, hypothecation-debts which go beyond certain limits, may entail the
same consequences as the complete alienation of the land;<a id="fnanchor_199-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_199-5">[199-5]</a> and Raynal may have been, under certain
circumstances, right when he said, that to admit foreigners to subscribe to
the national debt was equivalent to ceding a province to them.<a id="fnanchor_199-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_199-6">[199-6]</a> It is obvious that a great power may do much

 The older political economists have, as a rule, ignored this law, and were
 wont to consider every payment of money to a foreign country as injurious.
 Thus, for instance, <i>Culpeper</i>, Tract against the high Rate of Usury,
 1623, 1640, disapproves all loans made from foreign countries, because
 they draw more money in interest, and in repayment of the principal out of
 the nation, than they brought into it at first; and all the more, as the
 loan is generally procured, not in the precious metals, but in foreign
 goods, of which there is a superabundance in the home country. Similarly
 <i>Child</i>, Discourse of Trade, 1690, 79, who claims that the creditor
 was always fattened at the expense of the debtor. Hence <i>v.
 Schröder</i>, Fürst, Schatz- und Rentkammar, 141, advises that the capital
 borrowed in foreign countries should be confiscated. Compare, also, <i>v.
 Justi</i>, Staatswirthschaft, II, 461. And yet the very simplest
 calculation shows, that if a man borrows $1,000 at 5 per cent. and makes
 10, he is doing a good business with the borrowed capital. This
 <i>Locke</i>, Considerations, 9, recognizes very clearly. Compare, also,
 <i>J. B. Say</i>, Traité, II, ch. 10, and <i>Hermann</i>, Staatsw.

 Think of the English creditors in Portugal and the Genoese in Corsica

 demonstrates that England should recruit her army from Ireland, where
 wages are so much lower than in Great Britain. But how dangerous in a
 political sense! In 1832, one-fourth of the stock of the United States
 Bank was in the hands of foreigners, and hence its opponents nick-named it
 the "British Bank." By the rules of the principal bank in Philadelphia, in
 1836, only American citizens were allowed a vote in its proceedings.
 Similarly in the case of the Bank of France. (<i>M. Chevalier</i>, Lettres
 sur l'Amerique du N. I, 364.) It may be remarked in general, that the

 economic principles, while the more modern ignore them entirely.</p>

<p class="center smaller">INFLUENCE OF THE BRANCHES OF INCOME ON THE PRICE
OF COMMODITIES.</p>
<p>In relation to foreign trade, in the narrowest sense of the term, fears
were formerly very frequently expressed and are sometimes even now, which
in the last analysis are based on the assumption that one country might be
underbid by another in all branches of commodities.<a id="fnanchor_200-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_200-1">[200-1]</a> This is evidently absurd. Whoever wants to pay for
foreign commodities can do it only in goods of his own. When he pays for
them with money, the money is either the immediate product of his own
husbandry (mining countries!), or the mediate product obtained by the
previous surrender of products of his own. To receive from foreign
countries all the objects which one has need of, would be to receive them
as a gift.</p>
<p>It is just as absurd to fear that the three branches of income in the
same country's economy should be all relatively high at the same time, and
competition with foreign countries be thus made more difficult. Rent and
interest especially in this respect have to demean themselves in ways
diametrically opposed to each other.<a id="fnanchor_200-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_200-2">[200-2]</a> When trade is entirely free, every nation will
engage at last in those branches of production which require chiefly the
productive forces which are cheapest in that country; that is which the
relatively low level of the corresponding branch of income recommends to
individual economy and enterprise. The merely absolute and personal height
of the three branches of income has, as we have <span class="pagenum">[Pg
162]</span> said, no direct influence on the price of commodities. In this
respect, all these may be higher in one country than in another. Thus, for
instance, English landowners, capitalists and workmen may be all at the
same time in a better economic condition respectively than Polish
landowners, capitalists and workmen, when the national income of England
stands to its area and population in general, in a much more favorable

 We very frequently hear that countries with high wages must be outflanked
 in a neutral market by countries with a low rate of wages.
 <i>Ricardo's</i> disciples reject this, because a decrease in the profit
 would put the undertaker in a condition to bear the loss caused by the
 high wages paid. See Report of the Select Committee on Artisans and
 Machinery. <i>Senior</i> ridicules such reasoning very appropriately by
 inquiring: "Might not the loss enable him to bear the loss?" Outlines,
 146. And so <i>J. B. Say</i> thinks that wages are always lowest when
 undertakers are earning nothing. The truth is rather this: a country with
 a relatively high rate of wages cannot, in a neutral market, offer those
 commodities the chief factors required for the production of which is
 labor; but the comparatively low rate of interest or low rents, or the
 lowness of both found in connection therewith, must fit it to produce
 other commodities very advantageously. If, therefore, the rate of wages
 rises, the result will be to divert production and exports into other
 channels than those in which they have hitherto flowed. The old complaint
 of Saxon agriculturists, that there is a lack of labor in the country, is
 certainly very surprising in a nation as thickly populated as Saxony. But
 the remedy proposed by the most experienced practitioners consists chiefly
 in a higher rate of wages to enable workmen to care for themselves in old
 age, the introduction of the piece-work system and an increase of
 agricultural machines. But it seems to me, that the whole situation there
 points to the advantage of in part limiting the large farming hitherto
 practiced to live-stock raising and other branches in which labor may be
 spared, and in part of replacing it, by small farming of plants which are
 objects of trade.</p>

and outflow! Even "idle" capitalists have this of good, that, without them,

 only forms of loan. (<i>Endemann</i> in <i>Hildebrand's</i> Jahrb., 1863,

 <i>Sismondi</i> thinks that land and the capital employed in its

would not, at least at the beginning, have to fight English capital.<a id="fnanchor_202-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_202-2">[202-2]</a> Where the treasure is, the heart is also! The
land alone is immovable. It alone cannot be withdrawn from the pressure of
taxation or from the distress of war. It alone cannot flee into foreign
parts.<a id="fnanchor_202-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_202-3">[202-3]</a> <a id="fnanchor_202-4"></a> <a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_202-4">[202-4]</a> At the same time, it cannot be denied that the
possibility <span class="pagenum">[Pg 166]</span> of being able to carry
one's fortune out of a country in one's pocketbook and to be able to
procure there with one's money the same conveniences, customs, etc., to
which one was accustomed at home, is, under certain circumstances, an
important element of political and religious freedom. Moreover, the bright
side and the dark of every class of owners, especially the dread of all
unnecessary and also of all necessary change, must be common to rent and
interest. Hence, where there is a marked and well-defined separation of the
branches of income, it will be always considered a difficult but
unavoidable problem, how to enable mere labor to take an active part in the
affairs of the state.<a id="fnanchor_202-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_202-5">[202-5]</a></p>
<p>In times when calm prevails (not, however, in transition-crises such as
are referred to in § 24), there is a public opinion concerning merit and
reward, we might say a public conscience, by which a definite relation of
the three branches of income to one another is declared equitable. Every
"fair-minded man" feels satisfied when this relation is realized, and this
feeling of satisfaction is one of the principal conditions precedent to the
prosperity of production; inasmuch as upon it depends the participation
(<i>Theilnahme</i>) of all owners of funds and forces. Every deviation from
this relation or proportion is, of course, a misfortune,<a id="fnanchor_202-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_202-6">[202-6]</a> but never so great as <span class="pagenum">[Pg
167]</span> when it takes place at the expense of the wages of labor. It
should never be forgotten that rent is an appropriation of the gifts of
nature, and that interest is a further fruit obtained by frugality from
older labor already remunerated. Besides, the rate of wages when high,
generally adds to the efficiency of labor, which cannot be claimed for
interest or rent.<a id="fnanchor_202-7"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_202-7">[202-7]</a> The best means to
preserve the harmony of the three branches of income is, however, universal
activity. "Rich or poor, strong or weak, the idler is a knave." (<i>J. J.
Rousseau.</i>)</p>

 The contrast between <i>Adam Smith</i>, at the end of the first book, and
 <i>Ricardo</i>, ch. 24, in regard to this point, is very characteristic of
 the times of those two authors. According to <i>Smith</i>, the private
 interests of the landowners and laborers run entirely parallel; only both
 classes are easily deceived as to their own interests. Capitalists
 understand their own interest very well, and represent it with great
 energy; but their interest is in opposition to the common good, in so far
 as their profit among a poor and declining people is higher than among a
 rich and flourishing one. <i>Ricardo</i>, on the other hand, thinks that
 the interest of the landowners is opposed to that of all others for the
 reason that they desire that the cost of the production of wheat etc.
 should be as high as possible.</p>
<p class="footnote">Related to this is the fact that, in <i>Adam
 Smith's</i> time, the new theory of rent remained almost unnoticed, but
 that after 1815, it became rapidly popular. In a similar way, the
 socialists of the present time are wont to charge the undertaking class
 with opposing their own interests to those of the whole people, meaning by
 the whole the majority. (§ 196 a.)</p>

 Hence it is, that in so many constitutions, charters of cities, etc., the
 exercise of the higher rights of citizenship is conditioned by the
 possession of a certain quantity of land, and that landownership is
 considered as a species of public function.</p>
<p class="footnote">I read, a short time ago, the life of a North-German
 noblemen who, in 1813, had fought bravely against the French, "although he
 was a man of large estates, and the enemy might therefore very easily have
 laid hands on them." If this "although" of his eulogist expressed the
 actual feeling of large landed proprietors, a great many old political
 institutions would have lost all foundation.</p>

<h3>DISTRIBUTION OF NATIONAL INCOME.</h3>
<p class="p2 center"><a id="S203"></a>SECTION CCIII.</p>
<p class="center smaller">EFFECT OF AN EQUAL DIVISION OF THE NATIONAL
INCOME.</p>
<p>The best distribution of the national income among a people is that
which enables them to enjoy the greatest amount and variety of real goods,
and permanently to produce real goods in an increasing quantity and
variety.</p>
<p>If the income of a people were divided equally among all, each one would
indeed, be, to a very great extent, independent of all others. But then, no
one would care to devote himself to the coarser and less agreeable
occupations, and these would be either entirely neglected, or people would
have to take turns in engaging in them.<a id="fnanchor_203-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_203-1">[203-1]</a> (§ 9.) And thus would disappear one of the chief
advantages of the division of labor, viz: that the higher orders of talent
are devoted to the higher orders of labor. Besides, it is very doubtful,
whether, under such circumstances, there would still be any solvent
(<i>zahlungsfähige</i>) demand for the achievements of art.</p>
<p>Nor would the saving of capital prosper, where such equality prevailed.
Most men consider the average outlay of their equals as an unavoidable
want, and save only to the extent <span class="pagenum">[Pg 169]</span>
that they possess more than others of their class. If, therefore, every one
had an equal income, no one would consider himself in a condition to
save.<a id="fnanchor_203-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_203-2">[203-2]</a> The same consideration would
deter most men from every economic venture, and yet no great progress is

 According to <i>Schäffle</i>, System, II, 379 ff., "the distribution of
 the social return of production which conduces to the attainment of the
 highest measure of civilization in the moral association of men and in all
 the grades of that association, and thereby to the satisfaction of all
 true human wants in the highest degree." Thus only can a satisfactory line
 of demarkation be drawn between the profit of capital and the wages of
 labor (384).</p>

 The essential characteristic of the desert is, according to <i>Ritter</i>,
 Erdkunde, I, 1019 seq., its uniformity. No break in the horizontal plain,
 and hence no condensation of atmospheric vapor into bodies of water of any
 considerable size. The composition of the soil is everywhere the same;
 nothing but masses of silex and salt, hard and sharp. Lastly, extreme
 mobility of the surface, which undulates with every wind, so that no plant
 can take root in it. Nearly every feature in this picture finds its
 analogon in the extreme political and economic equality of men.</p>

 développement.</i> (<i>Dunoyer</i>, Liberté du Travail, IV, 9, 10.) But,
 indeed, the rich man should never forget that society "inasmuch as it
 permits the concentration of wealth in his hands, expects that he will
 employ it to better advantage than the mass of mankind would if that same
 wealth were equally divided among them." (<i>Brentano.</i>)</p>
<p class="p2 center"><a id="S204"></a>SECTION CCIV.</p>
<p class="center smaller">DISTRIBUTION OF NATIONAL INCOME.—MONEYED
ARISTOCRACIES AND PAUPERISM.</p>
<p>The extreme opposite of this, when the middle class disappears and the
whole nation falls into a few over-rich men and numberless proletarians, we
call the oligarchy of money, with pauperism as the reverse of the medal.
Such a social condition has all the hardship of an aristocracy without its
palliatives. As it is, as a rule, the offspring of a degenerated
democracy,<a id="fnanchor_204-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_204-1">[204-1]</a> it cannot in form depart too
widely from the principle <span class="pagenum">[Pg 170]</span> of
equality. Only get rich, they cry to the famishing poor; the law puts no
obstacle in your way, and you shall immediately share our position.<a id="fnanchor_204-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_204-2">[204-2]</a> Here the uniformity and centralization of the
state, which are an abomination in the eyes of genuine aristocracy, are
carried to the extreme. Capital takes the place of men, and is valued more
than men. All life is made to depend on the state, that its masters, the
great money-men, may control it as they will. The falling away of all
restrictions on trade, and of all uncommercial considerations relating to
persons and circumstances, gives full play to capital, and speculators seek
to win all that can be won. And, indeed, all colossal fortunes are
generally made at the expense of others, either with the assistance of the
state-power or by speculation in the fluctuations of values.<a id="fnanchor_204-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_204-3">[204-3]</a> The dependence of proletarians on others is
here all the greater, because from a complete absence of capital and land,
so far as they are concerned, they are compelled, uninterruptedly, to carry
their entire labor-force to market; and also because the supply of labor is
made in masses embracing a large number of individuals, while the demand
for labor lies in the hands of very few, and may be very readily and
systematically concentrated.<a id="fnanchor_204-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_204-4">[204-4]</a> So great and one-sided a dependence is, for men too
far removed from one another for real mutual love, doubtless one of the
greatest of moral temptations. It is as easy a matter for the hopelessly
poor to hate the law, as it is for the over-rich to despise it.<a id="fnanchor_204-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_204-5">[204-5]</a> Under such circumstances, the contagious power
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 171]</span> of communism, the dangers of which to
order and freedom we have treated of in § So, is great. There is a dreadful
lesson in the fact of history, that six individuals owned one-half of the
province of Africa, <i>when Nero had them put to death</i>!<a id="fnanchor_204-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_204-6">[204-6]</a> Externally, a moneyed oligarchy will always be
a weak state. The great majority who have nothing to lose take little
interest in the perpetuation of its political independence. They rather
rejoice at the downfall of their oppressors hitherto, and are cheered by
the hope of obtaining a part of the general plunder.<a id="fnanchor_204-7"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_204-7">[204-7]</a> The rich, too, separated from the neglected
and propertyless masses of the nation, and rightly distrustful of them,
begin to forget their nationality, and to balance its advantages against
the sacrifices necessary to preserve it. But, a merely materialistic
calculation leads doubtless to the conclusion, that universal empire is the
most rational form of the state. The world-sovereignty of Rome was, by no
circumstance more promoted than by the struggles between the rich and the
poor, which devastated the <i>orbis terrarum</i>, and in which the Romans
generally sided with the property classes.<a id="fnanchor_204-8"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_204-8">[204-8]</a> <a id="fnanchor_204-9"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_204-9">[204-9]</a> <a id="fnanchor_204-10"></a>

 making political rights dependent on the possession of a certain amount of
 property is certainly a means of promoting equality. Hence, therefore, a
 reconciliation between the differences of class created by birth, may be
 effected for a long time here.</p>

 law of nature becomes most apparent when one compares the preponderating

 The spirit of the Grecian moneyed oligarchy is best revealed by
 <i>Plato</i>, De Republ., VIII, and <i>Aristotle</i>, Polit., III, VI,
 passim, the first of whom considers the contrast between rich and poor as
 in itself demoralizing (IV, 422). All that can be called by the name of
 tradition, the political faith of a people, and the national feeling of
 right, had, in the Grecian world, been transformed into mere reasoning and
 concerned itself, with frightful exclusiveness, to the contrast existing
 between rich and poor. Compare <i>Aristot.</i>, Pol., II, 4, 1, with
 <i>Droysen</i>, Gesch. des Hellenismus, II, 496 etc., and the citations
 from <i>Menander</i> in <i>Stob.</i>, Serm., LXXXIX, 503, in which gold
 and silver are proclaimed almighty. It is a remarkable proof of the
 <i>omne venalia esse</i> in Greece that <i>Thucydides</i> (II, 65) lauds
 even <i>Pericles</i>, especially for his incorruptibility.
 <i>Demosthenes</i> says of his contemporaries, that it excited envy when
 any one was bribed, laughter when he confessed it; that he who was
 convicted of it (bribery) was pardoned, and he who blamed it, hated.
 (Phil., II, 121.) Compare the list in <i>Demosth.</i>, Pro. Cor., 324;
 <i>Pausan</i>, III, 10. In Athens, on the occasion of the
 census-constitution imposed forcibly on the state by <i>Antipater</i>,
 that in a population of 21,000 citizens, only 9,000 had a property worth
 2,000 drachmas or more, that is, enough for a man to live on in the most
 niggardly way, on the highest interest it would yield. If, in addition to
 this, account be taken of the large number of slaves, the small number of
 the property class is all the more surprising, inasmuch as Lycurgus'
 financial administration bears evidence that the people were in a
 flourishing and comfortable condition; that afterwards, peace for the most
 part prevailed, and that Alexander's victories enabled Grecian commerce to
 make large gains. Compare <i>Boeckh</i>, Staatsh. IV, 3, 9.</p>
<p class="footnote">In Sparta, the governing class finally numbered only
 700 families, 100 of which owned all the land, and 600 of which were,
 therefore, only noble proletarians. It is well known that the social
 attempts at reform by Agis and Kleomenes only precipitated the downfall of
 the state. (<i>Plutarch</i>, Agis and Kleomenes.) <i>Aratos</i> owed a
 great part of the consideration in which he was held to the reputation
 which he obtained by protecting the property of the Sicyonian exiles
 (<i>Thirlwall</i>, History of Greece, VIII, 167), while on the other hand,
 men like <i>Agathocles and Nabis</i> supported their faction by
 persecution of the rich, new debtor-laws and new division of land.
 (<i>Polyb.</i>, XIII, 6, XVI, 13, XVII, 17, XXVI, 2; <i>Livy</i>, XXXII,
 38, 40, XXXIV, 31, XXXVIII, 34; <i>Plutarch</i>, Cleom, 20.) <i>Livy</i>
 expressly says that all the <i>optimates</i> were in favor of the Romans,
 and that the multitude wanted <i>novare omnia</i> (XXXV, 34). On the
 frightful struggle between these opposite parties, on the revolutions and
 counter revolutions, see also <i>Polyb.</i>, XIII, 1, 2; XVIII, 36 ff.,

 treasure. (<i>Polyb.</i>, XX, 14, 5, 6.) The events at Corinth, before its

 The disappearance of the middle class in Rome, between the second and
 third Punic war, was brought about chiefly by the great foreign conquests
 made by it. An idea of the wealth which the governors of the provinces
 might extort may be formed from this among other facts, that Cicero
 originally demanded against Verres a fine of 5,000,000 thalers.
 (<i>Cic.</i>, in Verrem Div., 5.) Verres is related to have said, that he
 would be satisfied if he could retain the first year's booty; that during
 the second, he collected for his defenders; and during the third, for his
 judges! (<i>Cic.</i>, in Verr., I, 14.) Even <i>Cicero</i> became richer
 within the space of one year, in Cilicia, where it was well known he was
 not oppressive, by 110,000 thalers, which sum does not include numerous
 presents, pictures, etc. (<i>Drumann</i>, Gesch. Roms., VI, 384.) On the
 frightful oppression and extortion practised by Brutus (!) in Asia, see
 <i>Cicero</i>, ad. Att, V, 21; VI, 1. <i>Sallust</i>, in his Jugurtha, has
 shown how such men waged war, and to what extremes their well-deserved
 want might push them in his Catiline. <i>Patricium scelus!</i> Most of the
 senators were in debt to Crassus; and this, together with his great
 political insurance-activity and power in elections, criminal cases at
 law, etc., it depended that he, for a time, figured beside Cæsar and
 Pompey.</p>
<p class="footnote">The wealth of these important personages must, and

 excited the covetousness of the people; but especially the great number of
 slaves they kept, combined with their pasturage system of husbandry, which
 rapidly spread over all of Italy after the provinces had emptied their
 granaries to supply the wants of the sovereign people, must have made it
 less and less possible for the proletarians to live by the work of their
 hands. Previously, the lower classes of the free born had been exempted
 from the military service, while slaves were conscripted for the fleet.
 Now, all this was changed; and thus was taken away one of the chief causes
 which had made the labor of free day laborers more advantageous on the
 larger estates. (<i>Nitzsch</i>, Gracchen, 124 ff., 235 ff.) The spoils of
 war and conquest caused the higher middle class to prefer to engage in the
 usurious loaning of money rather than in industry which would much more
 rapidly have formed a small middle class. (<i>Mommsen</i>, R. G. I, 622
 ff.)</p>
<p class="footnote">Hence, the <i>misera ac jejuna plebecula, concionalis
 hirudo aerarii</i>, according to <i>Cicero</i>, ad Att., I, 16, 6. At a
 time, when the Roman census showed a population of over 1,500,000,
 Philippus, 104 before Christ, otherwise a "moderate" man, could claim that
 there were not 2,000 citizens who had any property. (<i>Cic.</i>, de Off.,
 II, 21.) True, those few were in such a position, that Crassus would allow
 that those only were rich, who could feed an army at their own expense.
 (<i>Cicero</i>, Parad., VI, 61; <i>Plin.</i>, H. N., XXXIII, 47.)
 Concerning the colossal private fortunes under some of the earlier
 imperators, see <i>Seneca</i>, De Benef., II, 27; <i>Tacit</i>., Ann.,
 XII, 53, XIII, 32; XIV, 35; Dial. de Causis, 8, <i>Dio C.</i>, LXIII, 2
 seq.</p>
<p class="footnote">The clients of the time, that is the numerous poorly
 paid idlers treated as things of little value, in the service of the
 great, correspond, on a small scale, to the position of the great crowd in
 relation to the emperor. Compare <i>Friedländer</i>, Sittengeschichte
 Roms., I, 296 ff. As late as the West-Gothic storm, there were many houses
 which drew 4,000 pounds in gold, and about 1/3 as much in kind, from their
 estates, per annum. (<i>Plut.</i>, Bibl. Cod., 80, 63, Bekk.) Goddess
 Pecunia Majestas divitiarum, in <i>Juvenal</i>, I, 113.</p>
<p class="footnote">If we take the Roman proletariat in its wider extent,
 the most frightful picture it presents is its slave-wars. Such a war
 Sicily had shortly before the <i>tribunate</i> of the elder Gracchus, cost
 over a million (?) livres; and at the same time there was a great uprising
 of slaves desolating Greece. (<i>Athen.</i>, VI, 83, 87 ff., 104.) A
 second war broke out in the time of Cimbri. But the most frightful was
 that under Spartacus, who collected 100,000 men, and the course of this
 uprising will always remain a type of proletarian and slave revolts. It
 originated among the most dangerous class of slaves, most dangerous
 because best prepared for the struggle, the gladiators, and among the
 immense <i>ergastula</i>, where they were held together in large masses.
 It spread with frightful rapidity, because the combustible material on
 which it fed was everywhere to be found. It was conducted with the most
 revolting cruelty. What the slaves demanded before all else was vengeance,
 and what dread had a gladiator of a death unaccompanied by torture?</p>
<p class="footnote">After the first successes of the slaves dissensions
 broke out among them. Such hordes can nowhere long preserve a higher
 object than the momentary gratification of their passions—a fact
 which shields human society from their rage. Piracy, also, is another side
 of this proletarian system. It found its strongest aliment in the system
 of spoliation practiced by the Romans in Asia Minor. The oppressed along
 the whole coast, joined the pirates "preferring to do violence rather than
 to suffer." (<i>Appian</i>, B. Mithr., 92, <i>Dio C.</i>, XXXII, 3.) The
 temples and the wealthy Romans were in special danger. But the worst
 feature in the horrible picture was that many of the great shared in the
 spoils with the robbers. They bought slaves and other booty from them at
 mock prices, even close by the gates of Rome. (<i>Strabo</i>, XIV, 668
 seq., <i>Dio C.</i>, XXXVI, 5.) Precisely as the slave-wars were looked
 upon with pleasure by the poorer free men. Incendiarism was one of the
 chief weapons of mutinous pauperism. (<i>Drumann</i>, IV, 282.) The
 celebrated bacchanalian trial and the questions of poisoning which
 followed it as a consequence (186 before Christ) may be looked upon, in
 Rome, as the first marked symptoms of the disruption between the oligarchy
 of money and the proletariat. This put the morality of the higher classes
 in a bad light, while, at the same time, a large slave conspiracy in
 Apulia, which was not suppressed until the year 185, exhibited the reverse
 of the picture. Cato, the censor, endeavored to oppose this tendency by
 high sumptuary taxes, and by establishing proletarian colonies. At the
 same time we see the various parties among the nobility uniting and the
 publicans joining them. (<i>Nitzsch</i>, Gracchen, 124 ff.) The history of
 the last hundred years of the Republic turns chiefly on the three great
 attempts made by the proletariat to overthrow the citadel of the moneyed
 oligarchy, under the Gracchi, under Marius and under Cæsar. The last was
 permanently successful but entailed the loss of the freedom of both
 parties.</p>
<p class="footnote">Among the pretty nearly useless remedies employed,
 besides those described in § 79, I may mention the following also: the
 great number of agrarian laws intended to lessen estates of too great
 extent owned by one person, and to restore a free peasant population, in
 the years 133, 123, 100, 91, 59 before Christ; the law in Hannibal's time
 (<i>Livy</i>, XXI, 63) that no senator should own a ship with a capacity
 of more than 300 amphora; the provision (<i>Sueton.</i>, Caes., 42) that
 all great herd-owners should take at least one-third of their shepherds
 from the ranks of freemen; the many laws <i>de repetundis</i>, the first
 of which was promulgated 149 before Christ, intended to protect the
 provinces against spoliation by the governors; the L. Gabinia, 56 before
 Christ, which prohibited the loaning by the provinces in Rome; lastly, a
 rigid enforcement of police provisions against slaves, especially against
 their bearing arms, which were carried to such an extent, that slaves who
 had killed a boar with a spear were crucified. (<i>Cicero</i>, in Verr.,
 II, 3.) The chief rule of every real oligarchy of money is, while they
 hold the lower classes in general under their yoke with great severity, to
 keep dangerous elements in good humor at the expense of the state. Among
 these are especially the rabble in large cities and the soldiery. Compare
 <i>Roscher</i>, Betrachtungen über Socialismus und Communismus, 436,
 437.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_204-11"></a>

 In medieval Italy, also, popular freedom was lost through a moneyed
 oligarchy and a proletariat. <i>Popolo grasso</i> and <i>minuto</i>
 (<i>bourgeoisie</i>—<i>peuple</i>) in Florence. The former were
 reproached especially with the breach of trust in the matter of the public
 moneys (<i>Sismondi</i>, Gesch. der Ital. Republiken, II, 323, seq.),
 which reminds one of the French cry, <i>corruption</i> in 1847.
 <i>Machiavelli</i> gives a masterly description of the class contrasts
 during the last quarter of the fourteenth century, in his Istoria
 Fiorent., III, a. 1378, 4. The poor, whose spokesmen recall the most
 desperate shibboleths of modern socialists, dwell principally on this,
 that there is only one important difference, that between rich and poor;
 that all men are by nature entirely equal; that people get rich only
 through deceit or violence; that the poor want revenge etc. It is
 significant how, in Florence, the largest banker finally became absolute
 despot, and that contemporaneously in Genoa, the Bank of St. George, in a
 measure, absorbed the state; the former supported by numerous loans made
 to influential persons like Crassus (<i>Machiavelli</i>, Ist. Fior., VII);
 the latter by the overstraining of the system of national debt.</p>

63), and property enough to be independent of the whims and caprices of
others, and to maintain themselves and the state in times of need, even the
most excellent of constitutions must remain a dead letter. Nor should there
be an entire absence of large fortunes, and even of inherited large
fortunes. The changes of ministry which accompany constitutional government
are fully possible only when the choice of men who would not lose their
social position by a cessation of their salaries as public functionaries is

for food is felt. The bird's-eye-view of those who are born "great" does
not, by any means, embrace the whole truth of human things, but it does a
very important side of it. Among this class, as a rule, it is easiest to

<i>Harrington's</i> fundamental thought (1611-1677, Works, 1700) is, that
 the nature of the constitution of a state depends on the distribution of
 the ownership of its land. "Balance of property!" Where, for instance, one
 person owns all the land or the larger portion of it, we have a despotism;
 where the distribution is more equal, a democracy, etc. All real
 revolutions are based upon a displacement of the centre of gravity of
 property, since in the long run, superstructure and foundation can not be
 out of harmony with each other. For this reason, agrarian laws are the
 principal means to prevent revolutions. (<i>Roscher</i>, Gesch. der
 English. Volkswirthschaftslehre, 53 ff.) <i>Montesquieu</i> also pays
 special attention to the political consequences of the distribution of
 wealth. Thus, for instance, in monarchies, the creation of large fortunes
 should be promoted by the right of primogeniture; in aristocracies, on the
 other hand, the great wealth of a few nobles is as detrimental as that of
 extreme poverty. (Esprit des Lois, V, 8, 9.)</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_205-8"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_205-8" class="pginternal">[205-8]</a>
 The common assertion of the socialists, that the inequality of property is
 frightfully on the increase, is as far from being proved as is the
 opposite one of <i>Hildebrand</i>, Nat. Oek. der Gegenwart und Zukunft, I,
 245 ff. According to <i>Macaulay</i>, Hist. of England, ch. 3, there were,
 in England, in 1685, only about three (ducal) families with an annual
 income of about £20,000 a year. The average income of a lord amounted to
 £3,000; of a baronet, to £900; of a member of the house of commons, to
 scarcely £800; and a lawyer with £1,000 per annum was considered a very
 important personage. At the same time, there were 160,000 families of free
 peasants, that is more than 1/7 of the whole population, whose average
 income amounted to from £60 to £70. For the year 1821, <i>Marshall</i>,
 Digest of all Accounts, etc., II, 1833, assumes, that there were 4,000
 families with over £5,000 yearly income; 52,000 families with from £1,500
 to £5,000; 386,000 families with from £200 to £1,000; 2,500,000 families
 with less than £200. Compare, <i>per contra</i>, the Edinburg Review,
 1835. The income tax statistics of 1847 show that 22 persons had an income
 of at least £50,000 a year; 376 persons, from £10,000 to £50,000; 788,
 from £5,000 to £10,000; 400, from £4,000 to £5,000; 703, from £3,000 to
 £4,000; 1,483, from £2,000 to £3,000; 5,234, from £1,000 to £2,000;
 13,287, from £500 to £1,000; 91,101, from £150 to £500.</p>
<p class="footnote">If we compare these numbers with the corresponding
 ones of the income tax of 1812, the numbers of those who returned an
 income of £150 to £500 increased 196 per cent.; of those with an income of
 from £500 to £1,000, 148 per cent.; of from £1,000 to £2,000, 148 per
 cent.; of from £2,000 to £5,000, 118 per cent.; of from £5,000 and more,
 189 per cent.; while the population in general had increased by about 60
 per cent. Compare Athenæum, August, 1850; Edinburgh Rev., April, 1857.
 Between 1848 and 1857, the development was less favorable, so that the
 incomes of from £150 to £500 subject to taxation, increased only 7 per
 cent.; those from £500 to £1,000 about 9.56 per cent.; those from £10,000
 to £50,000, by 42.4, and those over £50,000, 142.1 per cent. Between 1858
 and 1864, the incomes derived from industry and commerce, subject to
 taxation below £200, had increased about 19.4 per cent.; those over
 £10,000, 59 per cent.; while the aggregate amount of all taxed incomes in
 this category increased 19 per cent. (Stat. Journal, 1865, 546.) According
 to <i>Baxter</i>, The National Income of the United Kingdom, 1868, there
 are now 8,500 persons with a yearly income of £5,000 and more, who draw in
 the aggregate 15.6 per cent. of the national British income, and on the
 average nearly £15,000 each. There are, further, 48,800 persons with a
 yearly income of from £1,000 to £5,000; 178,300 with from £300 to £1,000;
 1,026,400 with from £100 to £300; and 1,497,000 with less than £100 a year
 from their property. In addition to this, 10,961,000 workmen on wages,
 with an aggregate income of £324,600,000. Compare §§ 172, 230.</p>
<p class="footnote">In France, the number of so-called <i>électeurs</i>,
 who paid direct taxes to at least the amount of 200 francs was, in 1831,
 166,583, and increased uninterruptedly until 1845, when it was 238,251,
 while the population had increased only 8.5 per cent.</p>
<p class="footnote">In Prussia, the revenue from class-taxation up to
 1840, increased, unfortunately, in a smaller proportion than the
 population: hence the lowest classes must have increased relatively more
 than the others. (<i>Hoffmann</i>, Lehre von den Steuern, 176 ff.) Between
 1852 and 1873, according to the statistical returns from class-taxation
 and of the classified income tax, the growth of large incomes in the
 provinces of old Prussia, seems to have been much more rapid than that of
 the smaller ones. Thus, for every 100 taxpayers, with an income of from
 400 to 1,000 thalers, there was an increase to 175.5; of from 1,000 to
 1,600 thalers, for every previous 100, 210.2; from 1,600 to 3,200 thalers,
 232.3; of from 3,200 to 6,000, 253.9; of from 6,000 to 12,000 thalers,
 324.8; of from 12,000 to 24,000, 470.6; of from 24,000 to 52,000 thalers,
 576.3; of from 52,000 to 100,000 thalers, 568.4; of from 100,000 to
 200,000 thalers, 533.3; of over 200,000, 2,200. Hence, probably, a greater
 growth towards the top, than the general increase in the population will
 account for.</p>
<p class="footnote">This concentration of property took place most
 noticeably in Berlin, where for instance, between 1853 and 1875 the
 incomes of from 1,000 to 1,600 thalers increased 212.2 per cent.; those
 from 24,000 to 52,000, 994.1 per cent. There are now in the whole state
 2.24 per cent. of the population (including those dependent on them)
 subject to the income tax; that is, estimated as having a yearly income of
 1,000 thalers. Of the remaining 97.76 per cent., more than a quarter, and
 probably more than one-half, are as a class free from taxation, because
 their income is presumably less than 140 thalers (6,049,699 against
 532,367, exempt for other reasons and 4,850,791 belonging to classes
 subject to taxation: these three numbers probably not including
 dependents). Among the payers of an income tax, there are 79,464 with an
 average income of 1,237 thalers per annum; 41,366 with 2,171 thalers;
 12,305 with 4,279 thalers; 4,030 with 8,383 thalers; 1,655 with 16,527
 thalers; 513 with 32,428 thalers; 163 with 65,595 thalers; 39 with 137,692
 thalers; 21 with 427,142 thalers; and one with 1,700,000 thalers per
 annum. (Preuss. statist. Ztschr., 1875, 116, 132, 142, 145, 149.) As the
 reverse of this picture, we may take the fact that, in 1870, of 1,047,974
 cases of guardianship, there were only 208,614 in which there was any
 property to be looked after. (Justiz-Minist-Blatt, 1872, No. 6.)</p>
<p class="footnote">The figures from Bremen are very favorable. The
 incomes subject to taxation amounted, in 1847, to 71.6 thalers per capita;
 in 1869, to 131.2.<a id="fnanchor_TN32"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN32">[TN 32]</a> The incomes subject
 to taxation in class No. 1, that is from 250 to 399 thalers, increased 78
 per cent.; in class No. 2, 400 to 499 thalers, 45 per cent.; in class No.
 3, 500 thalers and more, by 57 per cent. The average income of the third
 class amounted, in 1847-50, to 1,952 thalers; 1866-69, to 2,439 thalers.
 In 1848, there were, of estates of over 3,000 thalers subject to taxation,
 only 38 to every 1,000 inhabitants; in 1866, 49. (Jahrb. f. amtl.

<p class="center smaller">NATURE AND KINDS OF CONSUMPTION.</p>
<p>As it is as little in the power of man to destroy matter as it is to
create it, we mean by the consumption of goods, in the broad sense of the
word, the abolition of or the doing away with an utility without any regard
to the question whether another higher utility takes its place; in its
narrower sense (consumption proper), a decrease of resources of any kind.
Consumption is the counterpart of production (§ 30), the top of the tree of
which production is the roots, and the circulation and distribution of
goods the trunk. (<i>A. Walker.</i>) There is, also, what Riedel calls
immaterial consumption, as when a utility disappears, either because the
want itself to which it ministers disappears or because views have changed
as to the means to be employed towards its satisfaction.<a id="fnanchor_206-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_206-1">[206-1]</a></p>

 Diminutions of value, such, for instance, as an almanac, a newspaper,
 etc., undergoes simply from the appearance of the next years' etc.; of a
 shield or a part of an officer's uniform with the initials of the reigning

<p class="center smaller">NATURE AND KIND OF CONSUMPTION.—THE MOST
USUAL KIND.</p>
<p>The commonest kind of consumption is that caused by the use of a thing,
or by the employing of it for the purpose of acquisition or of enjoyment.<a id="fnanchor_207-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_207-1">[207-1]</a> From time immemorial, enjoyment-consumption
has been, preponderantly, the affair of women, as acquisition-consumption
has been the business of men.<a id="fnanchor_207-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_207-2">[207-2]</a> Other circumstances being equal, the degree or
extent of consumption by use (use-consumption) is determined by national
character. Thus, for instance, the cleanliness and love of order
characteristic of the Dutch have contributed greatly to the long
preservation in good condition of their dwellings and household articles.<a id="fnanchor_207-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_207-3">[207-3]</a></p>
<p>In the higher stages of civilization, the use of goods is wont to be
divided more and more into special branches, according to the different
peculiarities of the goods themselves, and of the different wants of men; a
course of things which is, both as cause and effect, intimately related to
the division of labor. I here speak of a principle of <i>division of
use</i> (differentiation and specialization). Thus, for instance, Lorenz
Lange, in 1722, found only one kind of tea in the trade between Russia and
China; Müller, in 1750, found seven; Pallas, in 1772, ten; and Erman, in
1829, about seven hundred.<a id="fnanchor_207-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_207-4">[207-4]</a> As the number of <span class="pagenum">[Pg
185]</span> gradations of different kinds of the same goods increases with
civilization, there is, in times of war, a retrogression in this respect,
to a lower economic stage.<a id="fnanchor_207-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_207-5">[207-5]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 186]</span>Opposed to this, we have the
principle of the combination of use. There are numberless kinds of goods
which may serve a great many just as well as they can one exclusive user;
and this either successively or simultaneously, inasmuch as there is no
necessity why, with the increasing use of the object, the size of the
object itself should increase in an equal proportion. (According to Marlo:
wealth usable by one; wealth usable by many; wealth usable by all.) Thus,
for instance, a public library may be incomparably more complete, and
accessible in a still higher degree than ten private libraries which
together cost as much as it did. And so, a restaurant-keeper may serve a
hundred guests at the same time, with a much greater table-variety, more to
their taste, and at a more convenient time, than if each person made the
same outlay for his private kitchen.<a id="fnanchor_207-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_207-6">[207-6]</a> While formerly, only the great could travel rapidly,
combination of use has enabled even the lower classes to do so in our own
days. There is, doubtless, a dark side to this picture, too. Combination of
use requires frequently great sacrifices of personal independence, which
should not be underestimated when they affect individuality of character,
or threaten the intimacy and closeness of family life. It is, however, a
bad symptom when the division <span class="pagenum">[Pg 187]</span> of use
increases without any corresponding combination of use.<a id="fnanchor_207-7"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_207-7">[207-7]</a><a id="fnanchor_207-8">

 about 1651, with 12; they are now acquainted with more than 50; in the
 16th century they knew only 4 kinds of sorrel; in 1651, 7; about 1574,
 only 4 kinds of lettuce; to-day they know over 50; under Henry II., they
 were acquainted with 2 or 3 kinds of melons; in the 17th century, with 7;
 now they are acquainted with over 40. (<i>Roquefort</i>, Histoire de la
 Vie privée des Fr., I, 179 ff.) Instead of the four kinds of pears
 mentioned by de Serre (1600), there were, in 1651, about 400. (I, 272.)
 Liebaud, 1570, knew only 19 kinds of grapes; de Serre, 41.
 (<i>Roquefort</i>, III, 29 ff.) According to the "Briefen eines

 kinds of wine were known (<i>Becker</i>, Charicles, I, 455), <i>Pliny</i>,
 H. N. XIV, 13, was acquainted with about 80. In this respect the moderns
 have never returned to ancient simplicity; at least the fabliau, La

 century. (Compare also <i>Wackernagel</i> in <i>Haupt's</i> Zeitschrift

 persistence in a lower stage of civilization, used the same garment in
 winter and summer (<i>Xenoph.</i>, De Rep. Laced., II, 4); while the
 contemporaries of Athenæos (III, 78 ff.) were acquainted with 72 kinds of
 bread. With what a delicate sense for good living the Romans in Caesar's

 The one large kitchen naturally requires much less place, masonry, fuel,
 fewer utensils, etc., than 100 small ones. Think of the relatively large
 savings effected by the use of one oven kept always heated! Even the
 Lacedemonians called their meal associations φειδίτια,<a id="fnanchor_TN35"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN35">[TN 35]</a> i. e., save-meals. Dainties proper can be consumed
 only in very small portions, but cannot well be prepared in such
 quantities. A guest at a first class Parisian restaurant has, at a
 moderate price, his choice of 12 <i>potâges</i>, <i>24 hors d'œuvres</i>,

 Concerning the application of the above principle in industry and in the
 care of the poor, see <i>infra</i>. The advantages afforded by consumption
 in common, or the combination of use, have been enthusiastically dwelt
 upon by <i>Fourier</i>, and the organization of his phalansteries is based
 essentially on that principle. In these colossal palaces, which, spite of
 all their magnificence, cost less than the hundred huts of which they take
 the place, a ball is given every evening, because it is cheaper to light
 one large hall, in which all may congregate. The division of use, or of
 consumption also, is here developed in a high degree. When 12 persons eat
 at the same table they have 12 different kinds of cheese, 12 different
 kinds of soup, etc. Even little children are allowed to yield to the full
 to their gluttonous propensities, since on them depends the productive
 activity of the so-called <i>séries passionnées</i>.<a id="fnanchor_TN36"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN36">[TN 36]</a> Compare Nouveau Monde, 272. The Saint-Simonists

<p class="center smaller">NATURE AND KINDS OF CONSUMPTION.—NOTIONAL
CONSUMPTION.</p>
<p>By the notional consumption (<i>Meinungsconsumtion</i>), as Storch calls
it, operated by a change of fashion, many goods lose their value, without
as much as suffering the least change of form or leaving the merchant's
shop. This kind of consumption, too, is exceedingly different in different
nations. Thus, in Germany, for instance, fashions are much more persistent
than in France.<a id="fnanchor_208-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_208-1">[208-1]</a> In the most flourishing
times of Holland, only noblemen and officers changed with the fashions,
while the merchants and other people wore their clothes until they <span class="pagenum">[Pg 188]</span> went to pieces.<a id="fnanchor_208-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_208-2">[208-2]</a> In the East, fashions in clothing are very
constant;<a id="fnanchor_208-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_208-3">[208-3]</a> but the expensive
custom there prevails, for a son, instead of moving into the house occupied
by his father, to let it go to ruin, and to build a new one as a matter of
preference. The same is true even in the case of royal castles. Hence, in
Persia, most of the cities are half full of ruins, and are in time moved
from one place to another.<a id="fnanchor_208-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_208-4">[208-4]</a></p>
<p>The national income of a country is, on the whole, much less affected by
a change of fashion than the separate incomes of its people. The same whim
which lowers the value of one commodity increases the value of another; and
what has ceased to be in fashion among the rich, becomes accessible,
properly speaking, to the poorer classes of the community for the first
time.<a id="fnanchor_208-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_208-5">[208-5]</a> The want of varying his
enjoyments is so peculiar to man, and so intimately connected with his
capacity for progress, that it cannot in itself be blamed. But if this want
be immoderately yielded to, if the well-to-do should despise every article
which has not the charm of complete novelty, <span class="pagenum">[Pg
189]</span> the advantages of the whole pattern-system, by means of which
the preparation of a large number of articles from the same model at a
relatively small cost, would be lost. Besides, fashion, which makes
production in large quantities, for the satisfaction of wants that are
variable and free, possible, frequently means even a large saving in the
cost of production.<a id="fnanchor_208-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_208-6">[208-6]</a></p>

 The consequences of this are very important to the character of French and
 German industry. (<i>Junghanns</i>, Fortschritte des Zollvereins, I, 28,

 provinces, their fashions in the matter of the table are very slow to do
 so. (<i>Rocquefort</i>, Hist. de la Vie privée des Fr., I, 88 seq.)</p>

 As most persons adorn themselves for the sake of the opposite sex, this
 invariability is caused by the oriental separation of two sexes. Our

 in civilizing the East in this respect. In Persia, shawls are frequently
 inherited through many generations, and even persons of distinction buy
 clothes which had been worn before. (<i>Polak</i>, Persien, I, 153.) In

 In Moscow, merchants close their accounts at Easter. Then begins a new

 (<i>Kohl</i>, Reise, 98.) In Paris, there are houses which buy up
 everything as it begins to go out of fashion and then send it into the
 provinces and to foreign parts. Thus, there are immense amounts of old
 clothing shipped from France and England to Ireland. Hence, the latter
 country can have no national costume appropriate to the different classes;
 and the traveler sees with regret, crowds of Irish going to work in ragged
 frock-coats, short trowsers and old silk hats. In Prussia, many of the
 peasantry, in the time of Frederick the Great, wore the discarded uniforms
 of the soldiery.</p>

<p class="center smaller">CONSUMPTION WHICH IS THE WORK OF NATURE.</p>
<p>The least enjoyable of all consumption (<i>loss-consumption</i>) is that
which is the work of nature; and nature is certainly most consuming in the
tropics. During the rainy season, in the region of the upper Ganges,
mushrooms shoot up in every corner of the houses; books on shelves swell to
such an extent that three occupy the place previously occupied by four;
those left on the table get covered over with a coat of moss one-eighth of
an inch in thickness. The saltpetre that gathers on the walls has to be
removed every week in baskets, to keep it from eating into the bricks.
Numberless moths devour the clothing. Schomburgk found that, in Guiana,
iron instruments which lay on the ground during the rainy season became
entirely useless within a few days, that silver coins oxydized, etc.;
evidently a great obstacle in the way of the employment of machinery. In
summer, the soil of this same region, so rich in roots, is so parched by
the heat, that subterranean fires sometimes cause the most frightful
destruction.</p>
<p>In Spanish America, there are so many termites and other destructive
insects that paper more than sixty years old is very seldom to be found
there.<a id="fnanchor_209-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_209-1">[209-1]</a></p>
<p>The warmer portions of the temperate zone are naturally <span class="pagenum">[Pg 190]</span> most favorable to the preservation of stone
monuments. Thus, for instance, in Persepolis, where there has been no
intentional destruction, the stones lie so accurately superimposed the one
on the other that the lines of junction can frequently be not even seen.
The amphitheatre of Pola has lost in two thousand years only two lines from
the angles of the stones.<a id="fnanchor_209-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_209-2">[209-2]</a> The Elgin marble statues would certainly have lasted
longer in Greece than they will in England. On the other hand, warm and dry
climates have a very peculiar and exceedingly frightful species of
nature-consumption in the locust plagues. The principal countries affected
by such consumption are Asiatic and African Arabistan, the land of the
Jordan and Euphrates, Asia Minor, parts of Northern India. On Sinai, locust
plagues occur, on an average, every four or five years; but from 1811 to
1816, for instance, they destroyed everything each year. Their course is in
its effects like an advancing conflagration. It turns the green country,
frequently in a single day, into a brown desert; and famine and pestilence
follow in its path.<a id="fnanchor_209-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_209-3">[209-3]</a></p>
<p>The colder regions of the temperate zone are exposed to danger and
damage from land-slides in their long series of mountains, and from
avalanches, from quicksands in many of their plains, from floods and the
total destruction of land along <span class="pagenum">[Pg 191]</span> their
coasts;<a id="fnanchor_209-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_209-4">[209-4]</a> but, on the other hand,
they are, relatively speaking, freest from hurricanes, earthquakes and
volcanoes, the ravages of which no human art or foresight is competent to
cope with. From the point of view of civilization and of politics there is
here a great advantage. See § 36. The former maritime power of Venice and
of Holland is closely allied to the dangers with which the sea continually
threatened them, and which was a continual spur to both. But, on the other
hand, the danger from earthquakes which always impends over South America
and Farther India, must produce consequences similar to those of anarchy or
of despotism, because of the uncertainty with which they surround all
relations. See § 39.<a id="fnanchor_209-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_209-5">[209-5]</a></p>

CONSUMED.</p>
<p>Whenever there is question of consumption, it is necessary to examine
with rigid scrutiny, what it is that has been really consumed; that is,
that has lost in utility. The person, for instance, who pays twenty dollars
for a coat, has consumed that amount of capital only when the coat has been
worn out.<a id="fnanchor_210-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_210-1">[210-1]</a> What is called the
consumption of one's income in advance is nothing but the consumption of a

consuming party intends to make good from his future income.<a id="fnanchor_210-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_210-2">[210-2]</a> Fixed capital, too, can certainly be directly
consumed; for instance, when the owner of a house treats the entire rent he
receives from it as net income, makes no repairs, and no savings to put up
a new building at some future time. As a rule, however, the owner of fixed
capital must, in order to consume it, first exchange it against circulating
capital. Thus the prodigality and dissipation, especially of courts of
absolute princes, have found numerous defenders who have claimed that they
are uninjurious, provided only the money spent in extravagance remained in
the country.<a id="fnanchor_210-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_210-3">[210-3]</a> The prodigality itself,
that is, the unnecessary destruction of wealth is not, on that account, any
the less disastrous.<a id="fnanchor_210-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_210-4">[210-4]</a> If, for instance, there
are fire-works to the amount of 10,000 dollars, manufactured exclusively by
the workmen of the country, ordered for a gala day; the night before they
are used for purposes of display, the national wealth embraces two separate
amounts, aggregating 20,000 dollars; that is, 10,000 dollars in silver and
10,000 in rockets, etc. The day after, the 10,000 in silver are indeed
still in existence, but of the 10,000 in rockets, etc., there is nothing
left. If the order had been made from a foreign country the reverse would
have been the case, the silver stores <span class="pagenum">[Pg 193]</span>
of the people would have been diminished, but their supply of powder would
remain intact.</p>
<p>In a similar way, there is occasion given for the greatest
misunderstanding when people so frequently speak of producers and consumers
as if they were two different classes of people. Every man is a consumer of
many kinds of goods; but, at the same time, he is a producer, unless he be
a child, an invalid, a robber, a pick-pocket, etc.<a id="fnanchor_210-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_210-5">[210-5]</a> At the same time, Bastiat is right in saying that in
case of doubt when the interests of production and of consumption come in
conflict, the state, as the representative of the aggregate interest,
should range itself on the side of the latter. If we carry things on both
sides to their extremest consequences, the self-seeking desire of consumers
would lead to the utmost cheapness, that is, to universal superfluity, and
the self-seeking wish of producers to the utmost dearness, that is, to
universal want.<a id="fnanchor_210-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_210-6">[210-6]</a></p>

<p class="p2 center"><a id="S211"></a>SECTION CCXI.</p>
<p class="center smaller">NATURE AND KINDS OF CONSUMPTION.—PRODUCTIVE
CONSUMPTION.</p>
<p>There is no production possible without consumption. The embodiment of a
special utility into any substance is a limitation of its general utility.
Thus, for instance, when corn is baked into bread, it can no longer be used
for the manufacture of brandy or of starch.<a id="fnanchor_211-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_211-1">[211-1]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 194]</span>When, therefore, consumption is a
condition (outlay) to production it is called productive (reproductive).<a id="fnanchor_211-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_211-2">[211-2]</a> Here, indeed, the form of the consumed goods
is destroyed, but the value of the goods lives on in the new product.</p>
<p>There are different degrees of productiveness in consumption also. Thus,
to a scholar, his outlay for books in his own branch is immediately
productive; but nevertheless, books in departments of literature very
remote from his own, pleasure trips, etc. may serve as nutrition and as a
stimulus to his mind. According to § 52, we are compelled to consider all
consumption productive which constitutes a necessary means towards the
satisfaction of a real economic want. We may, indeed, distinguish between
productive consumption in aid of material goods, of personal goods and
useful relations; but in estimating the productiveness of these different
sorts of consumption we are concerned not so much with the nature of the
consumption as the results in relation to the nation's wants. The powder
that explodes when a powder magazine burns is consumed unproductively; but
the powder shot away in war may be productively consumed just as that used
to explode a mine may be unproductively consumed; for instance, when the
war is a just and victorious one and the mining enterprise has failed.<a id="fnanchor_211-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_211-3">[211-3]</a></p>
<p>The maintenance or support of those workmen whom they themselves
acknowledge to be productive is presumably accounted productive consumption
by all political economists. Why not, therefore, the cost of supporting and
educating our children, who, it is to be hoped, will grow up later to be
productive workmen. Man's labor-power is, doubtless, one of the greatest of
all economic goods. But without the means of subsistence, it would die out
in a few days. Hence we may, and even without an atomistic enumeration of
the individual services and products of labor, consider the continued
duration <span class="pagenum">[Pg 195]</span> of that labor-power itself
as the continued duration of the value of the consumed means of
subsistence.<a id="fnanchor_211-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_211-4">[211-4]</a></p>

 Even when air-dried bricks are made from water and clay which cost

 Against the difference formerly usually assumed between productive and
 unproductive consumption, see <i>Jacob</i>, Grundsätze der Nat. Oek., II,
 530. It is because of a too narrow view that <i>Hermann</i> (II, Aufl.,

 consumption.</p>
<p class="p2 center"><a id="S212"></a>SECTION CCXII.</p>
<p class="center smaller">UNPRODUCTIVE CONSUMPTION.</p>
<p>Moreover, unproductive consumption embraces not only every economic
loss, every outlay for injurious purposes,<a id="fnanchor_212-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_212-1">[212-1]</a> but also every superfluous outlay for useful
purposes.<a id="fnanchor_212-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_212-2">[212-2]</a> Yet, not to err in our
classification here, it is necessary to possess the impartiality and
many-sidedness of the historian, which enable one to put himself in the
place of others and feel after them as they felt. The man, for instance,
who, in cities like Regensburg and especially Rome, sees numberless
churches often, so to speak, elbowing one another, cannot fail to recognize
the difference between the buildings of to-day for business, political,
educational and recreative purposes,<a id="fnanchor_TN39"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN39">[TN 39]</a>
and the medieval, for the satisfaction of spiritual wants. The latter also
may, in their own sphere, and in their own time, have, as a rule, operated
productively, as the former operate, often enough, by way of exception
unproductively; as in the case of railway and canal speculations which have
ended in failure. It would be difficult to decide between the relative
value of the two kinds of wants, because the parties to the controversy do
not, for the most part, share the want (<i>Bedürfniss</i>) of their
respective opponents, frequently do not even <span class="pagenum">[Pg
196]</span> understand it, and therefore despise it. Thus, there are
semi-barbarous nations, who can entertain that respect for the laws which
is necessary even from an economic point of view only to the extent that
they see the person whose duty it is to cause them to be observed seated on
a throne and surrounded by impressive splendor. Hence, such splendor here
could not be considered merely unproductive consumption.<a id="fnanchor_212-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_212-3">[212-3]</a></p>
<p>We must, moreover, remark in this place as we did above, § 54, that it
is easiest to pass the boundary line between productive and unproductive
consumption in personal services. In 1830, the expenses of the state, in
Spain, amounted to 897,000,000 of reals per annum; the outlay of municipal
corporations, to 410,000,000, and that for external purposes of religion,
1,680,000,000. (<i>Borrego.</i>) This is certainly no salutary proportion;
but it is scarcely evidence of a worse economic condition than the fact
that in Prussia it would require a basin one Prussian mile in length,
thirty-three and eight-tenths feet broad, and ten feet deep to hold all the
brandy drunk in the country (<i>Dieterici</i>); or this other, that the
British people spend yearly £68,000,000 sterling for taxes and £100,000,000
yearly for spirituous liquors.<a id="fnanchor_212-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_212-4">[212-4]</a>
Berkeley rightly says that the course practiced in Ireland, with its
famishing proletarian population, of exporting the means of subsistence and
exchanging them against delicate wines, etc., is as if a mother should sell
her children's bread to buy dainties and finery for herself with the
proceeds.<a id="fnanchor_212-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_212-5">[212-5]</a> <a id="fnanchor_212-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_212-6">[212-6]</a></p>

<i>Ricardo</i>, Principles, p. 475, was of opinion that an outlay of the
 national or of private income in the payment of personal services
 increased the demand for labor and the wages of labor in a higher degree
 than an equal outlay for material things. The error at the foundation of
 this is well refuted by <i>Senior</i>, Outlines, 160 ff.</p>
<p class="footnote">The first to zealously advocate and treat the theory
 of productive consumption was <i>J. B. Say</i>, Traité, III, ch. 2, seq.;
 Cours pratique, II, 265. But the germs of the doctrine are to be found in
 <i>Dutot</i>, Réflexions politiques sur le Commerce et les Finances, 1738,
 974, <i>éd</i>. Daire. His distinctions are in part drawn with great
 accuracy. Thus he says that, among others, a manufacturer of cloth,
 productively consumes the results of his workmen, but that the workmen
 themselves who exchange these results for bread, consume the latter
 unproductively. <i>Say</i> is guilty of the inconsistency of claiming that
 only that consumption is productive which contributes directly to the
 creation of material exchangeable goods, spite of the fact that he gave
 the productiveness of labor a much wider scope. <i>Rau</i>, Lehrbuch, I, §
 102 ff., 323 seq., is more consistent in so far as he applies the same
 limitation in both cases. (Compare also § 333, 336.) <i>Hermann</i>,
 Staatsw. Untersuchungen, 170 seq., 231 ff., would prefer to see the idea
 of productive consumption banished from the science, for the reason that
 if the value of the thing alleged to be consumed continues, there can be
 no such thing as its consumption. But, I would rejoin: in a good national
 economy, there would be, according to this, scarcely any consumption
 whatever, because the aggregate value of that which I have called above
 productive consumption is unquestionably preserved, and continues in the
 aggregate value of the national products.</p>
<p class="footnote">Productive consumption is ultimately a stage of
 production, just as production itself is ultimately a means to an end,
 consumption, and therefore a preparation for the latter. Both ideas may be
 rigorously kept apart from each other, just as the expenses and receipts
 of a private business man, who makes a great portion of his outlay simply
 with the intention of reaping receipts therefrom, may be. Every one
 desires his production to be as large as possible, and his productive
 consumption, so far it does not fail of its object, as small as possible.
 <i>Riedel</i> rightly says that the theory of reproductive consumption
 serves Political Economy as the bridge which closes the circle formed by
 the action of production, distribution and consumption. (Nat. Oek. III,
 49.) One of the chief fore-runners of the view we advocate was
 <i>McCulloch</i>, Principles, IV, 3 ff. <i>Gr. Soden</i>, Nat. Oek.,
 distinguishes economic consumption, un-economic and anti-economic
 consumption. (Nat. Oek., I, 147.)</p>

maxim: <i>Si quem volueris esse divitem, non est quod augeas divitias, sed
minuas cupiditates (Seneca)</i>, would, if consistently carried out, have
thwarted the advance of civilization and frustrated the improvement of

ado, assume that individuals, and still more nations, are wont to extend
the aggregate of their enjoyments just as far as there is a possibility of
satisfying their wants. But they forget here how great a part is played in
the world, as men are constituted, by the principle of inertia.<a id="fnanchor_214-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_214-2">[214-2]</a> At the first blush, what seems more natural than
that the less labor a people need employ to obtain the most indispensable
means of subsistence, the more time and taste would remain to them to
satisfy their more refined wants. According to this, we should expect to
discover a more refined civilization, especially, in intellectual matters,
in the earliest periods, when population is small, when land exists in
excess and is not yet exhausted. But, in reality, precisely the reverse is
the case. In the earliest stages of civilization<a id="fnanchor_TN42"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN42">[TN
42]</a> accessible to our observation, we find materialism prevailing in
its coarsest form, and life absorbed entirely by the lowest physical wants.
(Tropical lands.) Where bread grows on the trees, and one needs only to
reach out his hand and pluck it; where all one wants to cover his nakedness
is a few palm leaves, ordinary souls find no incentive to an ant-like
activity, or to a union among themselves for economic purposes.<a id="fnanchor_214-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_214-3">[214-3]</a> <span class="pagenum">[Pg 200]</span> When a
Mexican countryman earns enough to keep himself and his family from
absolute want by two days' labor in a week, he idles away the other five.
It never occurs to him that he might devote his leisure time to putting his
hut or his household furniture, etc., in better shape. The necessity of
foresight even is almost unknown; and in the most luxuriantly fertile
country in the world, a bad harvest immediately leads to the most frightful
famine. Humboldt was assured that there was no hope of making the people
more industrious except by the destruction of the banana plantations.<a id="fnanchor_214-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_214-4">[214-4]</a> But, indeed, there would be little gained by
such compulsory industry. To work for any other end than satiation, it is
necessary that man should feel wants beyond the want created by mere
hunger.<a id="fnanchor_214-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_214-5">[214-5]</a> There are so many
conditions precedent (and mutually limiting one another) to a general
advance in civilization, that such an advance can, as a rule, take place
only very gradually. Let us suppose, for instance, a single Indian in
Mexico, perfectly willing to work six days in the week, and in this way to
cultivate a piece of land three times as great as his fellow Indians. Where
would he get the land? He would, for a time find no purchasers for his
surplus, and <span class="pagenum">[Pg 201]</span> therefore not be in a
condition to pay the landlord as much as the latter hitherto received from
the pasturage alone. Not until cities are built and offer the rural
population the products of industry in exchange for theirs, can they be
incited to, or become capable of effecting a better cultivation of the
land. This incentive and this capacity, are inseparably connected with each
other. Where the agricultural population produce no real surplus, but after
the fashion of medieval times, produce everything they want themselves, and
consume all their own products with the exception of the part paid to the
state as a tax, there can scarcely be an industrial class, a commercial
class, or a class devoted to science, art, etc. And, conversely, it is only
the higher civilization which finds expression in the development of these
classes, that, by a more skillful guidance of the national labor, can call
forth its productiveness to an extent sufficient to yield a considerable
surplus of agricultural commodities over and above the most immediate wants
of the cultivators of the soil themselves. Hence, we find that precisely in
those countries which are most advanced in the economic sense, there is
relatively the smallest number of men engaged in agriculture, and
relatively the largest number in production of a finer kind.<a id="fnanchor_214-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_214-6">[214-6]</a> It is here as in private housekeeping: the

 oppose the rigor of the new climate, except by building immoderately large
 fires, until they became acquainted with European teachers. (Edinb.

 the lower stages of civilization cherish a greater contempt for those more
 advanced than they are themselves visited with by the latter. Thus it was
 customary for the Siberian hunting races to utter a malediction: May your
 enemy live like a Tartar, and have the folly to engage in the breeding of
 cattle. (<i>Abulghazi Bahadur</i>, Histoire généalogique des Tartares.)

 Discourses, No. 1, on Commerce. On the other hand, the person who has six
 months before him for which he must labor and lay up a store, if he would
 not famish or freeze, must necessarily be active and frugal; and there are
 other virtues which go along with these. (<i>List</i>, System der polit.
 Oek., I, 304.) According to <i>Humboldt</i>, the change of seasons compels
 man to get accustomed to different kinds of food, and thus fits him to
 migrate. The inhabitants of tropical countries are, on the other hand,
 like caterpillars, which cannot emigrate nor be made to emigrate, on
 account of the uniform nature of their food.</p>

 food, clothing, shelter, heating and lighting have become dearer by 50 per

 increase the salaries of officials, salaries of 300, 600 and 1,000 thalers
 should be raised to 427.5, 800 and 1,275 thalers respectively. (Preuss.

 13.2 for clothing, 5.7 for shelter, 4.6 for furnishing, 5.3 for heating

 The necessity of an equilibrium between production and consumption was
 pretty clear to many of the older political economists. Thus, for
 instance, <i>Petty</i> calls the coarse absence of the feeling of higher
 wants among the Irish the chief cause of their idleness and poverty.
 Similarly <i>Temple</i>, Observations on the N. Provinces, ch. 6, in which
 Ireland and Holland are compared in this relation. <i>North</i>,
 Discourses upon Trade, 14 seq.; Potscr. <i>Roscher</i>, Zur Geschichte der
 english. Volswirthschaftslehre, 83, 91, 127 ff. <i>Becher</i>, polit.
 Discurs., 1668, 17 ff., was of opinion that the principal cause keeping
 the three great estates together, the very soul of their connection, was
 consumption. Hence the peasant lived from the tradesman, and the tradesman
 from the merchant. (<i>Boisguillebert</i>, Détail de la France, I, 4, II,
 9, 21.) According to <i>Berkeley</i>, Querist, No. 20, 107, the awakening
 of wants is the most probable way to lead a people to industry. And so
 <i>Hume</i>, loc. cit., <i>Forbonnais</i>, Eléments du Commerce, I, 364.
 The Physiocrates were in favor of active consumption. Thus <i>Quesnay</i>,
 Maximes générales, 21 seq.; <i>Letrosne</i>, De l'Interêt social, I, 12.
 <i>La reproduction et la consommation sont réciproquement</i><a id="fnanchor_TN43"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN43">[TN 43]</a> <i>la mesure l'une de l'autre.</i> Some of
 them considered consumption even as the chief thing (<i>Mirabeau</i>,
 Philosophie rurale, ch. 1), which could never be too great. Further,
 <i>Verri</i>, Meditazioni, I, 1-4. <i>Büsch</i>, Geldumlauf, III, 11
 ff.</p>
<p class="footnote">The moderns have frequently inequitably neglected the
 doctrine of consumption. Thus it appears to be a very characteristic fact
 that in <i>Adam Smith's</i> great book, there is no division bearing the
 title "consumption," and in the Basel edition of 1801, that word does not
 occur in the index. <i>Droz</i> says that in reading the works of certain
 of his followers, one might think that products were not made for the sake
 of man, but man for their sake. But, on the other hand, there came a
 strong reaction with <i>Lauderdale</i>, Inquiry, ch. 5; <i>Sismondi</i>,
 N. Principes, L., II, passim; <i>Ganilh</i>, Dictionnaire Analytique, 93
 ff., 159 ff.; but especially, and with important scientific discoveries,
 <i>Malthus</i>, Principles, B. II. <i>St. Chamans</i>, Nouvel Essai sur la
 Richesse des Nations, 1824, is an exaggerated caricature<a id="fnanchor_TN44"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN44">[TN 44]</a> of the theory of consumption. For instance, he
 resolves the income of individuals into foreign demand or the demand of
 strangers (29); considers the first condition of public credit to lie in
 the making of outlay (32); and even calls entirely idle consumers
 productive, for the reason that they elevate by their demand a <i>utilité
 possible</i>, to the dignity of a <i>utilité réelle</i> (286 ff.) The view
 advocated by Mirabeau, and referred to above, again represented by <i>E.
 Solly</i>, Considerations on Political Economy, 1814, and by
 <i>Weishaupt</i>, Ueb. die Staatsausgaben und Auflagen, 1819. And so
 according to <i>Carey</i>, Principles, ch. 35, § 6, the real difficulty
 does not lie in production, but in finding a purchaser for the products.
 But he overlooks the fact here that only the possessor of other products
 can appear as a purchaser. From another side, most socialists think almost
 exclusively of the wants of men, and scarcely consider it worth their
 while to pay any attention to the means of satisfying them.</p>

<p class="center smaller">NECESSITY OF THE PROPER SIMULTANEOUS DEVELOPMENT
OF PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION.</p>
<p>Hence, one of the most essential conditions of a prosperous national
economy is that the development of consumption <span class="pagenum">[Pg
203]</span> should keep equal pace with that of production, and supply with
demand.<a id="fnanchor_215-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_215-1">[215-1]</a> The growth of a
nation's economy naturally <span class="pagenum">[Pg 204]</span> depends on
this: that production should always be, so to speak, one step in advance of
consumption, just as the organism of the animal body grows from the fact
that the secretions always amount to something less than the amount of
additional nutrition. A preponderance of secretions would here be disease;
but so would be a too great preponderance of nutrition. Now, the
politico-economical disease which is produced by the lagging behind of
consumption and by the supply being much in advance of the demand, is
called a commercial (market) crisis. Its immediate consequence is, that for
a great many commodities produced, no purchasers can be found. The effect
of this is naturally to lower prices. The profit of capital and wages
diminish. A transition into another branch of production, not overcrowded,
is either not possible at all or is attended with care, great difficulties
and loss. It is very seldom that all these disadvantages are confined to
the one branch in which the disease had its original seat. For, since the
resources of the one class of producers have diminished, they cannot
purchase as much from others as usual. The most distant members of the
politico-economic body may be thereby affected.<a id="fnanchor_215-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_215-2">[215-2]</a></p>

<i>Boisguillebert</i> lays the greatest weight on the harmony of the
 different branches of commerce. <i>L'équilibre l'unique conservateur de
 l'opulence générale</i>; this depends on there being always as many sales
 as purchases. The moment one link in the great chain suffers, all the
 others sympathise. Hence he opposes all taxation of commodities which
 would destroy this harmony. (Nature des Richesses, ch. 4, 5, 6; Factum de
 la France, ch. 4; Tr. des Grains I, 1.) <i>Canard</i> Principes d'E.
 politique, ch. 6, compares the relation between production and consumption
 in national economy with that between arteries and veins in the animal
 body. On the other hand, <i>Sismondi</i>, N. Principes I, 381, describes
 the bewilderment and want which are wont to arise when one wheel of the
 great politico-economical machine turns round more rapidly than the
 others.</p>

<p class="center smaller">COMMERCIAL CRISES IN GENERAL.—A GENERAL
GLUT.</p>
<p>The greater number of such crises are doubtless special; that is, it is
only in some branches of trade that supply outweighs demand. Most theorists
deny the possibility of a general glut, although many practitioners
stubbornly maintain it.<a id="fnanchor_216-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_216-1">[216-1]</a> J. B. Say relies upon
the principle that in the sale of products, as contradistinguished from
gifts, inheritances, etc., payment can always be made only in other
products. If, therefore, in one branch there be so much supplied that the
price declines; as a matter of course, the commodity wanted in exchange
will command all the more, and, therefore, have a better vent. In the years
1812 and 1813, for instance, it was almost impossible to find a market for
dry goods and other similar products. Merchants everywhere complained that
nothing could be sold. At the same time, however, corn, meat and colonial
products were very dear, and, therefore, paid a large profit to those who
supplied them.<a id="fnanchor_216-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_216-2">[216-2]</a> Every producer who
wants to sell anything brings a demand into the market exactly
corresponding to his supply. (<i>J. Mill.</i>) Every seller is <i>ex vi
termini</i> also a buyer; if, therefore production is doubled, purchasing
power is also doubled. (<i>J. S. Mill.</i>) Supply and demand are in the
last analysis, really, only two different sides of one <span class="pagenum">[Pg 206]</span> and the same transaction. And as long as we
see men badly fed, badly clothed, etc., so long, strictly speaking, shall
we be scarcely able to say that too much food or too much clothing has been
produced.<a id="fnanchor_216-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_216-3">[216-3]</a></p>

 When those engaged in industrial pursuits speak of a lasting and
 ever-growing over-production, they have generally no other reason for
 their complaints than the declining of the rate of interest and of the
 undertaker's profit which always accompany an advance in civilization.
 Compare <i>J. S. Mill</i>, Principles, III, ch. 14, 4. However, the same
 author, I, 403, admits the possibility of something similar to a general
 over-production.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_216-2"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_216-2" class="pginternal">[216-2]</a>
<i>Say's</i> celebrated Théorie des Débouchés, called by McCulloch his
 chief merit, Traité, I, ch. 15. At about the same time the same theory was
 developed by <i>J. Mill</i>, Commerce defended, 1808. <i>Ricardo's</i>
 express adhesion, Principles, ch. 21. Important germs of the theory may be
 traced much farther back: <i>Mélon</i>, Essai politique sur le Commerce,
 1734, ch. 2; <i>Tucker</i>, On the Naturalization Bill, 13; Sketch of the
 Advance and Decline of Nations, 1795, 182.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_216-3"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_216-3" class="pginternal">[216-3]</a>
 Precisely the same commercial crisis, that of 1817 seq., which more than
 anything else led <i>Sismondi</i> to the conclusion that too much had been
 produced in all branches of trade, may most readily be reduced to
 <i>Say's</i> theory.</p>
<p class="footnote">There was then a complaint, not only in Europe but
 also in America, Hindoostan, South Africa and Australia, of the
 unsaleableness of goods, overfull stores, etc.; but this, when more
 closely examined, was found to be true only of manufactured articles and
 raw material, of clothing and objects of luxury; while the coarser means
 of subsistence found an excellent market, and were sold even at the
 highest prices. Hence, in this case, there was by no means any such thing
 as over-production. The trouble was that in the cultivation of corn and
 other similar products, too little was produced. There was a bad harvest
 even in 1816.</p>
<p class="footnote">The most important authorities in favor of the
 possibility of a general glut are <i>Sismondi</i>, N. Principes, IV, ch.
 4, and in the Revue encyclopédique, Mai, 1824: Sur la Balance des
 Consommations avec les Productions. Opposed by Say in the same periodical
 (Juilliet, 1824); where the controversy was afterwards reopened in June
 and July, 1827, by <i>Sismondi</i> and <i>Dunoyer</i>. Compare Etudes,
 vol. I; <i>Ganilh</i>, Théorie, II, 348 ff.; <i>Malthus</i>, Principles,
 II, ch. 1, 8. Compare <i>Rau</i>, <i>Malthus</i> and Say, über die
 Ursachen der jetzigen Handelsstockung, 1821. <i>Malthus'</i> views were
 surpassed by <i>Chalmers</i>, On Political Economy in Connexion with the
 moral State of Society, 1832. But even <i>Malthus</i> himself in his
 Definitions, ch. 10, No. 55, later, so defined a "general glut" that there
 could be no longer question of his holding to its universality. For an
 impartial criticism, see especially <i>Hermann</i>, Staatsw.
 Untersuchungen, 251, and <i>M. Chevalier</i>, Cours, 1, Leçon, 3.</p>
<p class="p2 center"><a id="S217"></a>SECTION CCXVII.</p>
<p class="center smaller">COMMERCIAL CRISES IN GENERAL.</p>
<p>All these allegations are undoubtedly true, in so far as the whole world
is considered one great economic system, and the aggregate of all goods,
including the medium of circulation, is borne in mind. The consolation
which might otherwise lie herein is made indeed to some extent unrealizable
by these conditions. It must not be forgotten in practice that men are
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 207]</span> actuated by other motives than that
of consuming as much as possible.<a id="fnanchor_217-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_217-1">[217-1]</a>
As men are constituted, the full consciousness of this possibility is not
always found in connection with the mere power to do, to say nothing of the
will to do.<a id="fnanchor_217-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_217-2">[217-2]</a> There are, everywhere,
certain consumption-customs corresponding with the distribution of the
national income. Every great and sudden change in the latter is therefore
wont to produce a great glut of the market.<a id="fnanchor_217-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_217-3">[217-3]</a> The party who in such case wins, is not wont to
extend his consumption as rapidly as the loser has to curtail his; partly
for the reason that the former <span class="pagenum">[Pg 208]</span> cannot
calculate his profit as accurately as the latter can his loss.<a id="fnanchor_217-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_217-4">[217-4]</a></p>
<p>Thus laws, the barriers interposed by tariffs, etc., may hinder the
too-much of one country to flow over into the too-little of another.
England, for instance might be suffering from a flood of manufactured
articles and the United States from an oppressive depreciation in the value
of raw material; but the tariff-laws places a hermetic dike between want on
one side and superfluity on the other. Strong national antipathies and
great differences of taste stubbornly adhered to may produce similar
effects; for instance between the Chinese and Europeans. Even separation in
space, especially when added to by badness of the means of transportation
may be a sufficient hinderance especially when transportation makes
commodities so dear that parties do not care to exchange. In such cases, it
is certainly imaginable that there should be at once a want of proper vent
or demand for all commodities; provided, we look upon each individual class
of commodities the world over as one whole, and admit the exception that in
individual places, certain parts of the whole more readily find a market
because of the general crisis.</p>
<p>Lastly, the mere introduction of trade by money destroys as it were the
use of the whole abstract theory.<a id="fnanchor_217-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_217-5">[217-5]</a> So long as original barter prevailed, supply and
demand met face to face. But by the intervention of money, the seller is
placed in a condition to purchase only after a time, that is, to postpone
the other <span class="pagenum">[Pg 209]</span> half of the
exchange-transaction as he wishes. Hence it follows that supply does not
necessarily produce a corresponding demand in the real market. And thus a
general crisis may be produced, especially by a sudden diminution of the
medium of circulation.<a id="fnanchor_217-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_217-6">[217-6]</a> And so, many very
abundant harvests, which have produced a great decline in the value of raw
material, and no less so a too large fixation of capital which stops before
its completion,<a id="fnanchor_217-7"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_217-7">[217-7]</a> may lead to general
over-production. In a word, production does not always carry with itself
the guaranty that it shall find a proper market, but only when it is
developed in all directions, where it is progressive and in harmony with
the whole national economy. <span class="pagenum">[Pg 210]</span> To use
Michel Chevalier's expression, the saliant angles of the one-half must
correspond to the re-entrant angles of the other, or confusion will reign
everywhere. Even in individual industrial enterprises, the proper
combination of the different kinds of labor employed in them is an
indispensable condition of success. Let us suppose a factory in which there
are separate workmen occupied with nothing but the manufacture of ramrods.
If these now exceed the proper limits of their production and have
manufactured perhaps ten times as many ramrods as can be used in a year,
can their colleagues, employed in the making of the locks or butt-ends<a id="fnanchor_TN45"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN45">[TN 45]</a> of the gun, profit by their outlay? Scarcely.
There will be a stagnation of the entire business, because part of its
capital is paralyzed, and all the workmen will suffer damage.<a id="fnanchor_217-8"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_217-8">[217-8]</a> <a id="fnanchor_217-9"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_217-9">[217-9]</a></p>

 If all the rich were suddenly to become misers, live on bread and water,
 and go about in the coarsest clothing, etc., it would not be long before
 all commodities, the circulating medium excepted, would feel the want of a
 proper market—all, including even the most necessary means of
 subsistence, because a multitude of former consumers, having no
 employment, would be obliged to discontinue their demand. Over-production
 would be greater yet if a great and general improvement in the industrial
 arts or in the art of agriculture had gone before. Compare,
 <i>Lauderdale</i> Inquiry, 88. This author calls attention to the fact
 that a market in which the middle class prevails must put branches of
 production in operation very different from those put in operation where
 there are only a few over-rich people, and numberless utterly poor ones:
 England, the United States—the East Indies, and France before the
 Revolution. (Ch. 5, especially p. 358.)</p>

 If England, for instance, became bankrupt as a nation, the country would
 not therefore become richer or poorer. The national creditors would lose
 about £28,000,000 per annum, but the taxpayers would save that sum every
 year. Now, of the former, there are not 300,000 families; of the latter
 there are at least 5,000,000. Hence, the loss would there amount to £100 a
 family per annum, and the gain here to not £6 per family. We may therefore
 assume with certainty that the two items would not balance each other as
 to consumption. The creditors of the nation, a numerous, and hitherto a
 largely consuming class, now impoverished, would be obliged to curtail
 their demand for commodities of every kind to a frightful extent; while a
 great many taxpayers would not feel justified in basing an immediate
 increase of their demand on so small a saving. Other revolutions, more
 political in character, may operate in the same direction by despoiling a
 brilliant court, a luxurious nobility or numerous official classes of
 their former income.</p>

 The above truth has been exaggerated by Malthus and his school into the
 principle that a numerous class of "unproductive consumers," who consume
 more than they produce, is indispensable to a flourishing national
 economy. From this point of view, the magnitude of England's debt
 especially has been made a subject of congratulation. Compare
 <i>Malthus</i>, Principles, II, ch. 1, 9. Similarly <i>Ortes</i>, E. N.,
 III, 17, to whom even the <i>impostori mezzani</i> and <i>ladri</i> seem
 to be a kind of necessity. (III, 23.) <i>Chalmers</i>, Political Economy,
 III ff. If it was only question of consumption here, all that would be
 needed would be to throw away the commodities produced in excess. Those
 writers forget that a consumer, to be desirable, should be able to offer
 counter-values.</p>

 Let us suppose a country which has been used to effecting all its
 exchanges by means of $100,000,000. All prices have been fixed, or have
 regulated themselves accordingly. Let us now suppose that there has been a
 sudden exportation of $10,000,000, and under such circumstances as to
 delay the rapid filling up of the gap thus created. In the long run, the
 demand of a country for a circulation may be satisfied just as well with
 $90,000,000 as with $100,000,000; only it is necessary in the first
 instance that the circulation should be accelerated or that the price of
 money should rise 10 per cent. But neither of these accommodations is
 possible immediately. In the beginning, sellers will refuse to part with
 their goods 10 per cent. cheaper than they have been wont to. But so long
 as those engaged in commercial transactions have not become completely
 conscious of the revolution which has taken place in prices, and do not
 act accordingly, there is evidently a certain ebb in the channels of
 trade, and simultaneously in all. Demand and supply are kept apart from
 each other by the intervention of a generally prevailing error concerning
 the real price of the medium of circulation, and there must be, although
 only temporarily, buyers wanted by every seller, except the seller of
 money. In a country with a paper circulation, every great depreciation of
 the value of the paper money not produced by a corresponding increase of
 the same, may produce such results. <i>Say</i> is wrong when he says that
 a want of instruments of exchange may be always remedied immediately and
 without difficulty.</p>

 Suppose a people, the country population of which produce annually
 $100,000,000 in corn over and above their own requirements, and thus open
 a market for those engaged in industrial pursuits to the extent of
 $100,000,000. And suppose that in consequence of three plentiful harvests,
 and because of an inability to export, the market should grow to be
 over-full, to such an extent that the much greater stores of corn have now
 (§ 5, 103) a much smaller value in exchange than usual. The latter may
 have declined to $70,000,000. Hence the country people now can buy from
 the cities only $70,000,000 of city wares. The cities, therefore, suffer
 from over-production. That people dispensing with the use of money should
 establish an immediate trade between wheat and manufactured articles, in
 which case the latter would exchange against a large quantity of the
 former, is not practicable, because no one can extend his consumption of
 corn beyond the capacity of his stomach, and the storage of wheat with the
 intention of selling it when the price advances is attended with the
 greatest difficulties.</p>

<p class="center smaller">EFFECT OF PRODIGALITY.</p>
<p>Prodigality destroys goods which either were capital or might have
become capital. But, at the same time, it either directly or indirectly
increases the demand for commodities. Hence, for a time, it raises not only
the interest of capital, but the prices of many commodities. Consumers
naturally suffer in consequence; many producers make a profit greater than
that usual in the country until such time as the equilibrium between supply
and demand has been restored by an increase of the supply of the coveted
products. But the capital of spendthrifts is wont to be suddenly exhausted;
demand suddenly decreases, and producers suffer a crisis. As Benjamin
Franklin says, he who buys superfluities will at last have to sell
necessities. Thus the extravagance of a court may contribute <span class="pagenum">[Pg 212]</span> to the rapid prosperity of a place of
princely residence.<a id="fnanchor_219-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_219-1">[219-1]</a> But it should not be
forgotten that all the food-sap artificially carried there had to be

 Only the superficial observer is apt to notice this apparent prosperity of
 the capital much more readily than the decline of the rest of the country,
 which covers so much more territory. In like manner, many wars have had
 the appearance of promoting industry, for the reason that some branches
 grew largely in consequence of the increased demand of the state; but they
 grew at the expense of all others which had to meet the increased taxes.
 Compare <i>Jacob</i> in <i>Lowe</i>, England nach seinem gegenwartigen
 Zustande, 1823, cap. 2, 3; <i>Nebenius</i>, Oeffentlicher Credit, I, Aufl.,

 department of the Bouches du Rhone, to 39,000,000 francs; in 1855, on the
 other hand, they were, on account of the war, 887,000,000 francs and
 141,000,000. (Journal des Econ., Juil., 1857, 32 ff.)</p>

 The Journal des Economistes for March, 1854, very clearly shows, in
 opposition to the state-sophists who recommended extravagant balls, etc.
 as a means of advancing industry, and who even advocated the paying
 officials higher salaries on this account, and making greater outlays by
 them compulsory, that such luxury when it comes of itself may be a symptom
 of national wealth, but that it is a very bad means to produce prosperity
 artificially.</p>
<p class="p2 center"><a id="S220"></a>SECTION CCXX.</p>
<p class="center smaller">WHEN SAVING IS INJURIOUS.</p>
<p>The act of saving, if the consumption omitted was a productive one, is
detrimental to the common good; because now a real want of the national
economy remains unsatisfied.<a id="fnanchor_220-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_220-1">[220-1]</a> The effecting of savings by curtailing unproductive
consumption may embarrass those who had calculated on its continuance. But
its utility or damage to the whole national economy will <span class="pagenum">[Pg 213]</span> depend on the application or employment of
what is saved. Here two different cases are possible.</p>
<p>A. It is stored up and remains idle. If this happens to a sum of money,
the number of instruments of exchange in commerce is diminished. Hence, in
consequence, there may be either a general fall in the price of
commodities, or some commodities may remain unsold; that is, according to §
217, a commercial crisis of greater or smaller extent.<a id="fnanchor_220-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_220-2">[220-2]</a> If it be objects of immediate consumption that are
stored up and lie idle, articles of food or clothing, for instance, the
price of such commodities is wont to be raised by the new and unusual
demand <span class="pagenum">[Pg 214]</span> for them, precisely as it is
lowered afterwards when the stores are suddenly opened and thrown upon the
market.<a id="fnanchor_220-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_220-3">[220-3]</a></p>
<p>B. If the saving effected be used to create fixed capital, there is as
much consumption of goods, the same support of employed workmen, the same
sale for industrial articles as in the previous unproductive consumption;
only, there the stream is usually conducted into other channels. If a rich
man now employs in house-building what he formerly paid out to mistresses;
masons, carpenters, etc. earn what was formerly claimed by hair-dressers,
milliners, etc.: there is less spent for truffles and champagne and more
for bread and meat. The last result is a house which adds permanently
either to personal enjoyment, or permanently increases the material
products of the nation's economy.<a id="fnanchor_220-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_220-4">[220-4]</a>
And it is just so when the wealth saved is used as circulating capital.
Here, the wealth saved is consumed in a shorter or longer time; and to
superficial observers, this saving might seem like destruction; but it is
distinguished from the last by this, that it always reproduces its full
equivalent and more. However, the whole quantity of goods brought into the
market by such new capital cannot be called its product. Only the use
(<i>Nützung</i>) of the new capital can be so called; that is the holding
together or the development in some other way of other forces which were
already in existence until their achievements are perfected and ready for
sale.<a id="fnanchor_220-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_220-5">[220-5]</a> <a id="fnanchor_220-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_220-6">[220-6]</a></p>

 The custom of burying treasure is produced by a want of security (compare
 <i>Montanari</i>, Delia Moneta, 1683-87, 97 Cust.), and by an absence of
 the spirit which leads to production. As <i>Burke</i> says, where property
 is not sacred, gold and silver fly back into the bosom of the earth whence
 they came. Hence, in the middle ages, this custom was frequent, and is
 yet, in most oriental despotic countries. (<i>Montesquieu</i>, E. des L.,
 XXII, 2.) And so in Arabia: <i>d'Arvieux</i>, <i>Rosenmüller's</i>
 translation, 61 seq. <i>Fontanier</i>, Voyage dans l'Inde et dans le Golfe
 persique, 1644, I, 279. A Persian governor on his death bed refused to
 give any information as to where he had buried his treasure. His father
 had always murdered the slave who helped him to bury his money or any part
 of it. (<i>Klemm</i>, Kulturgeschichte, VII, 220.) In lower stages of
 civilization, it is a very usual luxury to have one's treasures buried
 with the corpse. In relation to David's grave, see <i>Joseph.</i>, Ant.
 Jud., VII, 15,3, XIII, 8, 4; XVI, 7, 1. Hence the orientals believe that
 <i>every</i> unknown ruin hides a treasure, that every unintelligible
 inscription is a talisman to discover it by, and that every scientific
 traveler is a treasure-digger, (<i>v. Wrede</i>, R. in Hadhramaut, 113,
 182 and <i>passim</i>.) Similarly in Sicily. (<i>Rehfues</i>, Neuester
 Zustand von S., 1807, I, 99.) In the East Indies every circumstance that
 weakens confidence in the power of the government increases the frequency
 of treasure-burial, as was noticed, for instance, after the Afghan defeat.
 Treasure-burial by the Spanish peasantry (<i>Borrego</i>, translated by
 Rottenkamp, 81), in Ireland (<i>Wakefield</i>, Account of I. I, 593), in
 the interior of Russia (<i>Storch</i>, Handbuch, I, 142), and among the
 Laplanders. The custom was very much strengthened among the latter when,
 in 1813, they lost 80 per cent. by the bankruptcy of the state through its
 paper money. (<i>Brooke</i>, Winter in Lapland, 1829, 119; compare
 <i>Blom</i>, Statistik von Norwegen, II, 205.) As during the Thirty Years'
 War, so also in 1848, it is said that large amounts of money were burned
 by the Silesian and Austrian peasantry. Much of it is lost forever, but,
 on the whole, much treasure is wont to be found where much is buried;
 governments there make it a regal right to search for it.</p>

<a href="#fnanchor_220-3" class="pginternal">[220-3]</a>
 If the hoarding takes place in a time of superfluity, and the restitution
 of the stores in a time of want, there is of course no detrimental
 disturbance, but on the contrary the consequence is a beneficent
 equilibrium of prices. This is the fundamental idea in the storage of
 wheat.</p>

 In the construction of national buildings, etc., we have the following
 course of things: compulsory contributions made by taxpayers, or an
 invitation to the national creditors to desist somewhat from their usual
 amount of consumption, and to employ what is saved in the building of
 canals, roads etc. In France, for instance, after 1835, 100,000,000 francs
 per annum. (<i>M. Chevalier</i>, Cours, I, 109.) The higher and middle
 classes of England saved, not without much trouble, however, between 1844
 and 1858, £134,500,000 in behalf of railway construction.

 Such savings have sometimes been prescribed by the state. In ancient
 Athens many prohibitions of consumption in order to allow the productive
 capital to first attain a certain height. Thus it was forbidden to
 slaughter sheep until they had lambed, or before they were shorn.
 (<i>Athen.</i>, IX, 375, I. 9.) Similarly<a id="fnanchor_TN47"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN47">[TN

<p class="p2 center"><a id="S221"></a>SECTION CCXXI.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 215]</span></p>
<p class="center smaller">LIMITS TO THE SAVING OF CAPITAL.</p>
<p>It may be seen from the foregoing, that the mere saving of capital, if
the nation is to be really enriched thereby, has its limits. Every consumer
likes to extend his consumption-supply and his capital in use
(<i>Gebrauchskapitalien</i>); but not beyond a certain point.<a id="fnanchor_221-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_221-1">[221-1]</a> Besides, as trade becomes more flourishing, smaller
stores answer the same purpose. And no intelligent man can desire his
productive capital increased except up to the limit that he expects a
larger market for his enlarged production. What merchant or manufacturer is
there who would rejoice or consider himself enriched, if the number of his
customers and their desire to purchase remaining the same, he saw his
stores of unsaleable articles increase every year by several thousands?</p>
<p>This is another difference between national resources or world resources
and private resources. The resources of a private person, which are only a
link in the whole chain of trade, and which are, therefore, estimated at
the value in exchange of their component parts should, indeed, always be
increased by savings made. (§ 8.) For even the most excessive <span class="pagenum">[Pg 216]</span> increase of supply in general, which
largely lowers the price of a whole class of commodities, will never reduce
the price of individual quantities of that commodity below zero, and
scarcely to zero. It is quite otherwise in the case of national or world
resources which must be estimated according to the value in use of their
component parts. Every utility supposes a want. Where, therefore, the want
of a commodity has not increased, and notwithstanding there is a continuing
increase in the supply, the only result must be a corresponding decrease in
the utility of each individual part.<a id="fnanchor_221-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_221-2">[221-2]</a></p>
<p>If a people were to save all that remained to them over and above their
most urgent necessities, they would soon be obliged to seek a wider market
in foreign countries, or loan their capital there; but they would make no
advance whatever <span class="pagenum">[Pg 217]</span> in higher culture
nor add anything to the gladness of life.<a id="fnanchor_221-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_221-3">[221-3]</a> On the other hand, if they would not save at all,
they would be able to extend their enjoyments only at the expense of their
capital and of their future. Yet these two extremes find their correctives
in themselves. In the former case, a glut of the market would soon produce
an increased consumption and a diminished production; in the latter the
reverse. The ideal of progress demands that the increased outlay with
increased production should be made only for worthy objects, and chiefly by
the rich, while the middle and lower classes should continue to make
savings and thus contribute to wipe out differences of fortune.<a id="fnanchor_221-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_221-4">[221-4]</a></p>

 Up to this point, indeed, wants increase with the means of their
 satisfaction. The man who has two shirts always strives to get a dozen,
 while the person who has none at all, very frequently does not care for
 even one. And so the person who has silver spoons generally desires also
 to possess silver candle-sticks and silver plates. On Lucullus' 5,000
 chlamydes, see <i>Horat.</i>, Epist., I, 6, 40 ff.</p>

 That consumption and saving are not two opposites which exclude each other
 is one of <i>Adam Smith's</i> most beautiful discoveries. See Wealth of
 Nat., II, ch. 3. But compare <i>Pinto</i>, Du Crédit et de la Circulation,
 1771, 335. Before his time most writers who were convinced of the
 necessity of consumption were apologists of extravagance. Thus <i>v.
 Schröder</i>, F. Schatz- und Rentkammer, 23 seq. 47, 172. Louis XIV.'s
 saying: "A King gives alms when he makes great outlays." According to
 <i>Montesquieu</i>, Esprit des Louis<a id="fnanchor_TN48"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN48">[TN
 48]</a> VII., 4, the poor die of hunger when the rich curtail their
 expenses. This view, which must have found great favor among the imitators
 of Louis XIV. and Louis XV. was entertained to some extent by the
 Physiocrates; for instance, <i>Quesnay</i>, Maximes générales, 21 seq.
 Compare <i>Turgot</i>, Œuvres, éd, <i>Dare</i>, 424 ff. On the other hand,
 <i>Adam Smith</i>, loc. cit. says that the spendthrift is a public enemy,
 and the person who saves a public benefactor. <i>Lauderdale</i>, Inquiry,
 219, reacts so forcibly against the one-sidedness which this involves that
 he believes no circumstance possible "which could so far change the nature
 of things as to turn parsimony into a means of increasing wealth." In his
 polemic against Pitts' sinking fund as inopportune and excessive, he
 assumes that all sums saved in that way are completely withdrawn from the
 national demand. See per contra <i>Hufeland</i> n. Grundlegung I, 32, 238.
 <i>Sismondi</i>, N. P. II, ch. 6, with his distinction between
 <i>production</i> and <i>revenu</i>, is more moderate; the former is
 converted into the latter only in as much as it is "realized," that is,
 finds a consumer who desires it, and pays for it. Now only can the
 producer rely on anything; can he restore his productive capital, estimate
 his profit, and use it in consumption, and lastly begin the whole business
 over again.... A stationary country must remain stationary in everything.
 It cannot increase its capital and widen its market while its aggregate
 want remains unaltered. (IV, ch. 1.)</p>

 Thus <i>John Stuart Mill</i> thinks that the American people derive from
 all their progress and all their favorable circumstances only this
 advantage: "that the life of the whole of one sex is devoted to
 dollar-hunting, and of the other to breeding dollar-hunters." (IV, ch. 6,
 2.) In the popular edition of 1865, after the experience of the American

<i>Storch</i>, Nationaleinkommen, 125 ff. That there is at least not too
 much to be feared from the making of too great savings is shown by
 <i>Hermann</i>, St. Untersuch., 371 seq. On the other hand, there is less
 wealth destroyed by spendthrifts than is generally supposed, for
 spendthrifts are most frequently cheated by men who make savings
 themselves. (<i>J. S. Mill</i>, Principles, I, ch. 5, 5.)</p>

<p>As there are extravagant and frugal individuals, so also are there
extravagant and frugal nations. Thus, for instance, we must ascribe great
national frugality to the Swiss. In many well-to-do families in that
country, it is a principle acted upon to require the daughters to look to
the results of their white sewing, instead of giving them pin-money; to
gather up the crumbs after coffee parties in the presence of the guests,
and to make soup of them afterwards, etc. Sons are generally neither
supported nor helped to any great extent by their <span class="pagenum">[Pg
218]</span> parents in their lifetime, and are required to found their own
homes. They, therefore, grow rich from inheritance only late in years, when
they are accustomed to a retired and modest mode of life, and have little
desire, from mere convenience sake, to change it for another. And so Temple
informs us that it never occurs to the Dutch that their outlay should equal
their income; and when this is the case they consider that they have spent
the year in vain. Such a mode of life would cost a man his reputation there
as much as vicious excess does in other countries. The greatest order and
the most accurate calculation of all outlay in advance is found in union
with this; so that Temple assures us he never heard of a public or private
building which was not finished at the time stipulated for in advance.<a id="fnanchor_222-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_222-1">[222-1]</a></p>
<p>On the other hand, the Englishman lives rather luxuriantly. He is so
used to enjoying comparative abundance, that when English travelers see the
peasantry of the continent living in great frugality, they generally
attribute it to poverty and not to their disposition to make savings. If
England has grown rich, it is because of the colossal magnitude of its
production, which is still more luxuriant and abundant than its
consumption.<a id="fnanchor_222-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_222-2">[222-2]</a> This contrast may be
the effect in part of nationality and climate;<a id="fnanchor_222-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_222-3">[222-3]</a> <span class="pagenum">[Pg 219]</span> but it is
certainly the effect in part also of a difference in the stage of
civilization which these countries have respectively reached. The elder
Cato had a maxim that a widow might, indeed, allow her fortune to diminish,
but that it was a man's duty to leave more behind him than he had
inherited.<a id="fnanchor_222-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_222-4">[222-4]</a> And how prodigally did not

 As early a writer as <i>D. Defoe</i>, Giving Alms no Charity! 1704, says:
 the English get estates; the Dutch save them. An Englishman at that time
 with weekly wages of 20 shillings just made ends meet; while a Dutchman
 with the same grew rich, and left his children behind him in very
 prosperous circumstances, etc. <i>L. Faucher</i> draws a similar contrast
 between his fellow countrymen and the English. <i>Goethe's</i> ingenuous
 observations (Werke, Bd., 23, 246, ed. of 1840) in his Italian journey,
 show that the Italians, too, know how to save. <i>Molti pochi fanno un
 assai!</i> And so in Bohemia, the Czechs have a good reputation for
 frugality, sobriety, etc. as workmen. They are more frugal than the
 Germans, although all the larger businesses belong to Germans, because
 when the Czech has saved something, he prefers to return to his village to
 putting his savings in jeopardy by speculation.</p>

 Drunkenness a common vice of northern people: thus in antiquity the
 Thracians (<i>Athen.</i>, X, 42; <i>Xenoph.</i>, Exp. Cyri, VII, 3, 32),
 the Macedonians, for instance, Philips (<i>Demosth.</i>, Olynth., II, 23)
 and Alexander's (<i>Plutarch</i>, Alex., 70; De Adulat, 13). To drink like
 a Scythian, meant, among the Greeks, to drink like a beast.

<p>The kind of extravagance which it is most natural we should desire to
see put an end to, is that which procures enjoyment to no one. I need call
attention only to the excessive durability and solidity of certain
buildings. It is more economical to build a house that will last 60 years
for $10,000, than one which will last 400 years for $20,000; for in 60
years the interest saved on the $10,000 would be enough to build three such
houses.<a id="fnanchor_223-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_223-1">[223-1]</a> This is, of course, not
applicable to houses built as works of art, or only to produce an imposing
effect. The object the ancient Egyptians had in view in building their
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 220]</span> obelisks and pyramids continues to be
realized even in our day.</p>
<p>I might also call attention to the premature casting away of things
used. Our national economy has saved incredible sums since rags have been
manufactured into paper. In Paris 4,000 persons make a living from what
they pick up in the streets.<a id="fnanchor_223-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_223-2">[223-2]</a></p>

 of the age of chivalry, the Roman aqueducts, theaters, etc., which are
 still in a good state of preservation, but which can be used by no one; so
 many bridges too narrow for our purposes, and so many roads too steep. The
 sluices at Dunkirk, made 12.60 metres in width by Vauban, were made 16
 meters wider in 1822, and still are too narrow for Atlantic steamships. In

<h3>LUXURY.</h3>
<p class="p2 center"><a id="S224"></a>SECTION CCXXIV.</p>
<p class="center smaller">LUXURY IN GENERAL.</p>
<p>The idea conveyed by the word luxury is an essentially relative one.
Every individual calls all consumption with which he can dispense himself,
and every class that which seems not indispensable to themselves, luxury.
The same is true of every age and nation. Just as young people ridicule
every old fashion as pedantry, every new fashion is censured by old people
as luxury.<a id="fnanchor_224-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_224-1">[224-1]</a></p>
<p>But (§ I) a higher civilization always finds expression in an increased
number and an increased urgency of satisfied wants. Yet, there is a limit
at which new or intensified wants cease to be an element of higher
civilization, and become elements of demoralization. Every immoral and
every unwise want <span class="pagenum">[Pg 222]</span> exceeds this
limit.<a id="fnanchor_224-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_224-2">[224-2]</a> Immoral wants are not only
those the satisfaction of which wounds the conscience, but also those in
which the necessities of the soul are postponed to the affording of
superfluities to the body; and where the enjoyment of the few is purchased
at the expense of the wretchedness of the many. And not only those are
unwise or imprudent for which the voluntary outlay is greater than one's
income, but those also where the indispensable is made to suffer for the
dispensable.</p>
<p>Thus it was in Athens, in the time of Demosthenes, when the festivities
of the year cost more than the maintenance of the fleet; when Euripides'
tragedies came dearer to the people than the Persian war in former times.
There was even a law passed (Ol. 107,4) prohibiting the application of the
dramatic fund to purposes of war under pain of death.<a id="fnanchor_224-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_224-3">[224-3]</a></p>
<p>In the history of any individual people, it may be shown with
approximate certainty at what point luxury exceeded its salutary limits.
But in the case of two different nations, it is quite possible that what
was criminal prodigality with the one, may have been a salutary enjoyment
of life with the other; in case their economic (<i>wirthschaftlichen</i>)
powers are different. Precisely as in the case of individuals, where for
instance, the daily drinking of table wine may be simplicity in the rich
and immoral luxury in the case of a poor father of a family.<a id="fnanchor_224-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_224-4">[224-4]</a> Healthy reason has this peculiarity, that
where people will not listen to it, it never hesitates to make itself<a id="fnanchor_TN50"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN50">[TN 50]</a> felt. (<i>Benjamin Franklin.</i>)<a id="fnanchor_224-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_224-5">[224-5]</a></p>
<p>However, the luxury of a period always throws itself, by way of
preference, on those branches of commodities which are cheapest.</p>

 with a golden fork instead of her fingers. But she was punished for this
 outrage upon nature: her body began to stink even while she was alive. In
 the introduction to <i>Hollinshed's</i> Chronicon, 1557, there is a bitter
 complaint that, a short time previous, so many chimneys had been erected
 in England, that so many earthen and tin dishes had been introduced in the
 place of wooden ones. Another author finds fault that oak was then used in
 building instead of willow, and adds that formerly the men were of oak but
 now of willow. <i>Slaney</i>, On rural Expenditure, 41. Compare

 Most writers who have treated of luxury at all have generally confined
 themselves to inquiring whether it was salutary or reprehensible.
 Aristippus and Antisthenes, Diogenes, etc.; Epicureans and Stoics. The
 latter were reproached with being bad citizens, because their moderation
 in all things was a hindrance to trade. (<i>Athen.</i>, IV, 163.) The
 Aristotelian <i>Herakleides</i> declared luxury to be the principal means
 to inspire men with noble-mindedness; inspired by luxury, the Athenians
 conquered at Marathon. (<i>Athen.</i>, XII, 512.) <i>Pliny</i> was one of
 the most violent opponents of luxury. See <i>Pliny</i>, N. N., XXXIII, 1,
 4, 13, and other places. The controversy has been renewed by the moderns,
 especially since the beginning of the 18th century, after luxury of every
 kind had previously (for the most part on theological grounds, but also by
 Hutten, for instance) been one-sidedly condemned. Among its defenders were
 <i>Mandeville</i>, The Fable of the Bees, 1706, who, however, calls
 everything a luxury which exceeds the baldest necessities of life;
 <i>Voltaire</i> in Le Mondain, the Apologie du Luxe, and Sur L'Usage de la
 Vie; <i>Mélon</i>, Essai politique sur le Commerce, ch. 9; <i>Hume</i>,
 Discourses, No. 2, On Refinement in the Arts; <i>Dumont</i>, Théorie du
 Luxe, 1771; <i>Filangieri</i>, Delle Leggi politiche ed economiche, II,
 37; and the majority of the Mercantile school and of the Physiocrates.
 Among the opponents of luxury, <i>J. J. Rousseau</i> towers over almost
 all others. Further, <i>Fénélon</i>, Télémaque, 1699, L. XXII;
 <i>Pinto</i>, Essai sur le Luxe, 1762.</p>
<p class="footnote">The reasons and counter-reasons advanced by those
 writers apply not only to luxury but to the lights and shades of high
 civilization in general. When a political economist declares for or
 against luxury in general, he resembles a doctor who should declare for or
 against the nerves in general. There has been luxury in every country and
 in every age. Among a healthy people, luxury is also healthy, an essential
 element in the general health of the nation. Among an unhealthy people
 luxury is a disease, and disease-engendering.</p>

<p class="center smaller">THE HISTORY OF LUXURY.—IN THE MIDDLE
AGES.</p>
<p>During the middle ages, industry and commerce had made as yet but little
progress. Hence it was as difficult then for luxury to be ministered to by
fine furniture as by the products of foreign countries. Individual
ornamental pieces, especially arms and drinking cups,<a id="fnanchor_225-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_225-1">[225-1]</a> were wont to be the only articles of <span class="pagenum">[Pg 224]</span> luxury. We have inventories of the domains
of Charlemagne from which we find that in one of them, the only articles of
linen owned were two bed-sheets, a table-cloth and a pocket handkerchief.<a id="fnanchor_225-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_225-2">[225-2]</a> Fashion is here very constant; because
clothing was comparatively dearer than at present. And so now in the East.
In the matter of dwellings, too, more regard was had to size and
durability, than to elegance and convenience. The palaces of Alfred the
Great were so frailly built that the walls had to be covered with curtains
as a protection against the wind, and the lights to be inclosed in
lanterns.<a id="fnanchor_225-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_225-3">[225-3]</a></p>
<p>Hence the disposition to use the products of the home soil as articles
of luxury was all the greater, but more as to quantity than to quality.<a id="fnanchor_225-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_225-4">[225-4]</a> Since the knight could personally neither eat
nor drink a quantity beyond the capacity of his own stomach, he kept a
numerous suite to consume his surplus. It is well known what a great part
was played among the ancient Germans by their retinues of devoted servants
(<i>comitatus</i>), which many modern writers have looked upon as
constituting the real kernel of the migration of nations.</p>
<p>In England, it was a maxim of state policy with Henry VII., whose reign
there terminated the middle age, to prohibit the <span class="pagenum">[Pg
225]</span> great liveried suites of the nobility (19 Henry VII., ch. 14)
as Richard II., Henry IV. and Edward IV. had already attempted to do. But
even under James I., we find ambassadors accompanied by a suite of 500
persons or 300 noblemen.<a id="fnanchor_225-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_225-5">[225-5]</a></p>
<p>The rich man welcomed every opportunity which enabled him to make others
share in a dazzling manner the magnitude of his superfluous wealth: hence
the numberless guests at weddings who were frequently entertained for
weeks.<a id="fnanchor_225-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_225-6">[225-6]</a> These festivities are
memorable not because of the delicacies or great variety of the dishes, but
because of their colossal magnitude. Even William of Orange, 1561,
entertained at his wedding guests who had brought with them 5,647 horses;
and he appeared himself with a suite of 1,100 men on horseback. There were
consumed on the occasion 4,000 bushels of wheat, 8,000 of rye, 11,300 of
oats, 3,600 <i>eimers</i> of wine, 1,600 barrels of beer.<a id="fnanchor_225-7"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_225-7">[225-7]</a> In the ordinance of Münden regulating <span class="pagenum">[Pg 226]</span> weddings, promulgated in the year 1610, it
is provided, that, at a large wedding there should not be over 24 tables,
nor at a small one over 14, with 10 persons at each table.<a id="fnanchor_225-8"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_225-8">[225-8]</a></p>
<p>The hospitality of the lower stages of civilization<a id="fnanchor_225-9"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_225-9">[225-9]</a> must be ascribed as well to this peculiar kind
of luxury as to mere good nature. Arabian chiefs have their noon-day table
set in the street and welcome every passer-by to it.<a id="fnanchor_225-10"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_225-10">[225-10]</a> (<i>Pococke.</i>) And so, distinguished
Indians keep an open cauldron on the fire cooking all the time, from which
every person who comes in may help himself. (<i>Catlin.</i>)</p>
<p>Compared with this luxury of the rich, the poverty found side by side
with it appears less oppressive. There is no great gap between the modes of
life of the different classes.<a id="fnanchor_225-11"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_225-11">[225-11]</a> This is the golden age of aristocracy, when no one
questions its legitimateness. When, later, the nobleman, instead of keeping
so many servants, begins to buy costly garments for himself, he, indeed,
supports indirectly just as many and even more men; but these owe him
nothing. Besides, in this last kind of luxury, it is very easily possible
for him to go beyond his means, which is scarcely ever the case in the
former.<a id="fnanchor_225-12"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_225-12">[225-12]</a></p>

 Here, as a rule, the value of the metal was greater than the form-value;
 and hence the medieval monasteries frequently made loans of silver
 vessels, where of course, the form could not be taken into consideration.
 On the other hand, in the case of the table service, presented by the king
 of Portugal to Lord Wellington, the metal cost £85,000 and the workmanship
 £86,000. (<i>Jacob</i>, Gesch. der edlen Metalle, translated by
 Kleinschrod, II, 5.) Compare <i>Hume</i>, History of England, ch. 44, App.

 Christ) 18 times its value. <i>Mommsen</i>, R. Gesch. II, 383.</p>

<i>Hume</i>, History of England, ch. 49, Append. Similarly among all
 nations which have still preserved much of the medieval. Thus the duke of
 Alba, about the end of the last century, had not a single commodious hall
 in his immense palace, but 400 rooms for his servants, since at least all
 his old servants, and even their widows and families, continued to live
 with him. In Madrid alone, he paid £1,000 a month wages to his servants;
 and the son of the duke, Medina-Celi, £4,000 per annum. (<i>Townsend</i>,
 II, 155, 158.) In many palaces in Moscow, previous to 1812, there were
 1,000 and more servants, unskillful, clad for the most part as peasants,
 badly fed, and with so little to do that perhaps one had no service to
 perform but to fetch drinking water at noon, and another in the evening.
 Even poor noblemen kept 20 and 30 servants, (<i>v. Haxthausen</i>,
 Studien, I, 59.) <i>Forster</i>, Werke, VII, 347, explains Polish luxury
 in servants, by the poorness of the servants there: a good German maid
 could do more than three Polish servants. Thus, in Jamaica, it was
 customary to exempt from the slave-tax persons who kept fewer than 7
 negroes. (<i>B. Edwards</i>, History of the W. Indies, I, 229.) Compare
 <i>Livy</i>, XXXIX, 11. The luxury of using torch-bearers instead of
 candelabra lasted until Louis XIV.'s time. (<i>Rocquefort</i>, Hist. de la

<p>The luxury of that uncivilized age shows itself for the most part on
particular occasions, and then all the more ostentatious, while in the
periods following it, it rather permeates the whole of life. Even J. Möser
excuses our forefathers for their mad celebration of their <i>kirmesses</i>

they sometimes carried it to the extent of drowning reason.<a id="fnanchor_226-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_226-1">[226-1]</a> Among ourselves, the common man drinks brandy

that, besides one enormous hall, they were wont to have very small and

Nothing can be more erroneous than to ascribe great temperance in general
to people in a low stage of civilization. Their <span class="pagenum">[Pg

<p class="center smaller">INFLUENCE OF THE CHURCH AND OF THE CITY.</p>
<p>The change in this situation takes place first of all in the churches
and in the cities. The Church has passed through almost every stage of
development in advance of the State; and civilization, both in the good and
bad sense of the term, has become general, and gradually acclimated in the
rural districts, through the influence of the cities. In the Church, the
earliest art endeavored to reach the beautiful. There, we first find music,
painting, sculpture, foreign perfumes, incense and variegated garments.<a id="fnanchor_227-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_227-1">[227-1]</a> In the cities, growing industry introduces a
more attractive style of clothing and a more ornamental style of household
furniture. Commerce, beginning to thrive, raises foreign commodities into
wants,<a id="fnanchor_227-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_227-2">[227-2]</a> and thus the old luxury of
feudal times is modified.<a id="fnanchor_227-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_227-3">[227-3]</a> The large number of idle servants is diminished. All
the more refined pleasures are extended downward to wider circles of the
people. Instead <span class="pagenum">[Pg 229]</span> of individual bards,
rhapsodists, skalds and minnesingers, we have the beginnings of the
theater, and instead of tournaments, the shooting matches.
(<i>Freischiessen.</i>)</p>
<p>But it is remarkable how much earlier here pomp and splendor are
considered than convenience. The Spanish <i>romanceros</i> of the 12th
century display wonderful splendor in their descriptions of the Cid, and
the trousseau of his daughters. But, on the other hand, the wife of Charles
VII. seems to have been the only French woman in the 15th century who had
more than two linen chemises. Even in the 16th century, it frequently
happened that a princess made a present to a prince of a single shirt. At
this time the German middle class were wont to sleep naked.<a id="fnanchor_227-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_227-4">[227-4]</a></p>
<p>Even now, half-civilized nations look more to the outward appearance of
commodities than to their intrinsic value. Thus, for instance, in Russia,
we find large numbers of porcelain services extravagantly painted and
gilded, awkward, the material of which is full of blisters; damaskeened
knives, gilt sad-irons and candle-snuffers with landscapes engraved on
them: but nothing fits into anything else; the angles are vicious, the
hinges lame, and the whole soon goes to pieces. And so, among export
merchants in Bremen, for instance, it is a rule, on all their wares
intended for America, to put a label made of very beautiful paper, with
their coat-of-arms or firm-name in real silver, and to do the packing in as
elegant a manner as possible.<a id="fnanchor_227-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_227-5">[227-5]</a> Cloths intended for America are usually

<p class="center smaller">HISTORY OF LUXURY IN HIGHLY CIVILIZED TIMES.</p>
<p>The direction which luxury takes in times when civilization is advanced,
is towards the real, healthy and tasteful enjoyment of life, rather than an
inconvenient display. This tendency is exceedingly well expressed by the
English word <i>comfort</i>, and it is in modern England that the luxury of
the second period has found it happiest development. It is found side by
side with frugality; and it frequently even looks like a return to the
unaffected love of nature.<a id="fnanchor_228-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_228-1">[228-1]</a></p>
<p>Thus, since Rousseau's time,<a id="fnanchor_228-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_228-2">[228-2]</a> the so-called English gardens have dropped the
former Versailles-Harlem style. Thus, too, modern fashion despises the
awkward long wig, powdering etc.<a id="fnanchor_228-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_228-3">[228-3]</a> Instead of garments embroidered, or faced with
fur or lace, and instead of the galloon hat worn under Louis XIV. and Louis
XV., the French revolution has introduced the simple citizen frock-coat and
the round silk hat. The "exquisite" may even with these outshine others by
the form he selects, the material he wears, or by frequent change, but
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 231]</span> much less strikingly than before.<a id="fnanchor_228-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_228-4">[228-4]</a> Since every one, in the purchase of household
furniture, etc., looks more to its use than to the honor of being sole
possessor of an article or having something in advance of everybody else,
it becomes possible for industry to manufacture its products in much larger
quantities, and after the same model, and thus to furnish a much better
article for the same price.<a id="fnanchor_228-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_228-5">[228-5]</a> Besides, more recent industry has produced a
multitude of cheap substitutes for costly objects of luxury: plated
silver-leafing, cotton-velvet goods, etc.;<a id="fnanchor_228-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_228-6">[228-6]</a> besides the many steel engravings, lithographs

 It will always remain a want to own clothes for every day wear and festal
 occasions. The frock coat satisfies this want in the cheapest way. As soon

 The most frightful uncleanliness prevails among the inhabitants of polar
 countries, who never bathe, because of the climate, avoid all ventilation,
 and because of the leathern clothing which they smear with grease, etc.
 The Tunguses consider the after-birth cooked or roasted as a great
 delicacy. "Fathers and mothers wipe their children's<a id="fnanchor_TN51"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN51">[TN 51]</a> noses with their mouth, and gulp the secretion
 down." (<i>Georgi</i>, Beschreib. aller Nationen des russ. Reiches, I,

 water. (loc. cit., I, 349, 353.) Compare <i>Klemm</i>, Kulturgeschichte,
 III, 24, 57. In warmer climates, even less civilized nations are clean,
 for instance in the East and South-Sea Islands, etc. All the more
 surprising is the uncleanliness of the Hottentots and Bushmen, where the
 natural color is observable only under the eyes, where the tears produced
 by too much smoke has washed away the crust of dirt which, with this
 exception, covers the whole body. (<i>Klemm</i>, Kulturgeschichte, 333.)
 How long it takes for cleanliness to become a national trait, may be
 inferred from the history of water-closets, when, for instance, their
 introduction into every house during the 16th and even the 17th century,
 had to be provided for by law in Paris. (<i>Beckmann</i>, Beiträge, II,
 358 ff.) The Göttingen statutes of 1342 had to expressly prohibit persons
 to <i>merdare</i> in public wine-cellars where persons ate and drank
 together. (<i>Spittler</i>, Gesch. Hannovers, I, 57.) Similarly in the
 courts of the German princes. On the other hand, universality of
 water-closets in England to-day.</p>

40; in 1764, 39; in 1791, 37; in 1811, 42; in 1818, 45; in 1839, 60 per
cent.<a id="fnanchor_229-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_229-2">[229-2]</a> About 1758, in England
and Wales, 3,750,000 of people lived on wheat bread; on barley bread,
739,000; on rye bread, 888,000; on oat bread, 623,000. The cultured
southeastern population had almost nothing but wheat bread, while in the
north and northwest, oat bread continued to be used a long time; and in
Wales only 10 per cent. of the population ate wheat bread. This condition
of things in England has since been much improved. But, at the extremities
of the Hebrides, nine-tenths of the population still live on barley bread;
and in Ireland it was estimated, in 1838, that with 8,000,000 inhabitants,
potatoes were the chief article of food of 5,000,000, and oat bread of
2,500,000.<a id="fnanchor_229-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_229-3">[229-3]</a></p>

cities is uniformly much larger than in the country. In the cities of the
Prussian monarchy and subject to the slaughter-house tax, it amounted in
1846, per capita: in East Prussia, to 61 lbs.; in Pommerania, to 66; in
Posen, to 70; in West Prussia, to 71; in Saxony, to 75; in the Rhine
Province, to 83; in Silesia, to 86; in Brandenburg, to nearly 104; in
Berlin alone, to 114: an average in the whole country, however, of scarcely
40 lbs. per capita. (<i>Dietrici.</i>) In the kingdom of Saxony, the
average consumption of beef and pork was, shortly before 1866, about 50
lbs.; in Dresden alone, 86.7; in Leipzig, 136.9 lbs.<a id="fnanchor_229-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_229-4">[229-4]</a> The consumption of meat in England is
exceedingly great, so that, for instance, in several orphan asylums in
London, the daily meat ration amounts to an average of from 0.23 to 0.438
lbs. The meat-consumption of a well-to-do family, children and servants

of sugar per capita was scarcely over 8 lbs.<a id="fnanchor_229-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_229-6">[229-6]</a> In the German Zollverein, the consumption of sugar,

than 9 lbs. In France, the consumption of the same article rose from 1.33

<p>A great many of vegetables and fruits, which seem to us to be almost
indispensable articles of subsistence, have been cultivated <span class="pagenum">[Pg 237]</span> only a short time. Thus the English have

<p>The per capita consumption of wool in England, about a generation ago,
amounted to about 4 lbs. a year; in Prussia to 1.67; of cloth, to 5.76 and

 The food of the French people has improved also in point of quantity. At
 the beginning of the eighteenth century, of cereals there were 472 liters
 per capita, at present there are 541 liters; and in addition, now, 240
 liters of potatoes and vegetables more than then. Compare <i>Moreau de

 About the middle of the 13th century, only from 11 to 12 <i>malters</i> of
 wheat were produced on the estates of the bishop of Osnabrück; about 470
 of oats, 300 of rye, and 120 of barley. (<i>J. Möser</i>, Osnabrück,

 part of the middle ages. (<i>Guérard</i>, Polyptiques, I, 710 ff.) The
 ancients, also, in their lower stages of civilization, lived on barley
 bread by way of preference, and went over to wheat only at a later period;

 To this, in Saxony, must be added about from 6 to 7 pounds of veal and
 mutton. The recent increase in the consumption of meat in Saxony is very
 encouraging: 1840, about 30 lbs. of beef and pork per capita; 1851-57, 40
 lbs. (Sächs. Statist. Ztschr., 1867, 143 seq.) On the other hand,
 <i>Schmoller</i> estimated the consumption of meat in general in Prussia,
 in 1802, at 33.8; in 1816, at 22.5; in 1840, at 34.6; in 1867, at 34.9
 lbs. (<i>Fühling</i>, N. Landw. Zeitg., XIX; Jahrg. Heft., 9 seq.) Paris
 consumed, in 1850, 145 pounds of butcher's meat per capita; in 1869, 194
 pounds. In the year of the revolution, 1848, the consumption declined 45
 per cent.; the consumption of wine in barrels, 16 per cent.; in bottles,
 44 per cent.; of sea-fish, 25 per cent.; of oysters, 24 per cent.; of

 million. On the other hand, consumption, when the average from 1816 to
 1819 is compared with that from 1824 to 1828, increased in a much greater
 proportion: soap, from 67¾ to 100 million pounds; coffee, from 7,850,000
 to 12,540,000 pounds; starch, from 3-1/5 to 6-1/3 million pounds. (Quart.
 Rev., Nov., 1829, 518.) The consumption of tea per capita in 1801 was 1.5
 lbs., in 1871, 3.93 lbs. (Statist. Journ., 1872, 243.) In the matter of
 illumination, a very beneficent luxury has been obtained, inasmuch as,
 spite of the fact that gas-light is so generally used in recent times, i.
 e., since 1804, the consumption of oil has very much increased, on account
 of the lamps now so much in favor; and that of candles also has increased,
 relatively speaking, more rapidly than the population. The illumination
 produced is much richer now than formerly, a fact which, besides its
 sanitary advantages, has had a good influence in diminishing street
 robberies. (<i>Julius</i>, Gefängnisskunde, XXII.) During the middle ages,
 candles were very dear; according to <i>Rogers</i> (I, 415) 1-1/3 to 2
 shillings per pound.</p>

<p class="center smaller">EQUALIZING TENDENCY OF LATER LUXURY.</p>
<p>The whole social character of this luxury has something equalizing<a id="fnanchor_230-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_230-1">[230-1]</a> in it; but it supposes particularly that there
is not too marked a difference in the resources of the people.</p>
<p>A proper gradation of national wants is best guarantied by a good
distribution of the national resources.<a id="fnanchor_230-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_230-2">[230-2]</a> The more unequal the latter is, the more is there
spent on vain wants instead of on real ones; and the more numerous are the
instances of rapid and even immoral consumption. Where there are only a few
over-rich men, more foreign products and products <span class="pagenum">[Pg
238]</span> of capital are wont to be called for than home products and
productions of labor; and luxury especially despises all those commodities
manufactured in large institutions.<a id="fnanchor_230-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_230-3">[230-3]</a> Every change in the consumption-customs of a people,
in this respect, should be most carefully observed; thus, for instance,
whether brandy is exchanged for beer, tobacco for meat, cotton for cloth,
or the reverse.<a id="fnanchor_230-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_230-4">[230-4]</a></p>
<p>One of the characteristics of this period is the endeavor to possess the
best quality of whatever is possessed at all, and to be satisfied with less
of it rather than purchase more of an inferior quality. This is,
essentially, to practice frugality, inasmuch as certain production-services
remain the same whether the commodity is of the best or the worst quality,
and that commodities of the best quality are more superior to the worst in
intrinsic goodness than they are in price. But this course supposes a
certain well-being already existing.</p>
<p>In this period, also, the luxury of the state is wont to take the
direction of those enjoyments which are accessible to all.<a id="fnanchor_230-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_230-5">[230-5]</a></p>

 nabobs were the only persons who created any demand for European
 commodities (312 ff.). <i>Adam Smith</i>, Wealth of Nat., II, ch. 3, draws
 a very correct distinction between the luxury of durable goods and that of
 those which perish rapidly; the former is less calculated to impoverish an
 individual or a whole nation; and hence it is much more closely allied to
 frugality. Similarly even <i>Isocrates</i>, ad Niccol., 19; <i>Livy</i>,

 consumption of brandy in England decreased from 1854 and 1870, from 1.13
 to 1.01 gallons per capita; but, on the other hand, the consumption of
 malt increased from 1.45 to 1.84 bushels, and the consumption of wine from

<p class="center smaller">THE ADVANTAGES OF LUXURY.</p>
<p>The favorable results which many writers ascribe to luxury in general
are true evidently only of this period. And thus luxury, inasmuch as it is
a spur to emulation, promotes production in general; just as the awarding
of prizes in a school, although they can be carried away only by a few,
excites the activity of all its attendants. A nation which begins to
consume sugar will, as a rule, unless it surrenders some previous
enjoyment, increase its production.<a id="fnanchor_231-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_231-1">[231-1]</a>
In countries where there is little or no legal security, in which,
therefore, people must keep shy of making public the good condition they
are in, this praise-worthy side of luxury is for the most part wanting.<a id="fnanchor_231-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_231-2">[231-2]</a></p>
<p>All rational luxury constitutes a species of reserve fund for <span class="pagenum">[Pg 240]</span> a future day of need. This is especially
true of these luxuries which take the form of capital in use
(<i>Nutzkapitalien</i>.) Where it is customary for every peasant girl to
wear a gold head-dress,<a id="fnanchor_231-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_231-3">[231-3]</a> and every apprentice a
medal, a penny for a rainy day is always laid by among the lower classes.
The luxury which is rapidly consumed has a tendency in the same direction.
Where the majority of the population live on potatoes, as in Ireland,
where, therefore, they are reduced to the smallest allowance of the means
of subsistence, there is no refuge in case of a bad harvest. A people on
the other hand, who live on wheat bread may go over to rye bread, and a
people who live on rye bread to potatoes. The corn that in good years is
consumed in the making of brandy may, in bad years, be baked into bread.<a id="fnanchor_231-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_231-4">[231-4]</a> And the oats consumed by horses kept as
luxuries may serve as food for man. Pleasure-gardens (<i>Lustgärten</i>)
may be considered as a kind of last resort for a whole people in case of
want of land.<a id="fnanchor_231-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_231-5">[231-5]</a> <a id="fnanchor_231-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_231-6">[231-6]</a></p>

<p>In declining nations, luxury assumes an imprudent and immoral character.
Enormous sums are expended for insignificant enjoyments. It may even be
said that costly consumption is carried on there for its own sake. The
beautiful and the true enjoyment of life makes place for the monstrous and
the effeminate.</p>
<p>Rome, in the earlier part of the empire, affords us an example of such
luxury on the most extensive scale.<a id="fnanchor_232-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_232-1">[232-1]</a> Nero paid three hundred talents for a murrhine vase.
The two acres (<i>Morgen</i>) of land which sufficed to the ancient
citizens for a farm (<i>Acker</i>) were not now enough to make a fish-pond
for imperial slaves. The sums carried by the exiles with them, to cover
their traveling expenses and to live on for a time, were now greater than
the fortunes of the most distinguished citizens had been in former times.<a id="fnanchor_232-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_232-2">[232-2]</a> There was such a struggle among the people to
surpass one another in procuring the freshest sea-fish that, at last, they
would taste only such as they had seen alive on the table. We have the most
exalted descriptions of the beautiful changes of color undergone by the
dying fish; and a special infusion was invented to enable the epicure
better to enjoy the spectacle.<a id="fnanchor_232-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_232-3">[232-3]</a> Of the transparent garments of his time, Seneca says
that they neither protected the body nor covered the nakedness of nature.
People kept herds of sheep dyed in purple, although their natural white
must have been much more agreeable to <span class="pagenum">[Pg 242]</span>
any one with an eye for the tasteful.<a id="fnanchor_232-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_232-4">[232-4]</a> Not only on the roofs of houses were fish-ponds to
be seen, but gardens even hanging on towers, and which must have been as
small, ugly and inconvenient as they were costly.<a id="fnanchor_232-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_232-5">[232-5]</a> Especially characteristic of the time was the custom
of dissolving pearls in wine, not to make it more palatable,<a id="fnanchor_TN54"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN54">[TN 54]</a> but more expensive.<a id="fnanchor_232-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_232-6">[232-6]</a> The emperor Caligula, from simple caprice, caused
mountains to be built up and cut away: <i>nihil tam efficere concupiscebat,
quam, quod posse effici negaretur</i>.<a id="fnanchor_232-7"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_232-7">[232-7]</a> This is the real maxim of the third period of
luxury! People changed their dress at table, inconvenient as it was to do
so, occasionally as often as eleven times. Perfumes were mixed with the
wine that was drunk, much as it spoiled its taste, only that the drinkers
might emit sweet odors from every pore. There were many so used to being
waited on by slaves that they required to be reminded by them at what times
they should eat and when they should sleep. It is related of one who
affected superiority over others in this respect, that he was carried from
his bath and placed on a cushion, when he asked his attendant: "Am I
sitting down now?"<a id="fnanchor_232-8"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_232-8">[232-8]</a> It is no wonder,
indeed, that an Apicius should reach out for the poisoned cup when his
fortune had dwindled to only <i>centies sestertium</i>, <i>i. e.</i>, to
more than half a million thalers.<a id="fnanchor_232-9"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_232-9">[232-9]</a></p>
<p>In this last period, the coarse debauchery of the earlier periods is
added to the refined. Swarms of servants, retinues <span class="pagenum">[Pg 243]</span> of gladiators who might be even politically
dangerous,<a id="fnanchor_232-10"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_232-10">[232-10]</a> monster banquets, at which
Cæsar, for instance, entertained the whole Roman people, colossal palaces
such as Nero's <i>aurea domus</i>, which constituted a real city; annoying
ostentation in dress<a id="fnanchor_232-11"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_232-11">[232-11]</a> again becomes the
order of the day. The more despotic a state becomes, the more is the
craving for momentary enjoyment wont to grow; and for the same reason that
great plagues diminish frugality and morality.<a id="fnanchor_232-12"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_232-12">[232-12]</a></p>

<p>Sumptuary laws (<i>die Luxusgesetzgebung</i>) have been aimed, at all
times, principally at the outlay for clothing, for the table and for
funerals.<a id="fnanchor_233-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_233-1">[233-1]</a> In most nations the
policy of luxury <span class="pagenum">[Pg 244]</span> has its beginning in
the transition from the first to the second period of luxury above
described.<a id="fnanchor_233-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_233-2">[233-2]</a> The extravagant feasts,
which remain of the first period, seem vulgar to the new public opinion
which is created. On the other hand, the conveniences of life, the
universality, the refinement and variety of enjoyments characteristic of
the second period are not acceptable to the austerity of old men, and are
put down as effeminacy. In this period the bourgeoisie generally begin to
rise in importance, and the feudal aristocracy to decay. The higher classes
see the lower approximate to them in display, with jealous eyes. And,
hence, dress is wont to be graded in strict accordance with the differences
of class.<a id="fnanchor_233-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_233-3">[233-3]</a> But these <span class="pagenum">[Pg 245]</span> laws must be regarded as emanating from the
tendency, which prevails in these times, of the state to act as the
guardian of its wards, its subjects. The authority of the state waxes
strong in such periods; and with the first consciousness of its power, it
seeks to draw many things into its sphere, which it afterwards
surrenders.</p>

<a href="#fnanchor_233-1" class="pginternal">[233-1]</a>
 Which of these three kinds of luxury specially preponderated has always
 depended on the peculiarities of national character. Thus, among the
 ancient Romans, it was the second; among the French, the first. In Germany
 the prohibitions relating to "toasts," or drinking one another's health
 have played a great part. Thus the well-known Cologne reformation of 1837.

 In Greece, <i>Lycurgus'</i> legislation seems to have contained the first
 prohibition relating to luxury. No one should own a house or household
 article which had been made with a finer implement than an ax or a saw;
 and no Spartan cook should use any other spice than salt and vinegar.
 (<i>Plut.</i>, De Sanitate, 12; <i>Lycurg.</i>, 13. On Periander, see
 <i>Ephorus</i>, ed. <i>Marx</i>, fr. 106. <i>Heracb.</i>, Pont. ed.;
 <i>Köhler</i>, fr. 5; <i>Diog. Laert.</i>, I, 96 ff.) The
 luxury-prohibitions of Solon were aimed especially at the female passion
 for dress and the pomp of funerals. Those who had the surveillance of the
 sex watched also over the luxury of banquets. <i>Athen.</i>, VI, 245;
 <i>Demosth.</i> in <i>Macart.</i>, 1070. In Rome, there were laws
 regulating the pomp of and display at funerals, dating from the time of
 the Kings; but especially are such laws to be found in the twelve tables.
 Lex Oppia de Cultu Mulierum in the year 215 before Christ. A very
 interesting debate concerning the abolition of this law in <i>Livy</i>,

 funerals and games of chance, constitute an important part of Sulla's
 legislation.</p>

<i>Latus clavus</i> of the Roman senators; <i>annulus</i> of the knights.
 In the latter middle age, the knights were wont to be allowed to wear
 gold, and esquires only silver; the former, damask; the latter, satin or
 taffeta; but when the esquires also used damask, velvet was reserved for
 the knights alone. <i>St. Palaye</i>, Das Ritterwesen, by <i>Klüber</i>,
 IV, 107; II, 153 seq. But towards the end of the middle ages many
 sumptuary laws were enacted in cities by plebeian jealousy of the rich.
 The Venetian sumptuary laws were passed on account of the anxiety of the
 state that some rich men might shine above the rest of the oligarchs.</p>
<p class="p2 center"><a id="S234"></a>SECTION CCXXXIV.</p>
<p class="center smaller">HISTORY OF SUMPTUARY LAWS.</p>
<p>As in Italy, Frederick II., in Aragon, Iago I., in 1234, in England,
Edward III., by 37, Edward III., c. 8 ff., so in France Philip IV. was the
first who busied himself seriously with sumptuary legislation;<a id="fnanchor_234-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_234-1">[234-1]</a> that is the same king who had introduced in so
many things the modern political life into France. (For instance, the
ordinance of 1294, regulating apparel and the luxury of the table.) In the
14th century, we find sumptuary laws directed mainly against expense for
furs, and in the 16th mainly against that for articles of gold and silver.
From the descriptions left us in such laws of the prohibited luxuries, we
may learn as much of the history of technology and of fashion, as we may of
the history of classes from the gradation of the things permitted. The
fines imposed for violations of these laws, under Philip IV. went for the
most part to the territorial lord; and in the 16th and 17th centuries to
the foundation of charitable institutions. The state, as a rule, took no
share of them; doubtless to avoid the odium which might attach to this kind
of revenue.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 246]</span>Beginning with the end of the 16th
century, the sumptuary laws of France relating to the luxuries permitted to
the several classes of the people disappear. The legislator ceases to be
guided by moral considerations and begins to be influenced by reasons
partaking of a commercial and police character; and here we may very
clearly demonstrate the origin of the so-called mercantile or protective
system. Thus, in the declaration of Louis XIV. dated December 12, 1644, we
find a complaint, that not only does the importation of foreign articles of
luxury threaten to rob France of all its gold and silver, but also that the
home manufacture of gold cloth, etc., which at Lyons alone ate up 10,000
livres a week, had the same effect. Under Colbert, in 1672, it was
specially provided for, in the prohibition of coarser silver ware, that all
such ware should be brought to the mint.<a id="fnanchor_234-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_234-2">[234-2]</a> In the edict of 1660, the king even says that he has
in view especially the higher classes, officers, courtiers, etc., in whom
it was his duty to be most deeply interested. To preserve the latter from
impoverishment was the main object of the law.</p>
<p>Under Louis XV. all sumptuary laws were practically a dead letter.<a id="fnanchor_234-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_234-3">[234-3]</a> Their enforcement is, indeed, exceedingly
difficult, <span class="pagenum">[Pg 247]</span> as it is always harder to
superintend consumption than production. The latter is carried on in
definite localities, not unfrequently even in the open air. The former is
carried on in the secrecy of a thousand homes. Besides, sumptuary laws have
very often the effect to make the forbidden fruit all the sweeter. Where
they are based on a difference of class, not only the passion for pleasure,
but the vanity of the lower classes is an incentive to their violation.<a id="fnanchor_234-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_234-4">[234-4]</a> Spite of the severity of the penalties
attached to the violation of these laws, of redoubled measures of control,
which are dreadful burdens on the intercourse between man and man,<a id="fnanchor_234-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_234-5">[234-5]</a> the French government has been compelled to
admit, after almost every internal commotion, and almost every external
war, that its sumptuary laws fell into disuse.</p>

 Prussia in 1269. (<i>Voigt</i>, Gesch. von Preussen, V, 97.) On Henry II.,
 see <i>v. Raumer</i>, Hohenstaufen, VI, 585. Some of the earlier
 restrictions on luxury, such as that of 190 in England and France, against
 scarlet ermine, etc., may have been related to the religious fervor of the
 crusades. <i>St. Louis</i>, during the whole period of his crusades wore
 no articles of luxury.</p>

<a href="#fnanchor_234-2" class="pginternal">[234-2]</a>
 The English prohibition against the wearing of silk on hats, caps,
 stockings etc. (1 and 2 Phil. and Mary, ch. 2.) was promulgated with the
 intention of promoting the home manufacture of wool. And so <i>Sully</i>,
 Economics, L, XII, XVI, was in favor of laws regulating outlay mainly from
 "mercantilistic" reasons, that the country might not be impoverished by
 the purchase of foreign expensive articles. The police ordinance of the
 Empire of 1548, tit. 9, desired to guard against both the "excessive"
 exportation of money and the obliteration of class differences; that of
 1530, tit. 9, and the Austrian police ordinance of Ferdinand I. had only
 the second object in view. (<i>Mailath</i>, Gesch., von Oesterreich, II,
 169 ff.) How, in Denmark, prohibitions of luxury grew very soon into
 prohibitions of imports with a protective intention, see in
 <i>Thaarup</i>, Dänische Statistik, I, 521 seq. On the mercantilistic
 object of the greater number of prohibitions of coffee, in the 18th
 century, see <i>Dohm</i>, über Kaffeegesetzgebung, in the D. Museum, Bd.,

 Britain, the Scotch luxury-law of 1621 is the last. (<i>Anderson</i>,

 the end of the 18th century; and the laws regulating mourning have lasted
 longest. Compare that of Frederick the Great of 1777, the Bamberg and
 Wurzberg laws of 1784, in <i>Schlözer</i>, Staatsanzeigen, IX, 460; fol.
 141 ff. There are many men who have no desire to go to any heavy expense
 in mourning, but do not dare to give expression thereto in certain cases,
 and therefore look with favor on a law to which they may appeal as an<a id="fnanchor_TN55"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN55">[TN 55]</a> excuse.</p>

 Compare especially the French sumptuary law of 1567. Zaleucos went so far
 in his severity as to punish with death the drinking of unmixed wine,
 without the prescription of a physician. (<i>Athen.</i>, IX, 429.) The
 effort has sometimes been made to enlist the feeling of honor of the
 people in the controlling of luxury. Thus old Zaleucos forbade the wearing
 of gold rings or Milesian cloth unless the wearer desired to commit
 adultery, or to be guilty of sins against nature (<i>Diodor.</i>, XII,
 21); but such laws are scarcely attended with success.</p>
<p class="p2 center"><a id="S235"></a>SECTION CCXXXV.</p>
<p class="center smaller">DIFFICULTY OF ENFORCING SUMPTUARY LAWS.</p>
<p>The impossibility of enforcing sumptuary laws has been most strikingly
observed, where it has been attempted to suppress the consumption of
popular delicacies in the first stages <span class="pagenum">[Pg
248]</span> of their spread among the people. Thus, an effort was made in
this direction in the sixteenth century, as regards brandy; in the
seventeenth, as regards tobacco; in the eighteenth, as regards coffee; all
which three articles were first allowed to be used only as medicines.<a id="fnanchor_235-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_235-1">[235-1]</a> When governments discovered after some time
the fruitlessness of the efforts, they gave up the prohibition of these
luxuries and substituted taxes on them instead.<a id="fnanchor_TN56"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN56">[TN 56]</a>
<a id="fnanchor_235-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_235-2">[235-2]</a> Thus an effort was made to combine a moral and
a fiscal end. But it should not be lost sight of that the lower these taxes
are, the greater the revenue they bring in; that is, the less the moral end
is attained, the more is the fiscal end. Even Cato took this course. His
office of censor, which united the highest moral superintendence with the
highest financial guidance, must of itself have led him in this
direction.<a id="fnanchor_235-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_235-3">[235-3]</a> In modern times the most
important excises and financial duties of entry have been evolved out of
sumptuary laws. Even the Turks, after having long tried to prohibit
tobacco-smoking in vain, afterwards found in the duties they imposed on
that plant a rich source of income. That such taxes are among the best
imposed, where they do not lead to frauds on the government, <span class="pagenum">[Pg 249]</span> become excessive, or diminish consumption
to too great an extent, is universally conceded.</p>
<p>Beyond this there is, on the whole, little left of the old police
regulations relating to luxury. Thus, governmental consent is, in most
countries, required for the establishment of places where liquors are sold
at retail, for the maintenance of public places of amusement, for shooting
festivals, fairs, etc.; and this consent should not be too freely granted.
The police power prescribes certain hours at which drinking places shall be
closed. Games of chance are wont to be either entirely prohibited or
restricted to certain places and times (bathing places), or are reserved as
the exclusive right of certain institutions, especially state institutions.
The object of this is, on the one hand, to facilitate their supervision,
and on the other, to diminish the number of seductive occasions. Here, too,
belongs the appointment of guardians to spendthrifts, which is generally
done on the motion of the family by the courts; but which, indeed, occurs
too seldom to have any great influence on the national resources, or on
national morals.<a id="fnanchor_235-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_235-4">[235-4]</a></p>

 tobacco laws of 1604; <i>Rymer</i>, Fœdera, XVI, 601. Papal
 excommunication fulminated in 1624, against all who took snuff in church,

 prohibiting smoking under penalty of death. In Switzerland, even in the
 17th century, no one could smoke except in secret. Coffee had a hard
 struggle even in its native place. (<i>Ritter</i>, Erdkunde, XIII, 574

 funeral-luxuries, at an earlier date. (<i>Cicero</i>, ad. Att., XII,

<p class="center smaller">EXPEDIENCY OF SUMPTUARY LAWS.</p>
<p>To judge of the salutariness of sumptuary laws, we must keep the above
three social periods in view throughout. At the close of the first period,
every law which restricts the excesses of the immediately succeeding age
(the middle age) is useful because it promotes the noble luxury of the
second <span class="pagenum">[Pg 250]</span> period.<a id="fnanchor_236-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_236-1">[236-1]</a> And so, in the third period, legislation may
at least operate to drive the most immoral and most odious forms of vice
under cover, and thus to diminish their contagious seduction. It is a
matter of significance that, in Rome, the most estimable of the emperors
always endeavored to restrict luxury.<a id="fnanchor_236-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_236-2">[236-2]</a> But too much should not be expected of such laws.
<i>Intra animum medendum est; nos pudor in melius mutet.</i><a id="fnanchor_236-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_236-3">[236-3]</a> It is at least necessary, that the example
given in high places should lend its positive aid, as did that of
Vespasian, for instance, who thus really opposed a certain barrier to the
disastrous flood of Roman luxury.<a id="fnanchor_236-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_236-4">[236-4]</a></p>

has to be extirpated, the people can use the knife themselves. I need call
attention only to the temperance societies of modern times (Boston, 1803),
which spite of all their exaggeration<a id="fnanchor_236-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_236-6">[236-6]</a> may have a very <span class="pagenum">[Pg
251]</span> beneficial effect on the morally weak by the solemn nature of
the pledge, and the control their members mutually exercise over one
another. It is estimated that, of all who enter them, in the British
Empire, at least 50 per cent. remain true to the pledge. In Ireland the
government had endeavored for a long time to preserve the country from the
ravages of alcohol by the imposition of the highest taxes and the severest
penalties for smuggling. Every workman in an illegal distillery was
transported for seven years, and every town in which such a one was found
was subjected to a heavy fine. But all in vain. Only numberless acts of
violence were now added to beastly drunkenness. On the other hand, the
temperance societies of the country decreased the consumption of brandy
between 1838 and 1842, from 12,296,000 gallons to 5,290,000 gallons. The
excise on brandy decreased £750,000; but many other taxable articles
yielded so much larger a revenue, that the aggregate government income
there increased about £91,000.<a id="fnanchor_236-7"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_236-7">[236-7]</a> <a id="fnanchor_236-8"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_236-8">[236-8]</a> <span class="pagenum">[Pg 252]</span> The Puritanical laws which some of the

 15th century. The outlay for dress, for the table, for servants and

 unrestricted for churches, palaces, libraries, and works of art. The
 consequences of this legislation are felt even in our day.

 While, formerly, they cared only to abstain from spirits, the so-called
 "total abstinence" has prevailed since 1832. Most teetotallers compare
 moderate drinking to moderate lying or moderate stealing; they even
 declare the moderate drinker worse than the drunkard, because his example
 is more apt to lead others astray, and he is harder to convert. (But,

 Recently, the first enthusiasm awakened by Father Matthew has somewhat

 31,400,000; although the population had in the meantime increased from 10
 to 11 per cent. In 1834, there were in the United States 7,000 temperance
 societies with a membership of 1,250,000. The members of these societies
 are sometimes paid higher wages in factories; and ships which allow no
 alcohol on board are insured at a premium of five per cent. less.

 A severe system of house-searching, imprisonment and inquisitorial
 proceedings in order to enforce the law. Similarly in Vermont, Rhode
 Island, Massachusetts and Michigan. (Edinburg Rev., July, 1854.) There
 are, however, numberless instances related in which the law has been
 violated unpunished since 1856, and still more since 1872. See <i>R.

 From the foregoing, it is intelligible why most modern writers, even those
 otherwise opposed to luxury, are not favorably inclined towards sumptuary
 laws. "It is the highest impertinence and presumption in kings and
 ministers, to pretend to watch over the economy of private people and to
 restrain their expense, either by sumptuary laws or by prohibiting the
 importation of foreign luxuries. They are themselves always, and without
 any exception (?) the greatest spendthrifts in the society. If their own
 extravagance does not ruin the state, that of their subjects never will."
 (<i>Adam Smith</i>, I, ch. 3.) Compare <i>Rau</i>, Lehrbuch II, § 358 ff.
 <i>R. Mohl</i>, Polizeiwissenschaft, II, 434 ff.</p>
<p class="footnote"><i>Montesquieu's</i> opinion that in monarchies luxury
 is necessary to preserve the difference of class but that in republics it
 is a cause of decline, is very peculiar. In the latter, therefore, luxury
 should be restricted in every way: agrarian laws should modify the too
 great difference in property and sumptuary laws restrain the too glaring
 manifestations of extravagance. (Esprit des Lois, VII, 4.) As an auxiliary
 to the history of sumptuary laws, compare <i>Boxmann</i>, De Legibus

<h3>INSURANCE IN GENERAL.</h3>
<p class="p2 center"><a id="S237"></a>SECTION CCXXXVII.</p>
<p class="center smaller">INSURANCE IN GENERAL.</p>
<p>The idea of societies for mutual assistance intended to divide the loss
caused by destructive accidents which one person would not be able to
recover from among a great many is very ancient. The insurance of their
members against causes of impoverishment was one of the principal
elements<a id="fnanchor_237-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_237-1">[237-1]</a> of the strength of the
medieval communities (<i>Gemeinden und Körperschaften.</i>) If we compare
these insurance institutions of the middle ages with those of the present,
we discover the well-known difference between a <i>corporation</i> and an
<i>association</i>. There the members stand to one another in the relation
of <i>persons</i> who, therefore, seek to guaranty their entire life in the
one combination; here, they appear only as the representatives of limited
portions of capital confronted with a definite <span class="pagenum">[Pg
254]</span> risk, the average of which may be accurately determined. Hence,
the former are of small extent, mostly local; the latter may extend over
whole continents, and even over the whole earth. The former have uniformly
equal members; the latter embrace men of the most different classes. While
the former, therefore, simply govern themselves, often only on the occasion
of their festive gatherings, the latter need a precise charter, an
artificial tariff and a board of officers.</p>
<p>As the absolute monarchical police-state constitutes, generally, the
bridge between the middle ages and modern times, so too the transition from
the medieval to the modern system of insurance has been frequently
introduced by state insurance.<a id="fnanchor_237-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_237-2">[237-2]</a> <a id="fnanchor_237-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_237-3">[237-3]</a> This was very natural at a time when the guilds of
the middle ages had lost their importance, and private industry was not
ripe enough to supply the void left by them. The government of a country,
far in advance intellectually of the majority of its subjects, may, by
force, induce them to participate in the beneficent effects of insurance,
and immediately provide institutions extensive enough to guaranty real
safety. While it may be called a rule that mature private industry <span class="pagenum">[Pg 255]</span> satisfies wants more rapidly, in greater
variety, and more cheaply than state industry; in the case of insurance
against accidents, especially of insurance against fire, there are many
peculiarities found which would make the entire cessation of the immediate
action of the state in this sphere, or its limitation simply to a
legislative and police supervision of insurance, seem a misfortune. A
dwelling is one of the most universal and urgent of wants, and indeed a
governing one in all the rest of the arrangements of life. If it be
destroyed, it is especially difficult to find a substitute for it, or to
restore it. And to the poorest class of those who need insurance, private
insurance will, perhaps, be never properly accessible.<a id="fnanchor_237-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_237-4">[237-4]</a> If German fire insurance and the German system
of fire prevention be so superior to the English and North American, etc.,

 The Icelandic <i>repps</i> consisting as a rule of 20 citizens subject to
 taxation, who mutually insured one another against the death of cattle (to
 the extent of at least one-fourth the value), and against damage from
 fire. After every fire three chambers of each house were replaced; so also
 the loss of clothing and of the means of subsistence, but not other goods
 or articles of display. (<i>Dahlmann</i>, Danisch Gesch., II, 281 ff.)

 (<i>Beckmann</i>, Beitr. zur Gesch. der Erfind, I, 219 ff.) The idea
 sometimes suggested in our day, of making the system of insurance a

 In Berlin, in 1871, the movable property of 30.4 per cent. of all
 dwellings was insured; but with this great difference, that of the
 smallest (without any heatable rooms) only 5.3 per cent. were insured;
 while of dwellings having 5-7 heatable rooms, 84 per cent. had taken this
 precaution. (<i>Schwabe</i>, Volkszahlung von 1871, 169) But it should not
 be forgotten that private insurance, especially when speculative, is not
 in favor of having much to do with persons of small means, while public
 institutions are, for the most part, obliged to reject no proposition for
 insurance in their own line, except when coming from a few manufacturing
 quarters especially exposed to fire.</p>

 Outside of Germany, public fire insurance is to be still found only in
 German Austria, in Denmark, Switzerland and Scandinavia. The Germans had,
 in 1871, an insurance-sum of 5,908,760,000 thalers, while the mutual
 private insurance companies had about 1,435,000,000 (of which, at most,
 200,000,000 to 300,000,000 were on immovable property), and joint-stock
 insurance companies, after deducting re-insurance
 (<i>Rückversicherung</i>), about 7,000,000,000. (Mittheilungen der öff. F.
 V. Anstalten, 1874, 84 ff.) Between 1865 and 1870, it was estimated that
 the per capita insurance of the population was: in Saxony, 407 thalers; in
 Würtemberg, 410; in Baden, 365; in Prussia, 332; in Switzerland, 425. On
 the other hand, in the much wealthier British Empire, only 325 per capita;
 in North America, 215. (loc. cit., 92.) Even in the case of joint-stock
 insurance companies, the average receipts of premiums (1867-70) were, in
 Germany, 2 per 1,000 of the insurance-sums; in the United Kingdom, 4.06
 per 1,000; in the United States, 10.77; and the damage respectively 1.25,
 2.28, 5.92 per 1,000 of the insurance-sum. (loc. cit., 93.)</p>

<p>INSURANCE IN GENERAL.—MUTUAL AND SPECULATIVE INSTITUTIONS.</p>
<p>All insurance institutions fall into two classes:</p>
<p>A. Mutual insurance companies, in which the insured are
also as a society the insurers, and share the aggregate damage,
of a year, for instance, among themselves.</p>
<p>B. Speculative institutions, in which a party, generally a joint-stock
company, in consideration of a certain definite compensation (premium
agreed upon and paid in advance), assumes the risk.<a id="fnanchor_237a-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_237a-1">[237a-1]</a></p>
<p>So far as security is concerned, no absolute preference can be accorded
to either of these classes. Mutual insurance companies require to extend
their business very largely<a id="fnanchor_237a-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_237a-2">[237a-2]</a> to be able to meet great damage. And even where the
liability of the members is unlimited, care must be taken to distinguish
between the legally and the actually possible.<a id="fnanchor_237a-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_237a-3">[237a-3]</a> The joint capital of a well <span class="pagenum">[Pg 257]</span> organized<a id="fnanchor_237a-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_237a-4">[237a-4]</a> premium-association affords, in this respect
sufficient security from the first, but the ratio between its security-fund
and the amount of its assumed liabilities becomes less favorable as the
business is extended, in case the fund itself is not enlarged.<a id="fnanchor_237a-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_237a-5">[237a-5]</a> Mutual insurance may accomplish something
analogous to that accomplished by a joint-stock fund by collecting a
reserve of yearly dues in advance, thus modifying the burdensome
vacillation of the amount payable each year.<a id="fnanchor_237a-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_237a-6">[237a-6]</a> Experience, however, teaches, that the
strongest form of mutual insurance, that supported either by municipalities
or by the state, has been able to meet extraordinary damage from fire much
better than premium-institutions, which are too quickly left in the lurch
by the stockholders when the damage is greater than the amount of the stock
subscribed. So also loss from fire caused by war or riots is for the most
part and on principle, excluded by speculative insurance institutions.<a id="fnanchor_237a-7"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_237a-7">[237a-7]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 258]</span>In point of cheapness to the
insured, mutual insurance seems to have the advantage, since it
contemplates no profit.<a id="fnanchor_237a-8"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_237a-8">[237a-8]</a> From a national-economical point of view, also, it
is very much of a question, whether the active competition of premium
institutions, in a sphere which affords little room for industry proper, is
more of a spur to make them "puff up" their claims (<i>Reclamen</i>) or to
the simplification of their administration.<a id="fnanchor_237a-9"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_237a-9">[237a-9]</a> However, premium-institutions are more easily
capable of extending the circle of their business;<a id="fnanchor_237a-10"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_237a-10">[237a-10]</a> which of itself decreases the general
expenses and strengthens their insuring power. Premium-insurance supposes a
greater development of capitalistic speculation than does mutual insurance.
But, even in the highest stages of civilization, the competition of some
mutual insurance companies is desirable to protect the insured from a too
high rate of profit to the insurers.<a id="fnanchor_237a-11"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_237a-11">[237a-11]</a> <a id="fnanchor_237a-12"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_237a-12">[237a-12]</a> And since the principle of <span class="pagenum">[Pg 259]</span> mutual insurance has so little attraction for
capitalists in a time like that in which we live that it can be maintained
perhaps only by the support of the state or of municipalities, we may
consider the desirableness of the state's continuing to participate in some
way in the matter of insurance as established.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_237a-1"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_237a-1" class="pginternal">[237a-1]</a> We might, however, improperly add
 another class, that of self-insurance, which lies in the proper
 distribution of a large capital over a great many points. When, for
 instance, a large state insures its buildings, this seems a superfluous
 outlay of public money for the benefit of private associations. Or does
 England insure its ships? On this account, in Prussia, the insurance of
 post-offices which Frederick William favored, has recently been done away

<a href="#fnanchor_237a-2" class="pginternal">[237a-2]</a> According to <i>Brüggemann</i> (D.
 Allg. Ztg., 1849, No., 75 ff.), 100 million thalers of an insurance-sum.
 Actual American legislation prescribes in the case of mutual insurance a
 minimum number of members of from 200 to 400, a minimum amount of annual
 premiums of from $25,000 to $200,000, of cash payments on the annual
 premium of from 10 to 40 per cent. of cash-paid yearly premiums, $5,000 to
 $40,000; and a maximum amount of premium notes made by a member of $500.
 (Compare Mittheilungen, 26 ff.)</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_237a-3"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_237a-3" class="pginternal">[237a-3]</a> Hence several mutual companies
 limit themselves to a maximum liability. Thus, for instance, the Gotha
 Fire Insurance Company requires from each member a bond that in case of
 necessity, four times the amount of the presumptive contribution paid in
 advance shall be paid after; in Altona, six times the yearly premium is
 the maximum.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_237a-4"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_237a-4" class="pginternal">[237a-4]</a> In France, every
 premium-insurance-company has to be approved by the government (Cod. de
 Comm., art 37), and the approval is not given until 1/5 of the joint-stock
 capital has been deposited. (<i>Block</i>, Dictionn. de l'administration,
 Fr. 153.) Many recent American laws require that the shares of insurance
 companies should be registered with the name of the owner.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_237a-5"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_237a-5" class="pginternal">[237a-5]</a> The Aix-Munich Fire Insurance
 Association raised its joint-stock capital<a id="fnanchor_TN58"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN58">[TN

<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_237a-6"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_237a-6" class="pginternal">[237a-6]</a> Usually so that the regular yearly
 contribution is higher than the average damage and cost of administration;
 this excess is then returned in the form of a dividend, either immediately
 at the close of the yearly account, or which is still safer, after several
 years. In the Stuttgart private insurance company, the reserve must amount
 to one per cent. of the amount insured, before the premium-surplus is
 returned. The Gotha fire insurance company, between 1821 and 1842, paid
 back an average of 46 per cent.; and even in 1842, after the Hamburg
 conflagration, there was an after-payment of only 98 per cent. necessary.
 This collection in advance of a fund for extraordinary losses is more
 secure than borrowing in case of need, and paying back in good years.
 Thus, the Baden Landes-Brandkasse had a debt in 1837 of 800,000 florins.
 (<i>Rau</i>, in the Archiv., III, 320 ff.) In a mutual insurance company,
 where entrance and exit are free, this would be scarcely possible.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_237a-7"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_237a-7" class="pginternal">[237a-7]</a> Nearly three-fourths of the public
 insurance institutions insure also against fire caused by war (Mitth.,
 1874, 85), a matter of importance even as war is waged in our own days,
 since in 1870-71, the damage from fire by the Franco-Prussian war in
 France was estimated at 141,000,000 francs. (Mitth., 1873, 33.)</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_237a-8"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_237a-8" class="pginternal">[237a-8]</a> In Prussia, the mutual fire
 insurance companies, in 1865 and 1866 had an administration outlay of 0.24
 and 0.22 per 1,000 of the amount insured; the premium insurance companies
 of 0.80 and 0.96; the latter doubtless including large assessments for
 common purposes. (Preuss. Statist. Ztschr., 1868, 269.) In all Germany,
 the outlay for administration is, for public institutions, 4 per cent. of
 the contributions; for premium institutions, inclusive of their dividends,
 37.1 per cent.; for the more important French private institutions, even
 68.8 per cent. (Mitth., 1874, 89, 92.)</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_237a-9"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_237a-9" class="pginternal">[237a-9]</a> German public fire insurance
 institutions generally have a territory of their own, in which that
 institution is the only one of the kind. On the other hand, the premium
 institutions in the whole empire keep about 80,000 agents, i. e., a number
 50 times as large as the number of officers of the former, (loc. cit.

<a href="#fnanchor_237a-10" class="pginternal">[237a-10]</a> Mutual insurance companies, as

 the insurance companies against damage by hail at Lübeck, Güstrow, Schwedt

<a href="#fnanchor_237a-11" class="pginternal">[237a-11]</a> The founder of the Mutual Fire

 <i>Einzelhöfe</i> in Germany, small mutual insurance companies are
 possible, and insurance then may be very cheap.</p>

 1861 was 116.6 thalers; in 1866, 154.2; in 1869, 176.6; in the latter in

<p>INSURANCE IN GENERAL.—ECONOMIC ADVANTAGES OF INSURANCE.</p>
<p>The national-economic advantage of insurance consists in this, that the
damage which is divided among many, and which, therefore, is felt but
lightly by each one, is probably made up for, not by an inroad upon the
body of still existing original resources, but by savings made from income.
This, indeed, is unconditionally true only of such damage as does not
depend at all on the will of man, such as, for instance, the damage caused
by hail. On the other hand, there is especially in maritime<a id="fnanchor_237b-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_237b-1">[237b-1]</a> and fire insurance,<a id="fnanchor_237b-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_237b-2">[237b-2]</a> a great temptation to culpable and even criminal
destruction; to the latter, when the object insured is estimated at too
high a value. (Speculation-fires!) And it is difficult to say whether this
drawback or that advantage is the greater. But, on the other hand, every
kind of insurance is attended by good consequences <span class="pagenum">[Pg 260]</span> to the credit of a people. It is of
advantage to personal credit, since it prevents sudden impoverishment; but
it is by far more advantageous to real-credit (<i>Realcredit</i> =
<i>material credit</i>) the pledges of which, while their forms may be
destroyed, it preserves the value of; that is their economic essence. This
last is most clearly manifest in the case of public insurance institutions,
with compulsory participation; while in the case of entirely voluntary
insurance, the creditor can <span class="pagenum">[Pg 261]</span> never be
certain that his debtor has not neglected something necessary. The
aggregate danger is less than the sum of individual dangers, for the reason
that it is more certain, and that uncertainty of itself is an element of
danger.<a id="fnanchor_237b-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_237b-3">[237b-3]</a> <a id="fnanchor_237b-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_237b-4">[237b-4]</a></p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_237b-1"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_237b-1" class="pginternal">[237b-1]</a> Even in Demosthenes' oration
 against Zenothemis, we may see how easily the analogy of maritime
 insurance may lead to criminal destruction of property. Similar cases
 mentioned by <i>Pegolotti</i> before the middle of the 14th century.
 (Delia Decima dei Fiorentini, III, 132.)</p>

<a href="#fnanchor_237b-2" class="pginternal">[237b-2]</a>
 French experience teaches that during a commercial crisis there are more
 fires in mercantile magazines than at other times; while in times when
 sugar is a drug in the market, etc., many sugar factories are burned.
 (Dictionnaire de l'Econ. polit, I, 88.) The style of our house-building
 and fire-extinguishing institutions is wont to improve with economic
 culture. Hence, for instance, in Mecklenburg, 1651 to 1799, cities burned
 down, in whole or in greatest part, 72 times; 1800 to 1850, only once.
 (<i>Boll</i>, Gesch., von Mecklenb., II, 618 ff.) However, in many
 countries the damage caused by fire has largely increased: in Baden, for
 instance, by 100,000 florins a year. Insurance capital, 1809 to 1818, 65
 fl.; 1819 to 1828, 128 fl.; 1829 to 1836, 152 fl. (<i>Rau</i>, Archiv,
 III, 322.) Similarly in Switzerland. In Bavaria, of every 10,000 buildings
 insured, in 1856-60, there were 4.6 fires per annum; 1861-65, 5.04;
 1866-69, 8.67. (Preuss. Statist. Ztschr., 1871, 315.)</p>
<p class="footnote">In Saxony, in 1849-53, there was one fire in every 290
 buildings; 1854-58, in every 201; 1859-63, in every 180. Of these fires,
 68 per cent. of the whole number were from known causes, i. e., 36.4 per
 cent. from incendiarism; 28.5 per cent. from negligence. (Sächs, Statist.
 Ztschr., 1866, 106, 115.) Even in antiquity, similar evil consequences
 attended the generosity which gratuitously compensated damage by fire.
 Compare <i>Juvenal</i>, III, 215 ff.; <i>Martial</i>, III, 52. In England,
 of every 128 cases of damage by fire of "farming stock," 49 were caused by
 incendiaries, for the most part actuated by revenge. Hence, there, a
 notice is posted on insured buildings by the insurance companies which
 runs: "this farm is insured; the fire office will be the only sufferer in
 the event of a fire." In London, of every seven fires among the small
 trading class, one is estimated to have been the work of an incendiary,
 and of all fires at least one-third (Athenæum, 2, Nov., 1867), if not
 one-half (Mitth., 1879, 100). One of the largest English fire insurance
 companies estimates that the introduction of the lucifer match has caused
 it a damage of £10,000 per annum. Of 9,345 fires, 932 were ascribed to
 gas, 89 to certain, and 76 to doubtful, incendiarism, 127 to lucifer
 matches, 8 to storms, 100 to negligence, 80 to drunkenness, 2,511 to the
 catching fire of curtains, 1,178 to candles, 1,555 to chimneys,<a id="fnanchor_TN59"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN59">[TN 59]</a> 494 to stoves, 1,323 to unknown causes. (Quart.
 Rev., Dec, 1854, 14 ff.) Fires originate from criminal (<i>dolose</i>)
 causes most frequently when a new stage in the politico-economical
 development of a people is reached, which renders the buildings put up in
 a former and lower stage of development insufficient.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_237b-3"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_237b-3" class="pginternal">[237b-3]</a> A Prussian fire insurance
 regulation, as far back as 1720, expressly says: "everybody scruples to
 make the least loan on pledged houses in towns." "Every care shall be
 taken to make the least possible amount of loans in cities."
 (<i>Jacobi</i>, in <i>Engel's</i> Zeitschr., 1862, 122.) <i>Leib</i>,
 Dritte Periode, etc., 1708, cites a proverb to the effect that, in
 Hamburg, "no house takes fire;" that is, at a time that its
 fire-fund-system (<i>Brandkassenwesen</i>) had as yet found few imitators,
 <i>v. Justi's</i> proposition to combine the insurance of houses against
 fire with a loaning-bank for houses. (Polizeiwissenschaft, 1756, I, § 7, 8
 ff.) In Russia, in 1815, the loaning bank was the only fire insurance
 company, which however assumed risks only on stone houses at three-fourths
 of their value in consideration of 15 per 1,000 annual premium.

<p class="center smaller">FIRE INSURANCE.</p>
<p>The present system of fire insurance has been introduced in many places
by the establishment of so-called domanial fire-guilds
(<i>Domanial-Brandgilden</i>), by which the country population on
crown-lands bound themselves to mutually assist one another by furnishing
thatch, and horse and hand power in the rebuilding of burned houses.
Whatever was wanting after this was made up by gratuitous supplies of wood
from the public forests, by the granting of governmental fire-licenses to
beg (<i>begging letters</i>), by permission to have collections made in the
churches<a id="fnanchor_237c-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_237c-1">[237c-1]</a> etc. The next step
was generally the establishment <span class="pagenum">[Pg 262]</span> of
public insurance (<i>Landes-Assecuranz</i>) only for houses,<a id="fnanchor_237c-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_237c-2">[237c-2]</a> but with compulsory membership. This
compulsion was justified by the continuing interest of the state in the
payment of the house-tax, as well as by the interest of the eventual owner
of the estate, and of hypothecation-creditors.<a id="fnanchor_237c-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_237c-3">[237c-3]</a> <a id="fnanchor_237c-4"></a>
<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_237c-4">[237c-4]</a> The insurance
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 263]</span> of moveable property is much more
recent, both by reason of the nature of the property itself, which becomes
of importance only at a later date, and also on account of the much greater
difficulty of carrying on such insurance.<a id="fnanchor_237c-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_237c-5">[237c-5]</a> The thought of making this species of insurance
compulsory, or of turning it over to the state, has seldom been
suggested.</p>

 of Saxony of Dec. 7, 1715; but the fire-fund (<i>Feuerkasse</i>) of 1729
 depended on voluntary but regular collections, besides which it obtained
 certain contributions from the state and the church. Those who gave
 nothing, however, were threatened with getting nothing, or very little, in
 case of fire. Parties desiring to rebuild massively had especially much to
 expect. (Cod. August Forst., I, 538.) The charters of the oldest German
 <i>Landesbrandkassen</i> contain a provision that, in future, no further
 fire-collections shall be allowed.</p>

 The English Hand-in-Hand Fire Office for houses, founded in 1696; the
 Union Fire O., for houses and movable property, in 1714: both mutual
 institutions. The premium-institution, the Sun Fire Office, 1710
 (<i>Frankenberg</i>, Europ. Herold, 1705, II, 181), mentions fire
 insurance as a special characteristic of England. But we may trace fire
 insurance on buildings and harvest supplies in the low countries about the
 Vistula in Prussia, even as far back as 1623. (<i>Jacobi</i>, loc. cit.,
 131.) Brandenburg fire-fund, 1705, with voluntary admittance of all
 houses, and fixed relation between the yearly contribution and the
 insurance capital. If a fire happened, the fund repaired the damage caused
 to the fullest extent its means allowed. (<i>Mylius</i>, Corp. Const.
 March. V., I, 174 seq.) Even in 1706, it became necessary to prohibit
 speaking ill of the institution. It was, therefore, abolished later. The
 first Würtemberg private fire insurance company, 1754, founded on similar
 principles, and which was still existing in 1760, had a like fate
 (<i>Bergius</i>, Polizei und Camerelmagazin, III, 40 ff.), but it was
 exchanged in 1773 for a mutual public company. In Berlin a mutual
 insurance company in 1718 (<i>Bergius</i>, Cameralistenbibliothek, 151);
 in Denmark, 1830 (<i>Thaarup</i>, Dän. Statist., II, 173 seq.); in
 Silesia,<a id="fnanchor_TN60"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN60">[TN 60]</a> 1742;
 Calenberg-Grubenhagen, 1750; in Baden, 1758; in Kurmark, 1765; in
 Hildesheim, 1765; in Hesse-Darmstadt, 1777. In France, the Parisian
 institution of 1745 is considered the oldest. (<i>Beckmann</i>, Beitr. z.
 Gesch. d. Erfindd., I, 218.)</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_237c-3"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_237c-3" class="pginternal">[237c-3]</a>
 In Galenberg-Grubenhagen only the <i>Bauerhöfe</i> subject to the common
 burthens were obliged to enter, in Hildesheim, all houses subject to
 taxation; in Darmstadt all house-owners who were allowed only a
 <i>dominium utile</i>. In Kurmark, the subjects of the estate might be
 compelled to enter by their lords, but could not be kept out. Of Prussian
 companies in 1846, entrance was compulsory only in those of East Prussia
 and Posen. In Würtemberg compulsion since 1773; confirmed in 1853. Also in
 Zurich, Jan. 24, 1832; in Schaffhausen Nov. 27, 1835. In Berne, only for
 state, municipal and mortgaged houses; for the latter only so far as it
 was not expressly left to the creditor. Introduced into Baden in 1807,
 after most of the parishes (<i>Gemeinden</i>) had voluntarily accepted it;
 confirmed in 1840. The provision that at least no judicial hypothecation
 should be made on an un-insured house is found in the Darmstadt law of
 1777, § 13, and in that of Mainz of 1780, art. I, § 15. <i>Rau</i>,
 Lehrbuch, II, § 25 a., finds compulsion in the case of property in common
 and in that of property belonging to other persons very appropriate. It is
 a matter worthy of thought, that, in cities like Berlin, Breslau, Thorn
 and Stettin, compulsory fire insurance is still retained. In Upper
 Silesia, the abolition of compulsory provisions has had for effect to
 cause 52 per cent. of all buildings to be insured. (Press Zeitschr, 1867,
 329).</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_237c-4"></a>

 Question of introducing state insurance into Hungary. As a cultured land,
 and one rich in capital, is better adapted to insurance, it would be folly
 to "emancipate" ones self from Trieste, etc. in this respect. But, on the
 other hand, only state-insurance can attract the Hungarians and make them
 feel universally the want of insurance. A reconciliation of these opposing
 views might be effected by compelling the peasantry to insure their farm
 houses, and allowing complete liberty in the cities and with reference to
 movable property.</p>

 Even <i>Bergins</i>, Polizei und Cameralmag., III, 80, 1768 ff., doubts
 the possibility of the insurance of movable property. Insurance of movable
 property of the Evangelical clergy in the electorate of Mark, in which,
 however, only movable property of the value of 400 thalers is considered.
 But by this provision the changeableness of the object, which so
 facilitates fraud, was done away with. Hamburg joint-stock company for the
 insurance of movable property, 1779. Electorate of Saxony fire-fund for
 movable property, 1784-1818, which, however, made good, as a rule, only 25
 per cent. of the damage caused. In Prussia, in 1814, there were only 12
 insurance companies in which movable property could be insured. In the
 aggregate even they were but of little extent, and had generally a
 partnership, guild, or communal basis. (<i>Jacobi</i>, loc. cit, 123.) On
 the other hand, in 1869, there were in all the mutual insurance companies,
 530,600,000 thalers worth of movable property insured, besides
 2,814,800,000 thalers worth of immovable property, and 366,100,000 thalers
 worth of property of a mixed nature, partly movable and partly immovable.

<p class="center smaller">REQUISITES OF A GOOD SYSTEM OF FIRE
INSURANCE.</p>
<p>Among the chief requisites of a good fire insurance system are the
following:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 264]</span>A. The adoption in insuring of
measures for the prevention of criminal abuse on the part of the insured.
No one should be benefited by the burning of his insured goods.<a id="fnanchor_237d-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_237d-1">[237d-1]</a> Hence, the rates of insurance should be
rigidly fixed according to the real value in exchange.<a id="fnanchor_237d-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_237d-2">[237d-2]</a> In the case of houses, the value of the
incombustible elements of value should be deducted; also the value of the
ground and the value it possesses from being advantageously situated, etc.
The simultaneous insurance of the same object in several companies without
proper notice being given should be unconditionally prohibited.<a id="fnanchor_237d-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_237d-3">[237d-3]</a> The control <span class="pagenum">[Pg
265]</span> of all this may be greatly facilitated by requiring foreign
insurance companies to obtain a special permit to carry on their business
in the country, and to allow them to effect insurance only through
responsible home agents.<a id="fnanchor_237d-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_237d-4">[237d-4]</a> Most insurance companies exclude from insurance
personal property which may be easily secreted, such, for instance, as
jewels, cash money, valuable documents, etc.</p>
<p>B. There should be a just proportion between the insurance premium and
the risk. This depends not only on the style of building of the houses
themselves and of those in the neighborhood,<a id="fnanchor_237d-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_237d-5">[237d-5]</a> on the situation, the too great intricacy
(<i>Complicirung</i>) <span class="pagenum">[Pg 266]</span> of which
extends the ravages of fire, as its too great isolation makes assistance
difficult;<a id="fnanchor_237d-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_237d-6">[237d-6]</a> but also on the nature of
the business carried on in them,<a id="fnanchor_237d-7"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_237d-7">[237d-7]</a> and on the condition of the local development of
fire police. Highly cultured places, especially large cities, are really
much less exposed to damage from fire. To not take this into account would
be not only to compulsorily dole out charity to the poorer classes of the
people, and to the less cultivated portions of the country,<a id="fnanchor_237d-8"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_237d-8">[237d-8]</a> but it would indirectly <span class="pagenum">[Pg 267]</span> put an obstacle in the way of a transition
to the massive construction of houses, and of good, that is, as a rule, of
costly fire-extinguishing institutions.<a id="fnanchor_237d-9"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_237d-9">[237d-9]</a> On the other hand, administration must be rendered
much more difficult by the taking of risks of many degrees of danger,

<p>C. The certainty of compensation for damage suffered. The government
should see to it that the institution does not promise more than it can
perform with its joint-stock capital and by means of its premiums.<a id="fnanchor_237d-13"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_237d-13">[237d-13]</a> The good will of foreign

protect themselves against the <span class="pagenum">[Pg 269]</span> risk
of very large insurances by the system of re-insurance, by transferring a
portion of the premium as well as of the risk to one or more other
insurance companies.<a id="fnanchor_237d-14"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_237d-14">[237d-14]</a></p>
<p>D. In all highly cultured quarters, the almost entirely voluntary
fire-extinguishing system, in which the people turned out in a body to
battle with the flames, made way for the fire-militia system; and if the
latter should make place for what we may designate as a standing fire-army
which is most easily attained in connection with the fire-insurance system,
we should reach the ideal of such a system, especially if the business of
insurance was in the hands of the state or of the municipality. Such a
system would be in accordance with the principle of the division of labor,
and, also, with the fact that usually the most vital interest is the
greatest spur to action.<a id="fnanchor_237d-15"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_237d-15">[237d-15]</a></p>

<a href="#fnanchor_237d-1" class="pginternal">[237d-1]</a> The former almost unrestricted
 liberty of the American system of insurance has recently been curtailed,
 in most of the states, by a rigid governmental superintendence, by special
 insurance boards with power to permit companies to engage in the business
 of insurance, and endowed with the right of imposing proper penalties, but
 of declaring the privilege forfeited at the end of any year. Compare
 <i>Brämer</i> in III, Ergänzungshefte der Preuss. Statist. Ztschr. und
 Mitth., 1871, No. 1.</p>

 The first fire insurance provisions or regulations paid little attention
 to the danger of over-valuation. Similarly <i>v. Justi</i>, Abh. von der
 Macht, Glückseligkeit, etc., eines Staats. 1860, 81. Also <i>Krünitz</i>,
 Oekonom. Encyclopædie, 1788, XIII, considers it improbable that any one
 would have his home insured at a higher than its real value. On the other
 hand, there were formerly bitter complaints made in the United States that
 the agents, on whom the determination of the rate of premium and the
 control of the insurance-sum depended chiefly, were led to make
 over-valuations in furtherance of their own interests. (Mitth., 1871, 3;
 1874, 95.)</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_237d-3"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_237d-3" class="pginternal">[237d-3]</a>
 If the valuation were made to depend on the purchase price or on the cost
 of replacing or restoring the damaged property, even this would be some
 temptation to not entirely upright men. Hence the Baden law of 1840
 expressly provides that instead of this, the selling price shall be the
 basis; the law of 1852, § 17, the medium cost of the combustible parts,
 after deduction made of the diminution in value caused by age. The fixing
 of premiums in the case of houses should be repeated from time to time on
 account of wear. According to the Calenb. Grubenh. law of 1823, § 21,
 every 10 years. According to the Baden law of 1852, § 28, 33, and the
 Württemberg law of 1853, § 12, the city council should examine annually in
 what cases a new valuation was necessary. The more certainly
 over-insurance is avoided, the less need is there of the superintendence
 policy adapted to a rather barbarous state of insurance, that only a part
 of the value shall be made good. The Phœnix fire insurance company in
 Baden for the insurance of movable property has reserved the right to
 investigate at any time and to satisfy itself as to the value of the
 insured object, and to lower the amount insured in accordance with its own
 opinion. The provision that the valuation shall be made by the authorities
 of the place, or that it shall be approved by them is frequently found. In
 Saxony, for instance (law of Nov. 14, 1835), the Leipzig city council
 gives its approval when it finds the amount insured in keeping with the
 means of the insured, and entertains no suspicions as to his honesty. To
 what a bad state of things a less liberal course leads, see in
 <i>Masius</i>, loc. cit., 85. This indeed is only difficult in large
 cities. It is also to be considered that it is not so much the many small
 amounts, but the few large ones that are dangerous to insurance. The
 Prussian scheme wanted to give up the police superintendence of insurance,
 but to punish over-insurance of more than 5 per cent. of the common value,
 by imposing a fine equal to the amount of over-insurance on the insured,
 the agents, and on the conductors of the business. (<i>Jacobi</i>, in II.
 Ergänzhefte der Preuss. Statist. Ztschr., 1869.) The provision that the
 amount paid as damages for a burned house shall be immediately employed in
 rebuilding, is to be explained in part by requisite A; in part also by the
 same police-guardianship against presumed negligence which introduced
 compulsory insurance.</p>

<i>Oberländer</i>, loc. cit. 108, calls insurance without classification
 of risks, a "mutual benevolent institution;" and one rigidly classified
 according to the probable period of burning, "an institution for the
 making of advances" (<i>Vorschuss-Anstalt.</i>) In Baden, even in 1737,
 there was no difference made between a massive building and a wooden hut
 with a straw roof in the Black forest. (<i>Rau</i>, Archiv., III, 324.)
 Here, there was in 1844 to 1849, an average damage by fire in houses with
 brick roofs of 1,302 florins, with thatch roofs of 1,786 florins, with
 shingle roofs of 2,292 florins, to say nothing of the greater frequency of
 such damage in each succeeding class. (<i>Rau</i>, Lehrbuch, II, 1, § 26,
 a.) In Württemberg, before 1843, the owners of insured personal property,
 in houses with thatch roofs, had, in the same time, received 22 per 1,000
 compensation for damage; in houses with brick roofs, from 8 to 9 per
 1,000. (<i>Rau</i>, loc. cit.) In 17 German insurance companies, between
 1866 and 1869, massive buildings with hard roofs paid 1,003,000 thalers
 and received 612,000 thalers; the not massive with hard roofs paid
 1,544,000 thalers and received 1,339,000; houses with soft roofs paid
 2,420,000 and received 2,792,000. (Preuss, Statist. Zeitschr. 1861, 327.)

<p class="footnote">(Quart. Rev., 1854, 23.) There is indeed a difference
 in the intensity of these fires. For instance, in inns, there have been a
 great many; but the damage has been for the most part insignificant.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_237d-8"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_237d-8" class="pginternal">[237d-8]</a>
 In Paris the houses insured had a value of 2,370,000,000 francs, but the
 damage from fire amounted to only 0.016 per 1,000! (Dictionn. d'Econ.
 politique, I, 89.) On an average, the premiums in France amount to 0.85
 per 1,000. In Prussia, 1867-69 on an average: in the province of Prussia,
 9.46 per 1,000; Posen, 3.75; Brandenburg, Berlin not included, 2.82;
 Pomerania, 2.52; Westphalia, 2.15; Schleswig-Holstein, 2.09; Hanover,
 1.99; Silesia, 1.68; Saxony, 1.47; Hesse-Nassau, 1.46; the Rhine country,
 1.34; Sigmaringen, 0.56; city of Berlin, 0.28 per 1,000. (Preuss. Statist.
 Zeitschr., 1871, 289.) How largely a higher civilization tends to arrest
 the spread of fire by the reason of the great facilities of rendering
 assistance is shown by the fact that for 100 buildings totally consumed in
 Posen, in 1837-40, there were 13.4 only injured: in 1866-69, 32 were
 injured for 100 totally consumed. In Prussian Saxony, 1839-44, 34;
 1867-69, 57. (loc. cit., 329.) In Baden, the district called the
 <i>Seekreis</i> got from the fire-fund, in 1845-49, 80 per cent. more than
 it contributed to it; the middle Rhine district contributed 37 per cent.
 more than it received. The Bavarian Reza district, 1828-29, received only
 11.4 per cent. for damages, and paid 19 per cent. of all premiums; the
 Lower Danube district, 10 and 8.8 per cent. (<i>Rau</i>, Lehrbuch, II, §
 28, 26.) The city of Leipzig contributed from 1/19 to 1/17 of the
 insurance paid, 1864-68, to the insurance companies taking risks on real
 property in the kingdom of Saxony, and received back only from 1/662 to
 1/114, although its fire extinguishing institutions cost, in 1870, 26,182
 thalers. (Official.)</p>

 Even premium-institutions have frequently very different rates for the
 same risk, according as they fear greater or less competition, or desire
 to recommend themselves in a new place, etc. Hence the tricks of the trade
 with which most of them surround their tariff.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_237d-10"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_237d-10" class="pginternal">[237d-10]</a>
 In Würtemberg, theaters, powder mills, places where brick and lime are
 burned, porcelain factories, iron-works, etc. cannot be insured at all. In
 Calenb-Grubenh. and Bremen-Verden, shingle-roofed houses can be insured
 only at 2/3 of their real value.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_237d-11"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_237d-11" class="pginternal">[237d-11]</a>
 Thus, for instance, in the electorate of Mark, each of the four classes of
 houses bears its own loss alone. To the fourth class, for instance, belong
 smithies, brick factories, and buildings with steam engines, etc. The
 Baden law of 1852 puts the same burthen in the same place, upon houses
 exposed to danger in a greater or lesser degree; but provides for 4
 classes (<i>Gemeindeclassen</i>) with different rates of contribution, and
 assigns each <i>Gemeinde</i> every year, according to the relative
 magnitude of the losses of the previous year, to one of those classes. How
 risky it is for large cities to confine their insurance, because of the
 ordinarily small amount of damage to them from fire, only to insurance
 institutions of their own, is shown by the case of Hamburg in the year
 1842, where three joint stock insurance companies could pay only from 75
 to 80 per cent., and the Bieber Mutual Insurance Company, only 20 per
 cent.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_237d-12"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_237d-12" class="pginternal">[237d-12]</a>
 In the case of buildings, the greater risk is generally calculated by
 correspondingly multiplying the insurance-value, but in case of damage by
 fire, it is simply made good.</p>

 In the insurance companies specified by <i>Masius</i>, loc. cit., 176, the
 aggregate amount of their insurance, stood to the amount necessary to
 cover it, by means of receipts from premiums, reserve, and joint-stock
 capital:</p>

<p class="footnote">In the same companies the amount of damage and of
 expense for the last preceding year were, on every 100 thalers, of
 insurance, 46 pfennigs (1/300 thalers), 44, 29, 48, 67, 55, 35, 42; an
 average of 45, that is 1½ per 1,000. Besides, much depends on the degree
 to which the joint-stock capital can be applied. Thus, for instance, in
 Berlin, on every 1,000 thalers 200 are paid in cash, and a note
 (<i>Solawechsel</i>) given for the rest, payable in two months after
 notice. Where the unpaid remaining stock is but a mere book-debt, and may
 even be evaded by disclaiming the stock itself, it of course affords very
 little security.</p>

 The preparatory steps towards this ideal were taken long ago. Thus, for
 instance, the personal-property insurance companies have offered premiums
 for special merit in extinguishing fires (Calenb.-Grubenh., 1814, § 35),
 saving things from a burning house is looked after by the agents of
 personal property insurance companies; compensation is almost universally
 made not only for the damage done by fire, but also that caused while the
 fire is being extinguished. The excellent fire-extinguishing institutions
 of England are maintained by the common action of the insurance companies.
 There have been complaints, however, that they have shown a preference for
 insured objects. (Mitth., 1874, 113.)]</p>

<p>That amid the thousand dangers which threaten the existence of the
individual the species may endure, the Creator has endowed every class of
organic beings with such reproductive power, and so much pleasure in
propagating their kind, that if the action of these were entirely
unrestricted, it would soon fill up the earth.<a id="fnanchor_238-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_238-1">[238-1]</a> In the case of the human race, also, the
physiological possibility of propagation has very wide limits.<a id="fnanchor_238-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_238-2">[238-2]</a> It <span class="pagenum">[Pg 274]</span> would be
nothing extraordinary that a healthy pair, living in wedlock from the 20th
to the 42nd year of the woman's life, that is, during the whole time of her
full capacity to bear children, should rear six children to the age of
puberty. This would, therefore, suffice to treble the population in a
single generation; provided that all who had grown up should marry.
According to Euler,<a id="fnanchor_238-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_238-3">[238-3]</a> when the births were 5
per cent. and the deaths 2 per cent., the population doubled in not quite
24 years; when the increase was 2½ per annum, in 28 years; when 2, in 35
years, and when 1½ per cent. in 47 years.</p>
<p>The United States furnish us with a striking illustration of <span class="pagenum">[Pg 275]</span> this doctrine, and on the grandest scale.
There the natural increase of the white population, from 1790 to 1840, was
400.4 per cent.; that is in the first decade 33.9 per cent. of the
population in 1790; in the second 33.1, in the third 32.1, in the fourth
30.9, in the fifth 29.6 per cent.<a id="fnanchor_238-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_238-4">[238-4]</a> <a id="fnanchor_238-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_238-5">[238-5]</a></p>

 Thus, for instance, the sturgeon can, according to <i>Leuckart</i>,
 produce 3,000,000 eggs in a year. According to <i>Burdach</i>, the
 posterity of a pair of rabbits may be over 1,000,000 in four years; and
 that of a plant-louse, according to <i>Bonnet</i>, over a 1,000,000,000 in
 a few weeks. The prolificacy of a species of animals is wont to be greater
 in proportion as the structure-material (<i>Bildungsmaterial</i>) saved
 within a given time during the course of individual life, is greater, and
 as material wants during the embryonic period are limited; also
 (teleologically), in proportion as to the danger the individual is exposed
 to. Compare <i>Leuckart</i> in <i>R. Wagner's</i> physiolog. Wörterbuch,<a id="fnanchor_TN62"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN62">[TN 62]</a> Art. Zeugung.

 The researches of modern physiology make it probable that an ovum is
 detached from the ovaries at each period of healthy menstruation.
 (<i>Bischoff</i>, Beweis der von der Begattung unabhängigen periodischen
 Reifung und Lösung der Eier bei den Säugethieren und Menschen, 1844.) It
 is hardly possible to ascertain how many of these ova are capable of
 fecundation. Among the animals, on which the greater number of accurate
 observations have been made, that is in the case of horses, it has been
 found that, in the two districts of Prussia most favorably conditioned, of
 100 mares that had been lined, 63.3 became pregnant, and 53.5 gave birth
 to live foals; in the rest of the Prussian monarchy, the births were only
 46 per cent. Compare <i>Schubert</i>, Staatskunde, VII, 1, 98. In the
 Belgian <i>haras</i> (places for breeding horses), between 1841 and 1850,
 about 30 per cent. of the "leaps" proved fruitful, from 2 to 3 per cent.
 aborted, the rest were either probably or certainly unfruitful.
 (<i>Horn.</i>, Statist. Gemälde, 171.) In the human species, also, the
 great number of first-born generated in the first weeks of marriage, bears
 witness to a high degree of procreative susceptibility.</p>
<p class="footnote">On the other hand, the healthy male semen ejected
 during a single act of coition contains innumerable germs, a very few of
 which are sufficient to produce fecundation. (<i>Leuckart</i>, loc. cit,
 907.) According to <i>Oesterlen</i>, Handbuch der medicischen Statistik,
 1865, 196, from 10 to 20 per cent. of all marriages were childless. In the
 United Kingdom, <i>Farr</i>, report on the Census of 1851, estimated that
 in a population of 27,511,000, there were 1,000,000 childless families,
 when the term is allowed to embrace widows and widowers as well as married
 couples.</p>

 is already made of immigrants and their posterity, who after subtracting
 the loss by emigration back to the old country, amounted to over
 1,000,000. It probably amounted to more yet. If, as <i>Wappäus</i> does
 (Bevölekerungsstatistik, 1859, I, 93, 122 ff.), we calculate the rate of
 increase per annum, we have an average during the first decade of 2.89,
 during the second of 2.83, the third of 2.74, the fourth of 2.52, the
 seventh of 2.39, the eighth (1860-70) of probably 2.25 per cent. On the
 still greater ratio of increase in earlier times, see <i>Price</i>,

 that in the region about Contendas, in Brazil, there were on from 70 to 80
 births a mortality of from 3 to 4 per annum (how long?), and an
 unfortunate birth (<i>unglücklichen</i>) was scarcely ever heard of.
 Mothers 20 years of age had from 8 to 10 children; and one woman in the
 fifties had a posterity of 204 living persons. (<i>Spix und Martius</i>,

<p class="center smaller">LIMITS TO THE INCREASE OF POPULATION.</p>
<p>There is certainly one limit which the increase of no organic being can
exceed: the limit of the necessary means of subsistence. But, so far as the
human race is concerned, this notion is somewhat more extensive, inasmuch
as it embraces besides food, also clothing, shelter, fuel, and a great many
other goods which are not, indeed, necessary to life, but which are so
considered.<a id="fnanchor_239-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_239-1">[239-1]</a> We may illustrate the matter
by a simple example <span class="pagenum">[Pg 276]</span> in the rule of
division. If we take the aggregate of the means of subsistence as a
dividend, the number of mankind as divisor; then the average share of each
is the quotient. Where two of these quantities are given, the third may be
found. Only when the dividend has largely increased can the divisor and
quotient increase at the same time (prosperous increase of population). If,
however, the quotient remains unchanged, the increase of the divisor can
take place only at the expense of the quotient (proletarian increase of
population).<a id="fnanchor_239-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_239-2">[239-2]</a> Hence it is to be expected
that the quantity of the means of subsistence being given and also the
requirement of each individual, the number of births and the number of
deaths should condition each other. Where, for instance, the number of
church livings has not been increased, only as many candidates can marry as
clergymen who held such livings have died. The greater the average age of
the latter is, the later do the former marry, in the average, and <i>vice
versa</i>. And so, in the case of whole nations, when their economic
consumption and production remain unaltered.<a id="fnanchor_239-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_239-3">[239-3]</a> A basin entirely filled with <span class="pagenum">[Pg 277]</span> water can be made to contain more only in case it
is either increased itself, or a means is found to compress its contents.
Otherwise as much must flow out on the one side as is poured in on the
other.</p>
<p>And so, everything else remaining stationary, the fruitfulness of
marriages must, at least in the long run, be in the inverse ratio of their
frequency. (See § 247.)<a id="fnanchor_239-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_239-4">[239-4]</a> <a id="fnanchor_239-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_239-5">[239-5]</a></p>

 When it is known that, in the Hebrides, one-third of all the labor of the
 people has to be employed in procuring combustible material
 (<i>McCulloch</i>, Statist. Account, I, 319), it will no longer excite
 surprise that, according to Scotch statistics, some parishes increase in
 population after coal has been found in them, and others decrease when
 their turf-beds are exhausted.</p>

 Thus <i>Süssmilch</i>, Göttliche Ordnung in den Veränderungen des
 menschlichen Geschlechts, 1st ed., 1742, 4th ed., 1775, I, 126 ff.,
 assumes that one marriage a year takes place, on from every 107 to every
 113 persons living. On the other hand, 22 Dutch towns gave an average of 1
 in every 64. This abnormal proportion is very correctly ascribed by
 <i>Malthus</i>, Principles of Population, II, ch. 4, to the great
 mortality of those towns: viz., a death for every 22 or 23 persons living,
 while the average is 1:36. The Swiss, <i>Müret</i>, (in the Mémoires de la
 Société économique de Berne, 1766, I, 15 ff.), could not help wondering
 that the villages with the largest average duration of life should be
 those in which there were fewest births. "So much life-power and yet so
 few procreative resources!" Here too, <i>Malthus</i>, II, ch. 5, solved
 the enigma. The question was concerned with Alpine villages with an almost
 stationary cow-herd business: no one married until one cow-herd cottage
 had become free; and precisely because the tenants lived so long, the new
 comers obtained their places so late.

<p class="footnote">The decreased number of births in consequence of a bad
 harvest, and <i>vice versa</i>, appears of course only during the
 following calendar year. Thus, in 1847, as compared with the average of
 the years 1844 and 1845, there were fewer children born in England by 4
 per 1,000, in Saxony by 7 per 1,000, in Lombardy by 59, in France by 63,
 in Prussia by 82, in Belgium by 122, in Holland by 159 per 1,000.
 (<i>Horn</i>, I, 239 ff.) In Germany, the conscription-years corresponding
 to the scarcity time, 1816-17, gave a <i>minus</i> of 25 per cent. in many
 places below the average. (<i>Bernouilli</i>, Populationistik, 219.) In
 the case of marriage, the relative increase or decrease is still more
 characteristic, so far as our purpose is concerned, than the absolute
 increase or decrease. Thus in Belgium, for instance, against 1,000
 marriages dissolved by death, there were, in 1846, only 971 new ones
 contracted, and in 1847 only 747; while in 1850 there were 1,500. The
 falling off in Flanders alone was still greater. Thus, in 1847, there were
 only 447 marriages contracted for 1,000 dissolved. (<i>Horn</i>, I, 170
 ff.) However, <i>Berg</i>, using Sweden as an illustration, rightly calls
 attention to the fact, that the variations in the number of marriages and
 births is determined in part by the number of adults, that is, of the
 number of births 20 and more years before. Compare <i>Engel's</i> Statist.

 Sometimes, a sudden increase in the frequency of marriages may have very
 accidental and transitory causes. Thus, for instance, in France in 1813,
 when the unmarried were so largely conscripted, the number of marriages
 rose to 387,000, whereas the average of the five previous years was
 229,000. (<i>Bernouilli</i>, Populationistik, 103.)</p>

 number of conceptions. (<i>Horn</i>., I, 241 seq.) According to

 relatively large number of births in proportion as in any locality,
 commerce and industry preponderate over agriculture, and <i>vice
 versa</i>. See <i>Engel</i>, Bewegung der Bevölkerung im K. Sachsen, 1854.
 But this should not be generalized into a universal law. For instance,
 Prussia and Posen have an average number of births greater than that of
 the Rhine country and Westphalia. (<i>v. Viebahn</i>, Statistik des L. V,

directions as much as it was diminished by it in others. France's own
territory was devastated only in the first and in the last years of the
war. But the Revolution had, on the whole, once the storms of the Reign of
Terror were over, not only more equally divided the means of subsistence in
France, but it had developed them in a higher degree.<a id="fnanchor_241-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_241-3">[241-3]</a> <a id="fnanchor_241-4"></a>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 283]</span>It cannot even be unconditionally
predicated of emigration, that it hinders the increase of population. As
soon as people have begun to calculate upon emigration, as a resort for
themselves in case of distress, or upon the emigration of others, by which
they would be left a larger field for action at home, a number of marriages
is contracted and a number of children born; which would otherwise not have
been the case. Most men, especially when young and enamoured, hope for the
realization of all their wishes. Favorable chances, open to a great number
of men alike and which every one thinks himself competent to calculate, are
commonly over-estimated by the majority.<a id="fnanchor_241-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_241-5">[241-5]</a> (See § 259.)</p>

 The war of 1870-71 cost Germany 44,890 lives. (Preuss. Statist. Ztschr.,
 1872, 293.) This number is not quite 20 per cent. of the excess of births
 (794,206) over deaths (563,065) in Prussia in the year 1865. On the other
 hand, in from 1856 to 1861 there were 10,000 cases of murder and
 manslaughter in all Europe, Turkey excepted. (<i>Hausner</i>, Vergl.
 Statistik, I, 145.) About the end of the last century, it was estimated
 that about 1,000,000 children were born annually in France.
 (<i>Necker</i>, Administration des Finances, I, 256.) Of these, about
 600,000 outlived their 18th year. (<i>Peuschet</i>, Essai de Statistique,
 31.) There were, annually, about 220,000 marriages. Hence the number of
 the unmarried was increased annually by 80,000 young men, who, according
 to <i>Peucshet</i> (32), amounted to over 1,450,000. According to this,
 the number of recruits, per annum, might amount to hundreds of thousands
 without causing any appreciable diminution in the number of births and
 marriages. Compare <i>Malthus</i>, Principle of Population, II, ch. 6. On
 the other hand, long continued wars have the effect of keeping the men
 physically strongest from marriage, and so to deteriorate the race.</p>

 Richesse de Hollande, I, 149. During the Amsterdam commercial crisis, from
 1795 to 1814, there were for every 4 births an average of 7 deaths. So
 that the population, in 1795, was still 217,000, and in 1815, only
 180,000. (<i>Bickes</i>, Bewegung der Bevölkerung Anhang, 28.)</p>

 On the other hand, the population of East Prussia, between 1807 and 1815
 diminished 14 per cent. (<i>v. Haxthausen</i>, Ländl. Verfassung der
 Preuss. Monarchie, I, 93.) The battles of the Seven Years' War are said to
 have consumed 120,000 Russians, 140,000 Austrians, 200,000 Frenchmen,
 160,000 Englishmen, Hanoverians, etc., 25,000 Swedes, 28,000 of the troops
 of the empire, and 180,000 Prussians. Yet the population of Prussia fell
 off 1,500,000. (<i>Frédéric</i>, Œuvres posthumes, IV, 414; Preuss. Gesch.
 Friedrich's M., II, 349.) During the Thirty Years' War, the population of
 Bohemia fell from 3,000,000 to 780,000. (<i>Mailath</i>, Gesch. von
 Oesterr, III, 455.) Württemberg, according to the military recruiting
 lists had a population, in 1622, of 300,000 inhabitants. (<i>Spittler</i>,
 Werke, XII, 34.) In 1641, the population was only 48,000; according to a
 promotion-speech of <i>J. B. Andreä</i>. But between 1628 and 1650, more
 than 58,000,000 florins were lost by war contributions, and about
 60,000,000 florins by plunder; about 36,000 private houses were in ruins.

 ff., 114. On Germany generally, see <i>R. F. Hanser</i>, Deutschland nach
 dem dreissigjährigen Kriege, 1862. However, many estimates of the
 diminution of the population are exaggerated, because it has not been
 considered that a great part of the men who disappeared in one place fled
 to another, for the time being more secure. Compare <i>Kius</i> in
 <i>Hildebrand's</i> Jahrb., 1870, I ff.</p>
<p class="footnote">The population of Massachusetts increased 8,310
 yearly, before the War of Independence; during the war, only 1,161,
 although the enemy scarcely ever entered the country. (<i>Ebeling</i>,

 during the war years, 1853-55, of 2,272,000, 2,148,000, and 2,541,000; in

<p class="center smaller">COUNTER TENDENCIES TO THE INCREASE OF
POPULATION.</p>
<p>The extension of economic production is always a labor; the surrender of
one's ordinary means of subsistence to new comers, a sacrifice; but, on the
other hand, the procreation of children is a pleasure. Hence it seems to be
incontestably<a id="fnanchor_TN69"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN69">[TN 69]</a> true that the powers of
increase of population, considered from an entirely sensuous point of view,
tend to go beyond the bounds of the field of food. Malthus gave expression
to this fact by saying that population had a tendency to increase in a
geometrical progression, but the means of subsistence, even under the most
favorable conditions, only in an arithmetical progression.<a id="fnanchor_242-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_242-1">[242-1]</a> If the word "tendency" be correctly understood in
the <span class="pagenum">[Pg 284]</span> sense in which Malthus employed
it, so that the reality appears as the product of several and partly
opposite tendencies,<a id="fnanchor_242-2"></a> <a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_242-2">[242-2]</a> the first half of his
allegation can scarcely be contested.<a id="fnanchor_242-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_242-3">[242-3]</a> If a father has three sons, and each of the three
three in turn, the love of procreation and the power of procreation, all
being in the normal condition of health, are precisely three times as great
in the second generation as in the first, and nine times as great in the
third, etc. The second half of Malthus's principle is more open to doubt.
If it be true, as has been asserted, that man's means of subsistence
consist solely of animals and plants, and these, as well as man, increase
in a geometrical ratio, and usually even with a much larger multiplier, yet
it is here, surprisingly enough, overlooked that their natural increase is
interrupted by the consumption of them by man. On the other hand, it is
true that even raw material, by means of more skillful technic processes (§
134, 157), and the values by which man ennobles them, may always increase
in a greater ratio than a merely arithmetical one. (§ 33).<a id="fnanchor_242-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_242-4">[242-4]</a> But, that, in the long run, the means of subsistence
should keep pace with the extreme of sensuous desire and of physiological
power, is utterly incredible. Hence, the latter tendency is limited by
others.</p>
<p>A. And indeed, firstly, by repressive counter-tendencies. As soon as
there is a larger population in existence than can be supported, the
surplus population must yield to a mournful necessity; in a favorable case,
to that of emigration, but usually to hunger, disease and misery
generally.</p>
<p>"The earth," says Sismondi, "again swallows the children she cannot
support." It is the weakest especially who are <span class="pagenum">[Pg
285]</span> elbowed off the bridge of life, over which we pass from birth
to the normal death from old age, because there is not room enough on it
for all. Hence the frightful mortality among the poorer classes and in
childhood. Now it is the absence of a healthy habitation,<a id="fnanchor_242-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_242-5">[242-5]</a> or of proper clothing, or, in the case of
children, of rational superintendence<a id="fnanchor_242-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_242-6">[242-6]</a> which sows the germs of a thousand diseases; and now
the absence of proper care, rest etc., which intensifies these diseases.
Every bad harvest is wont, when its consequences are not alleviated by a
high and <span class="pagenum">[Pg 286]</span> healthy civilization, to
increase mortality. (§ 246, 9). Thus, in Sweden, during the second half of
the 18th century, the average yearly mortality was = 1:39-40. On the other
hand, in the bad year 1771 = 1:35.7; 1772 = 1:26.7, and in 1773, as an
after consequence, 1:19.3. In this last, although it was a fertile year,
there were only 48 births to every 100 deaths.<a id="fnanchor_242-7"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_242-7">[242-7]</a> Among nations low down in civilization, the
repressive counter tendency may assume a very violent character. How many
cases of murder, human sacrifice, and even war, have been occasioned by
over-population and famine.</p>
<p>B. Secondly, by preventive counter tendencies.<a id="fnanchor_242-8"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_242-8">[242-8]</a> The person who believes himself unable to support
children refrains from begetting them. This, we may call one of the most
natural of duties. We might even say that the person who begets a child
which he knows he is not in a condition to support, is guilty of a
grievous<a id="fnanchor_TN70"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN70">[TN 70]</a> sin against civil society,
and of a still more grevious one against his poor child. Strange! To beget
a child with countless wants, with an immortal soul! That is certainly an
act the most pregnant with consequences which any ordinary man can perform
in his life; and yet how thoughtlessly it is performed by the majority!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 287]</span>This counter-tendency is to be
found only in the case of man. Plants and animals yield to the sexual
instinct regardless of everything.<a id="fnanchor_242-9"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_242-9">[242-9]</a> Where there is no question whatever of having food
enough to support children, as is the case with the better-to-do classes,
the dread of losing the decencies of life, or of "losing caste," acts as a
preventive<a id="fnanchor_242-10"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_242-10">[242-10]</a> <a id="fnanchor_242-11"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_242-11">[242-11]</a> to the founding <span class="pagenum">[Pg
288]</span> a family, or increasing the numbers of one. Unfortunately,
abstinence from the procreation of children may be exercised not only in
accordance with the moral law,<a id="fnanchor_242-12"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_242-12">[242-12]</a> but also, in contravention of it.<a id="fnanchor_242-13"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_242-13">[242-13]</a> There is a necessary connection between
human reason and human freedom and the possibility of misusing them. And it
is certainly the inevitable fate of man either to place a morally rational
check on the sexual impulse, or to be forcibly held within the limits of
the means of subsistence, since they cannot be over-stepped by
him—through the agency of vice and misery.<a id="fnanchor_242-14"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_242-14">[242-14]</a> <a id="fnanchor_242-15"></a>

 In Prussia, the Jewish population, between 1822 and 1840, increased 34½
 per cent.; the Christians only 28½ per cent.; although among the Jews
 there was only one marriage a year in every 139, and one birth in every
 28; among the Christians, in every 112 and 25. This is accounted for,
 mainly by the favorable circumstances that Jewish mothers leave their
 homes seldomer to work outside, and thereby devote more attention, even in
 the lower classes, to the care of their children.</p>

 time, the mortality sometimes decreases on account of the largely
 diminished number of small children. In Lancashire, the number of deaths

 The rule that population tends to extend everywhere as far as the means of
 subsistence will permit, <i>Sismondi</i>, N. Principes, VII, ch. 3, has
 taken occasion to ridicule, basing himself on the example of the
 Montmorency family. This family has, notoriously, always lived in
 superabundance, and is, notwithstanding, on the verge of extinction.
 <i>Sismondi</i> here forgets the relativity of the idea "means of
 subsistence." Persons occupying an exalted social position not only think
 that they want more in this respect, but they are wont in forming marriage
 contracts to use the greatest and frequently exaggerated caution. Hence it
 is that families of this rank become, relatively speaking, frequently
 extinct; and, moreover, such a fact is here most frequently taken notice
 of. <i>Sadler</i>, Law of Population, 1830, infers from the frequent
 extinction of English noble families, that wealth leads to sterility; and,
 on the other hand, poverty (but not famine!) to prolificacy; and
 <i>Doubleday's</i> (True Law of Population, 12 ff.) suggestion, in
 explanation hereof, that over-fed animals and over-manured plants are
 sterile, as ably refuted in the Edinburg Rev., LI. It is there shown that
 the marriages of the English peers are fruitful above the average; that
 their extinction is partly due to the fact that the younger sons seldom
 married, and that hence there is a lack of collateral relations. But, in
 great part, such extinction is only apparent; since such a family is said
 to be extinct when only the male stem is extinct. The French nobility,
 from the 9th to the 11th century, continually increased in number. After
 this, the succession of females and cases of extinction became more
 frequent, because the nobility, in order to keep their estates together,
 began to not desire many sons. <i>Sismondi</i>, Hist. des Français, V,

<i>Malthus</i>, P. of P., II, ch. 13. I formerly called this natural law
 by the name of the investigator who earned the largest share of scientific
 merit in connection therewith. It cannot, indeed, be said, that he was the
 first to observe it. Compare even <i>Machiavelli</i>, Discorsi (between
 1515 and 1518), II, 5. And so <i>Giovanni Botero</i> taught that the
 number of the population depended not so much on the number of
 <i>congiungimenti</i> so much as on the rearing of children. (Ragion di
 Stato, 1592, VII, 93 ff.) The <i>virtù generativa degli uomini</i>, which
 is always the same, is found face to face with the <i>virtù nutritiva
 delle citta</i>. The former would continue to operate <i>ad infinitum</i>,
 if the latter did not limit it. The larger a city is, the more difficult
 it is to provide it with the means of subsistence. In the last instance,
 the slave-sales of Guinea, the cannibalism of the Indians, the
 robber-system of the Arabians and the Tartars, the migration of nations,
 crimes, litigation, etc., are traced back to the narrowness of the means
 of subsistence. (Delle Cause della Grandezza delle Città, 1598, Libr.
 III.) Sir Walter Raleigh (ob. 1618), was of opinion that the earth would
 not only be full but overflowing with human beings were it not that
 hunger, pestilence, crime, war, abstinence welcome sterility, etc. did
 away with the surplus population. (History of the World, I, ch. 8, 4.
 Discourse of war: Works, VII, 257 ff.) According to <i>Child</i>,
 Discourse of Trade, 371 ff., 149, the population is always in proportion
 to the amount of employment.</p>
<p class="footnote">If England could employ only 100 men while 150 were
 reared, 50 would have to emigrate or perish; and so, too, conversely,
 occasional vacancies would soon be filled. Similarly <i>Davenaut</i>,
 Works II, 233, 185; who, however, in the practical application of this law
 of nature, adopts the error of his contemporary, G. King, the
 statistician, according to whom the population of England would increase
 to 11,000,000 (II, 176) only after 600 years. <i>Benjamin Franklin's</i>
 Observations Concerning the Increase of Mankind, Peopling of new
 Countries, etc., 1751, are very good. Franklin here shows that the same
 tables of mortality do not apply to town and country, nor to old nations
 and new ones. The nation increases more rapidly in proportion as it is
 easy to contract marriage. Hence the increase is smallest in luxurious
 cities and thickly populated countries. Other circumstances, being equal,
 hunting nations require the largest quantity of land for the purpose of
 subsistence, and industrial nations least. In Europe, there was a marriage
 in every 100 of the population per annum; in America, on every 50; 4
 children to a marriage in the former, and 8 in the latter.</p>
<p class="footnote">Population diminishes as a consequence of subjugation,
 bad government, the introduction of slavery, loss of territory, loss of
 trade and food. He who promotes the opposite advantages may well be called
 the "father of his country." Further, <i>D. Hume</i>, Of the Populousness
 of the Ancient Nations: Discourses No. 10. <i>Per contra, Wallace</i>, On
 the Numbers of Mankind in Ancient and Modern Times, in which the superior
 populousness of antiquity is maintained, 1753. <i>Wallace</i> relied
 chiefly on the more equable distribution of land, and the smaller luxury
 of the ancient nations. <i>Herbert</i>, Essai sur le Police des Grains
 (1755), 319 ff. Les Intérêts de la France mal entendus, par un Citoyen
 (Amsterd., 1757), I, 197.</p>
<p class="footnote"><i>Steuart</i> threw light especially on the
 connection between mortality and the number of marriages (Principles, I,
 13); and he claims, with the utmost confidence, that only the want of the
 means of subsistence, using the expression in its broadest sense (I, 15),
 can put a limit to the increase of population (I, 14). He calls wrongful
 procreation (<i>falsche Zeugung</i>) the chief cause of pauperism (II, 1),
 and his views on public charity have a strong Malthusian complexion (I,
 14). Compare further <i>A. Young</i>, Political Arithmetics (1774), I, ch.
 7. <i>Townsend</i>, Dissertation on the Poor Laws (1786), makes a happy
 use of the example of the Island of Juan Fernandez, in which a colony of
 goats was developed, first alone, and afterwards in a struggle with a
 colony of dogs, to illustrate the laws of the development of population as
 limited by the supply of food. Compare the same author's Journey through
 Spain, II, 8 seq.; 358 ff., III, 107. <i>G. M. Ortes</i>, Riflessioni
 sulla Popolazione,<a id="fnanchor_TN74"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN74">[TN 74]</a> delle Nazione per
 rapporto all'Economia nazionale, 1790, ascribes geometrical progression to
 the increase of population (cap. I) precisely as in the case of other
 animals; only, in the case of the latter, a limit is put to their increase
 by <i>forza</i>, and in the case of man, by <i>ragione</i>. When the
 population of a country has attained its proper development, celibacy is
 as necessary in order to keep it so as marriage. Otherwise the door would
 be opened to extreme pauperism, to the debauchery of the "venus vaga," to
 eunuchism and polygamy (4). Strangely enough, <i>Ortes</i> asserts that no
 people are richer per capita than any other. The distribution of wealth
 among the apparently richer, operates to make individuals heap wealth
 together in greater quantities (8).</p>
<p class="footnote"><i>Malthus</i> himself wrote his classical work under
 the influence of a very intelligible reaction (1st ed., 1798; 2d ed.,
 1803). For a whole generation, the European public had had no other view
 broached but that the tree of human kind might keep on growing even until
 it reached the heavens, if care were only taken to manure the ground, to
 water the roots and prune the branches according to the latest
 world-improving recipes. <i>Malthus</i>, in opposition thereto, called
 attention to the limits placed by nature to the number of mankind. He
 demonstrated that it was not merely arbitrary laws which opposed the
 Utopian happiness of all, but in part the niggardliness of nature; and in
 greater part the passions and sins of men themselves. If he sometimes
 described the limits as narrower than they really are, and if an
 occasional coarse expression escaped him, we need not wonder. His polemic
 was well founded, and he was at the time still a young man (born 1766, ob.
 1834). He modified much in the later editions of his work. For instance,
 he stopped the unsavory sentence in which he says that a man born into the
 world already occupied, whose family cannot support him, and whose labor
 society does not need, has not the smallest right to demand the smallest
 particle of food, and is really superfluous in the world; that there is no
 place for him at the great banquet of nature; that nature bids him go
 hence and does not hesitate herself to execute the command. <i>P.
 Leroux</i> in a small pamphlet in answer to <i>Malthus</i>, quotes this
 sentence at least forty times. Moreover, <i>Möser</i>, who certainly is
 not considered a misanthrope, was not only acquainted with the Malthusian
 law, but develops it in words, and with consequences which strongly recall
 the very words which raised such a storm against <i>Malthus</i>. Compare
 Patr. Phant. I, 42; II, 1; IV, 15 (against vaccination); V, 26.</p>
<p class="footnote">The opinions of political economists in our own day
 are, as might be expected, divided on some of Malthus' expressions and on
 his practical counsels. He has indeed but few such one-sided followers as
 <i>Th. Chalmers</i>, On Political Economy in Connexion with the moral
 State and moral Prospects of Society, 1832. Malthus' fundamental views,
 however, are truly scientific. (Κτῆμα ἐς ἀεὶ!<a id="fnanchor_TN75"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN75">[TN
 75]</a>) Compare <i>Baudrillart</i>, Manuel, 424 seq., and <i>A
 Walker</i>, Science of Wealth, who strangely enough (452) opposes Malthus,
 and yet is (458) virtually of the same opinion. Even the better class of
 socialists base themselves on the same view, without, however, thanking
 Malthus for it. Thus for instance, <i>K. Marlo</i>, System der
 Weltökonomie (1848, 52), passim. For an excellent history of the theory of
 population, see <i>R. Mohl</i>, Gesch. und Literatur der
 Staatswissenschaften, III, 409 ff. (1858).</p>
<p class="p2 center"><a id="S243"></a>SECTION CCXLIII.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 289]</span></p>
<p class="center smaller">OPPONENTS OF MALTHUS.</p>
<p>Of Malthus' opponents, John Stuart Mill has said, that a confused notion
of the causes which, at most times and places, <span class="pagenum">[Pg
290]</span> keep the actual increase of mankind so far behind their
capacity for increase, has every now and then given birth to some ephemeral
theory, speedily forgotten; as if the law of the increase of population
were a different one under different circumstances, and as if the fecundity
of the human species, <span class="pagenum">[Pg 291]</span> by direct
divine decree, was in keeping with the wants of society for the time
being.<a id="fnanchor_243-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_243-1">[243-1]</a></p>
<p>The majority of such theories are based, on the proof that Malthus'
description of one stage of civilization is not true of another, although
the great discoverer, who, with his admirable many-sidedness, had
investigated the law of population in and throughout all the stages of
civilization, had, as a rule, himself given due weight to all of this. The
objection of unwarranted generalization applies to Malthus much less than
to the majority of his opponents. Since, for instance, in young colonies,
even the natural forces, which are in themselves limited or exhaustible,
afford a wide field of operation for a long time; many American writers
have supposed that labor alone was the source of wealth, and that, to say
the least, wealth should increase in the same ratio as mankind; and even in
a still greater ratio, since the division of labor grows easier as
population increases in density.<a id="fnanchor_243-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_243-2">[243-2]</a> But here it is forgotten <span class="pagenum">[Pg
292]</span> that in every instance of economic production, there are many
factors engaged, each one of which can take the place of another only up to
a certain point. There are others, especially Grahame and Carey,<a id="fnanchor_243-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_243-3">[243-3]</a> who allude to the possibility of emigration,
which is still so far from being exhausted. But Malthus had nothing to say
of the impossibility of emigration. He spoke only of the great difficulties
in its way. (III. ch. 4.) There are many writers who would wish simply to
ship emigrants off, like a great many doctors who send their patients away
to die! (§ 259 ff.) When Sadler says that human prolificacy, circumstances
remaining the same, is inversely as the density of population, he uses, to
say the least, a very inaccurate mode of expression.<a id="fnanchor_243-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_243-4">[243-4]</a> The grain of truth <span class="pagenum">[Pg
293]</span> hidden in this assertion does certainly not come from Gray's
theory, that in the higher stages of civilization, the better living usual
is a hinderance to the increase of population, and that the prevailing
influence of large cities increases mortality;<a id="fnanchor_243-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_243-5">[243-5]</a> but from influences, or, to speak more correctly,
from free human considerations, on which no one has thrown so much light as
Malthus. And indeed, where is the man who has better understood or more
warmly recommended the "aristocratic" impulse which should, in well ordered
civil society, hold the sexual instinct in equilibrium?<a id="fnanchor_243-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_243-6">[243-6]</a> Malthus himself pleasantly derides his
opponents, who, to explain how the same rifle, charged with the same powder
and provided with the same ball, produces an effect varying with the nature
of the object at which it is fired, prefer, instead of calculating the
force of resistance of the latter, to take refuge in a mysterious faculty
by virtue of which the powder has a different explosive force, according to
the greater or less resistance the ball meets when it strikes.<a id="fnanchor_243-7"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_243-7">[243-7]</a> The peculiarity of Godwin's polemics may be
inferred from the fact that he considered it very doubtful <span class="pagenum">[Pg 294]</span> whether the population of England had
increased during the four preceding generations; and that he traces the
increase of the population of the United States to the influence of
emigration almost exclusively, and allows the desertion of whole English
regiments in 1812 ff. to play a part in accounting for that increase.<a id="fnanchor_243-8"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_243-8">[243-8]</a></p>
<p>Malthus has been accused of rejoicing over the evils which are wont to
decimate surplus population; but the same charge might be brought against
those physicians who trace the diseases back to the causes that produce
them. He has also been branded as the enemy of the lower classes, spite of
the fact that he is the very first who took a scientific interest in their
prosperity.<a id="fnanchor_243-9"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_243-9">[243-9]</a> As John Stuart Mill has
said, the idea that all human progress must at last end in misery was so
far from Malthus' mind, that it can be thoroughly combated only by carrying
Malthus' principles into practice.<a id="fnanchor_243-10"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_243-10">[243-10]</a></p>

 men, the greater becomes the power of the latter to give direction to
 natural forces with an ever accelerated movement. So also <i>Fontenay</i>,
 in the Journal des Economistes, Oct., 1850, says: <i>un nombre de
 travailleurs doublé produit plus du double et ne consomme pas le double de
 ce que produisaient et consommaient les travailleurs de l'époque
 précédente</i>. Even <i>Bastiat</i> inclines to the same over-estimation
 of one factor of production. He promises in the introduction to his
 Harmonies économiques to prove the proposition: <i>toutes choses égales
 d'ailleurs, la densité croissante de population équivaut à une facilité
 croissante de production</i>. (Absolutely it is true, but whether

 to Jacobin measures in opposition to the reforms advocated by Huskisson,
 Peel and Wellington. Like Sadler, <i>A. Guillard</i>, Eléments de

 Saxony, population has for a long time increased most rapidly, in those
 places where it is already densest. Compare <i>Engel,</i> loc. cit. The
 five German kingdoms and Mecklenburg-Strelitz hold the same relative rank,
 on a ten-year average, in relation to the number of births that they do to

<p>In the case of those wild tribes which can only use the forces of nature
by way of occupation, the small extent of the field of food is filled up by
even a very sparse population. And the principal means by which population
is there limited are the following: the overburthening and ill treatment of
the women,<a id="fnanchor_244-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_244-1">[244-1]</a> by which the

conjunction with cannibalism in many tribes.<a id="fnanchor_244-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_244-6">[244-6]</a> Besides, nations of hunters are frequently decimated
by famine and pestilence, the latter <span class="pagenum">[Pg 297]</span>

famine.<a id="fnanchor_244-7"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_244-7">[244-7]</a></p>
<p>Most negro nations live in such a state of legal insecurity that it is
impossible for a higher civilization with its attendant increase of the
means of subsistence to take root among them. At the same time, their
sexual impulses are very strong.<a id="fnanchor_244-8"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_244-8">[244-8]</a> Here the slave-trade constituted the chief
preventive of over-population. If this traffic were suppressed simply and
no care taken through the instrumentality of commerce and of missions to
improve the moral and economical condition of the negroes, the only
probable but questionable gain would be that the prisoners made in the
numberless wars generated by famine would be murdered instead of being
sold.</p>
<p>Nomadic races, with their universal chivalry, are wont to treat their
women well enough to enable them bear children without any great
hardship.<a id="fnanchor_244-9"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_244-9">[244-9]</a> But the mere use of
natural pasturage can never be carried to great intensity. The transition
to agriculture with its greater yield of food but with the diminished
freedom by which it is accompanied is a thing to which these warlike men
are so averse that it directs the surplus population by the way of
emigration into neighboring civilized countries, where they either obtain
victory, booty and supremacy, or are rapidly subjugated. Such migrations
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 298]</span> are a standing chapter in the history
of all Asiatic kingdoms; they for a long time disturb declining civilized
states, finally conquering them, and begin the same cycle in the new

 In New Holland they are beaten by their husbands even on the day of their
 confinement. Their heads are sometimes covered with countless scars.
 <i>Collins</i> says that for mere pity one might wish a young woman there
 death rather than marriage. (Account of N. S. Wales, 560 ff.) South
 American Indian women actually kill their daughters, with a view of
 improving the condition of women. (<i>Azara</i>, Reisen in S. Amerika, II,
 63.) How the women among the aboriginal inhabitants of North America were
 oppressed is best illustrated by the absence of ornaments among the women,
 while the men were very gaudily decked, and carried small hand-mirrors
 with them. (<i>Prinz Neuwied</i>, N. A. Reise, II, 108 seq.) The early
 decay of female beauty among all barbarous nations is related to the
 ill-treatment they receive.</p>

 frequently bled. (<i>Spix und Martius</i>, Reise, I, 261.) Compare

 The usual coldness, so much spoken of, of the Indians, seems to have an
 economic rather than a physiological cause. At least, it has also been
 observed among the Hottentots. (<i>Levillant</i>, Voyage, I, 12 seq.), and
 under favorable economic conditions the Indians have sometimes increased
 very rapidly. (Lettres édifiantes, VIII, 243.) Whether the practice in
 vogue among the Botocuds to carry the organ of generation continually in a
 rather narrow envelope, or that among the Patachos of lacing the foreskin
 with the tendrils of a plant, is not a "preventive check," quære. Compare

 Compare <i>Machiavelli</i>, at the beginning of his Istoria Fiorentina.
 The migration of the Germani is accounted for simply by the family and
 marriage relations of the Germans, which necessarily favored prolificacy:
 <i>Severa matrimonia ... singulis uxoribus contenti sunt ... septae
 pudicitia ... paucissima adulteria ... publicatae pudicitiae nulla venia
 ... nemo vitia ridet ... numerum liberorum finire, flagitium habetur ...
 sua quemque mater uberibus alit ... sera juverum Venus eoque inexhausta
 pubertas ... quanto plus propinquorum, tanto gratiosior senectus.</i>
<i>Tacit.</i>, Germ., 14. Entirely similar in character were the
 migrations of the Normans, which lasted just as long as the resistance to
 the countries they would invade, seemed to them a matter of less
 difficulty than the transition to a higher civilization in their own
 country. <i>Malthus</i> has corrected the extravagant notions concerning
 the former density of population in the North—the <i>vagina
 nationum</i>, according to Jornandes! (<i>Malthus</i>, I, ch. 6.) Compare,

<p>Most barbarous nations live very unchaste;<a id="fnanchor_245-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_245-1">[245-1]</a> so that, as Tacitus observes, the ancient Germans
were a brilliant exception to the rule.<a id="fnanchor_245-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_245-2">[245-2]</a> Vices of unchastity always limit the otherwise <span class="pagenum">[Pg 299]</span> natural increase of population. Premature
enjoyment exhausts the sources of fruitfulness in the case of many.<a id="fnanchor_245-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_245-3">[245-3]</a> The life of the child conceived in sin is
generally little valued by its parents. Hence the numerous instances of
exposure and infanticide.<a id="fnanchor_245-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_245-4">[245-4]</a> We have already seen how closely, psychologically
speaking, a community of goods is allied to a community of women. (§ 85.)
And, indeed, in the lower stages of civilization, we find as close an
approximation to the latter as to the former; and it is difficult to
believe that, among men living in a state of nudity, the marriage of one
man to one woman could properly exist.<a id="fnanchor_245-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_245-5">[245-5]</a> But it is as little possible to reconcile
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 300]</span> a community of women with density of
population as great national wealth with a community of goods. Any one
acquainted with the condition and capacities of new born children knows
that the weak little flame easily goes out when not nursed by family
care.<a id="fnanchor_245-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_245-6">[245-6]</a></p>
<p>Polygamy also is a hinderance to the increase of population. Abstract
physiology must, indeed, admit that a man may, even without any danger to
his health, generate more children <span class="pagenum">[Pg 301]</span>
than a woman can bear.<a id="fnanchor_245-7"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_245-7">[245-7]</a> But, in reality, the
simultaneous enjoyment of several women leads to excess and early
exhaustion;<a id="fnanchor_245-8"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_245-8">[245-8]</a> and if one of them is
married after the other, the older who might still bear children for a long
time are neglected by the man.<a id="fnanchor_245-9"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_245-9">[245-9]</a> Monogamy is, doubtless, the Creator's law, since

girls born;<a id="fnanchor_245-12"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_245-12">[245-12]</a> but this excess is removed
by the time <span class="pagenum">[Pg 302]</span> that puberty sets in, by
reason of the greater mortality of boys. Only extraordinary conditions
which thin the ranks of males, such as war and emigration, leave a
preponderance of the number of women.<a id="fnanchor_245-13"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_245-13">[245-13]</a> Hence, among barbarous nations, who live in
everlasting strife (§§ 67, 70), polygamy is very generally established. Men
are seldom deterred therefrom by a solicitude concerning what they shall
eat, since the women are treated as slaves, and rather support the men than
are supported by them.<a id="fnanchor_245-14"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_245-14">[245-14]</a> But in the civilized countries of the east, the

 Among the Indian tribes of Terra Firma, the exchange of wives and the

 (<i>Bagert</i>, Nachrichten von der Halbinsel C. 1772.) In many of the

 themselves into so-called <i>arreyo-societies</i>, the object of which was
 the most unlimited intercourse of the sexes (a pair being united generally
 only from 2 to 3 days), and the murder of the new born children. The girls
 principally were murdered, and hence the missionaries at Otaheite (New
 Cytheria) found only 1/5 as many women as men. <i>Chaque femme semble être
 la femme de tous les hommes chaque homme le mari de toutes les femmes.</i>

 The high esteem for woman requisite to true love seems to be almost
 irreconcilable with polygamy. The wife stands to the husband in the
 relation of a mistress; and, in reference to the latter, fidelity has
 scarcely any meaning. The husband also has no confidence in his wife; and
 hence the seclusion of the harem. But the domestic tyrant is easily made
 the slave of a higher power. And what becomes of fraternal love with the
 half-brother feeling of children of different mothers?</p>

 born alive in Lombardy, 1,070 boys; in Bohemia, 1,062; in France, 1,058;

 ratio in 70,000,000 children born alive was as 100 : 105.83. The excess of
 males over females in bastards is smaller than in the case of legitimate
 children, in towns than in the country. Everything considered, the number
 of boys born seems to be greater than the number of girls in proportion as
 the father is in advance of his wife in years. Compare <i>Sadler</i>, Law

 1,001; in England, 1,039; in Holland, 1,038. The majority of the latter
 seems to have diminished everywhere the greater the distance in time from
 the most recent great wars; and to belong only to those age-classes which
 were coeval with those wars. (Preuss. amtliche Tabellen für 1849, I, 292.)
 In the United States there were, 1800-1844, for every 1,000 women,
 1,033-1,050 men; mainly accounted for by large immigration. Between 1819
 and 1855 the immigration was 2,713,391 men and 1,720,305 women. (<i>W.

 equilibrium: the <b>greater</b> the preponderance of the number of women,

 The so-called <i>Populationistikers</i> are wont to distinguish between
 the average and probable duration of life (<i>vie moyenne—vie
 probable</i>); and understand by the former the number of years which, on
 an average, have been accorded to one deceased; by the latter, the number
 of years after the expiration of which one-half of a given number of human
 beings have disappeared. If <i>x</i> deceased persons have lived an
 aggregate of <i>s</i> years, their average duration of life =
 <i>s</i>/<i>x</i>. In the case of a whole people, indeed, even the
 many-years' average of the duration of life of those deceased expresses
 the true average duration of life only when (a rare case) the aggregate
 population remains stationary. For, when the population is increasing, the
 average age of the deceased is smaller than the average duration of life,
 and, when population is decreasing, larger. In the saddest case of all,
 when there are no births whatever, and the nation is gradually dying out,
 there would be an increase from year to year of the average age. In all
 such cases, strictly speaking, only the actual observation and following
 up of those born, until they die; can afford a safe result. This is
 <i>Hermann's</i> method, introduced into Bavaria since 1835. Compare the
 XIII. and XVII. numbers of the official Bavarian statistics with <i>G.
 Meyer's</i> criticism in <i>Hildebrand's</i> Jahrbüchern, 1867, I. And
 indeed <i>Hopf</i>, Preuss. Statist. Zeitschr., says that a complete table
 of mortality can be made, according to the best method, only after
 centuries of observation.</p>
<p class="footnote">Compare <i>Kopf</i>, in the 3d edition of
 <i>Kolb's</i> Handbuch der Statistik, and the solid works of <i>G. F.
 Knapp</i>, Ueber die Ermittelung der Sterblichkeit (1868) and Die
 Sterblichkeit in Sachsen (1869). <i>Price's</i> mode of calculation of
 which <i>Deparcieux</i> is the real author, which divides the number of
 the living by the arithmetical mean of the number of births and deaths is
 not only inaccurate (<i>Meyer</i>, loc. cit., 43 ff.) but erroneous in
 principle, since it allows two countries of equal population to be the
 same, the one of which has 120,000 births and a mortality of 80,000, and
 the other, on the contrary, 80,000 births and a mortality of 120,000.
 <i>Engel</i> recommends as the measure of real vitality the ratio between
 the "living years" and the "dead years," meaning by the former the sum of
 the years which those still living have lived through, and by the latter
 the sum of the years lived through by those who have died within a given
 period. (Preuss. Statist. Zeitschr., 1861, 348 ff.) But the inference
 which may be drawn from a high or a low average of life is altogether
 ambiguous. A high average may as well be produced by a great mortality
 among children as by a favorable mortality among those of mature age; and
 a low average as well by a relatively small number of births as by a
 relatively short duration of life. (<i>Meyer</i>, loc. cit., 23, 24.)</p>

<i>Necker</i>, De l'Administration des Finances de la France, 1784, I, 205
 ff., gives for 1771-80 the average number of births, per annum, 940,935;
 of deaths, 818,391; the population at 24,229,000. <i>Legoyt</i>, Statist.
 Comp., estimates the last, in 1784, at at least 26,748,843, probably even
 at 28,718,000. During the period, 1844-53, 35,000,000 to 36,000,000
 Frenchmen had only about as many births (956,317) and deaths (815,723) as
 a much smaller population before the Revolution—the latter numbers,
 according to official estimation, omitting the still-born—which
 <i>Necker</i> also scarcely took into consideration. <i>C'est la
 différence entre un peuple de prolétaires et une nation, dont les deux
 tiers jouissent des bienfaits de la propriété. (Moreau de Jonnès).</i> In
 France, there was one death, in 1784, on every 30 living; in 1801, on
 every 35.8 living; in 1834-5, on every 38 living; in 1844, on every 39.9
 living; in 1855-57 (average), on every 41.1 living; in 1860-65 (average),
 on every 43.7 living. It is also probable, that the average duration of
 life in France increased from the fact that, from 1800 to 1807, the number
 of persons subject to conscription was only 45 per cent. of the whole
 corresponding number of births; but that from 1822 to 1825 it was 61 per
 cent. (<i>Bernoulli</i>, Populationistik, 452.) On Paris alone, see

<i>Wappäus</i>, Allg. Bevölkerungsstatistik. In Prussia, in the less
 cultured provinces (the eastern), the mortality and number of births is
 greatest; but in the whole country the relative mortality seems to have
 remained stationary since 1748. (<i>Engel</i>, Preuss. Statist. Zeitschr.,
 1861, 336 seq.) And even the average age of the deceased decreased even
 between 1820 and 1860 (344 ff.) In Berlin alone, the arithmetical mean of
 the number of births and deaths shows no improvement, at least (loc. cit.
 1862, 195).</p>

 In Geneva, where there have been almost uninterrupted tables of mortality,
 giving the age at the time of death, the average duration of life during
 the 2d half of the 16th century is estimated at 21-1/6 years; during the
 17th century, at 25¾ years; from 1701 to 1750, at 32-7/12 years; from 1750
 to 1800, at 34½ years; from 1814 to 1833, at 40-2/3 years. Compare
 <i>Mallet</i>, Recherches historiques et statistiques sur la Population de
 Genève, 1837, 98 ff., 104 ff., and <i>Bernouilli</i>, Schweiz, Archiv.,
 II, 77; <i>per contra, d'Ivernois</i>, sur la Mortalité proportionelle des
 peuples considérée comme Mesure de leur Aisance et Civilization, 1833, 12
 ff. But little can be inferred from this, on account of the large
 immigration, of adults for the most part. Geneva is said to have had, in
 the 16th century, never much more than 13,000 inhabitants; at the end of
 the 17th century it had 17,000; in 1789, 26,000; between 1695 and 1795
 there was an increase of 6,000 at least from abroad. (<i>Bernouilli</i>,
 Populationistik, 369 seq.) Compare <i>Wappäus</i> in the Götting.
 Gesellsch. der Wissensch. Bd., VIII, 1860, who, however, as well as
 <i>Neison</i>, Contributions to Vital Statistics, VI ff., is too skeptical
 as regards modern progress in vitality.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_246-6"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_246-6" class="pginternal">[246-6]</a>
 Higher civilization, indeed, instead of leading to higher vitality, may
 lead to immoderate toil and immoderate enjoyment. (<i>Schäffle</i>, in the
 D. Vierteljahrsschrift, April, 1862, 340.) <i>Engel</i> says that, in
 general, life is more intense in our day, and hence leads to a more rapid
 exhaustion of individual life-force. (Preuss. Statist. Ztschr., 1862, 53.)
 According to English experience of the well-fed classes, those have the
 greatest duration of life who otherwise live in modest circumstances.
 Thus, for instance, clergymen thirty years of age have still an average
 expectation of life of 39.49 years; members of the learned professions,
 38.86; country gentlemen, 40.22; members of the aristocracy, 37.31;
 princes of the blood, only 34.04; sovereigns, only 27.16 (Statist.
 Journal, 1859, 356 ff.); while agricultural laborers, who have sufficient
 means and intelligence to participate in the so-called friendly societies,
 have an expectation of life of 40.6 years after their thirtieth year.
 (<i>Neison</i>, loc. cit.) On the whole, it seems to be in harmony with
 the democratic leveling tendencies of our own age, that the better care of
 children and of the sick has lengthened short lives, and that the unrest
 of the times has shortened the long lives, although the level of the
 general average continually rises, notwithstanding. Thus, in Geneva, the
 proportion of those who outlived their thirtieth year was: in the 16th
 century, after 1549, 29.87; in the 17th century, 37.29; in the 18th
 century, 49.39; in the 19th century, until 1833, 58.85 per cent. of the
 number of births. On the other hand, the expectation of life of those who
 had attained their 80th year, was in these four centuries respectively
 6.22, 5.87, 4.40 and 3.84 years. (<i>Mallet</i>, l. c., and Statist.
 Journal, 1851, 316 ff.) In keeping with this is, that according to
 <i>Guy's</i> researches, the average duration of life of the English
 peerage and baronetage was, in 1500-1550, 71.27 years; 1550-1600, 68.25
 years; 1600-1650, 63.95 years; 1650-1700, 62.40 years; 1700-1745, 64.13
 years. (Statist. Journal, 1845, 74.) However, we may most directly infer a
 favorable condition of things from the diminished mortality of children,
 for the reason that this, far more directly than the mortality of adults,
 is conditioned by the quality of food. The younger a child is, the more
 exclusively is its life-force the product of these two factors: the
 physical constitution of its parents and the care bestowed upon it.
 Compare <i>F. J. Neumann</i>, Die Gestaltung der mittleren Lebensdauer in
 Preussen, 1865, 26 ff. In Prussia, in 1751-60, only 312 in 1,000 outlived
 their tenth year; in 1861-70, 633 in 1,000. Yet, since 1856, the mortality
 of children has again begun to increase. (<i>Knapp</i>, Mittheilungen des
 Statist. Bureaus, VIII, p. 8.)</p>

<i>Duvillard</i>, Analyse ou Tableau de l'Influence da la petite Vérole,
 1806, is of opinion that before vaccination only 4 per cent. of those over
 30 years of age were spared by the small-pox; that two-thirds of all
 new-born children were attacked by the disease sooner or later, and that
 from one-eighth to one-seventh of those attacked died; and of small
 children even one-third. Hence, in many countries, the average duration of
 life was increased 3½ years by reason of vaccination. In London, between
 1770 and 1779, of 1,000 deaths, 102 were caused by the small-pox; in from
 1830 to 1836, only 25 in 1,000. (<i>Porter</i>, Progress of the Nation, I,
 1, 39.) In Berlin, between 1792 and 1801, 4,999 persons died of the
 small-pox; between 1812 and 1822, only 555. (<i>Casper.</i>) That this is
 really a consequence of vaccination is proved by the facts of the Chemnitz
 small-pox epidemic of 1870-71, during which, in four of the streets
 principally visited by it, 9 per cent. were taken ill. Of 4,375 persons
 who had been vaccinated, 2.12 per cent. were attacked; of 644 who were not
 vaccinated, 54.38 per cent. Of those attacked, 2.1 per cent. of the former
 and 11.3 per cent. of the latter died. (Leipzig Tageblatt, 5 Mai,
 1871.)</p>

 Among the earliest institutions of medical police are the following: the
 Swedish Collegium medicum under Charles XI; the Prussian, 1724; the
 Danish, 1740; the quarantine law of Louis XIV., of 1683; the Parisian
 bureau of nurses, 1715; lying-in establishments since 1728; French
 institutions for the saving of drowned persons, 1740; English institutions
 for the saving of persons in cases of apparent death, 1744; bathing
 largely promoted by government since the eighteenth century; prohibition
 by Maria Theresa of burial in churches and of locating cemeteries too near
 dwelling houses, in 1778. Even <i>Thomasius</i>, De Jure Principum circa
 Sepultur., § 8, had advised this; and, in Italy, <i>Fr. Patricius</i>, De

 In France, the number of deaths in the cheap years, 1816 and 1819,
 amounted to an average of 755,877; of the dear years, 1817 and 1818, to an
 average of 750,065. (Ann. d'Economie politique, 1847, 333.) Thus, the same
 scarcity in Pomerania increased its otherwise smaller mortality relatively
 less than in Posen. (<i>Hildebrand's</i> Jahrbb. 1872, I, 292.) It is a
 good sign that in Altenburg, between 1835 and 1864, the variation in the
 price of corn had no influence on its mortality, although the number of
 marriages and of births was conditioned by it. (<i>v. Scheel</i> in

 ages! Certainly, as it does now in the East Indies; since, when of those
 really attacked by the disease among ourselves so many die, we cannot
 attribute our small number of deaths from cholera to the smaller intensity
 of the disease or to the greater skill of our doctors, but chiefly to the
 better nourishment of our people, to their better dwellings and greater
 cleanliness. Compare <i>Heberden</i>, On the Increase and Decrease of

 can infer the increased health of the people, is very much doubted by the
 aged <i>laudatores temporis acti</i>. They would have us believe that it
 is possible that the prolongation of the average of human life is to be
 explained by taking into account the case of numerous valetudinarians who
 formerly died early, but who are <i>now</i> preserved to drag out a
 miserable existence. The relative number of those who have died of old age
 did not noticeably increase between 1816 and 1860 either in Berlin or in
 the Prussian state. (<i>Engel</i>, Zeitschr., 1862, 222.) Compare, per

<p>There is found to be in most states, where a decrease in mortality has
been observed, a diminished number of births likewise.<a id="fnanchor_247-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_247-1">[247-1]</a> This, indeed, happens necessarily only in the case
in which the means of subsistence either do not increase at all, or in a
less degree than mortality has decreased. Thus, towards <span class="pagenum">[Pg 310]</span> the end of the 18th century, Norway was the
country where the increase and decrease of the population were most
remarkable for their smallness. There was only one death between 1775 and
1784 for every 48 living persons; but, at the same time, only one marriage
for every 130 living.<a id="fnanchor_247-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_247-2">[247-2]</a> The organization
of labor was so little developed among the Norwegians, especially in the
absence of important cities, the industries of which might have been able
to absorb the surplus population, that almost every one of its inhabitants
was in a condition to calculate in advance whether or not he would have
enough to support a family. A person born in the country remained generally
in his native village all his life. To found a family he had either to own
a peasant's estate himself or wait until one of the day laborer's huts
(<i>Kathe</i>), of which there were several attached to each such estate,
was vacant. A too large family would certainly have died of hunger in the
winter time. The clear sober sense of the people recognized this fact, and
all the farm houses of the peasants were without any appreciable injury to
morality filled with unmarried servants of both sexes who were, indeed,
supplied with clothes and food but who at the same time were indolent and
incapable of advancement.<a id="fnanchor_247-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_247-3">[247-3]</a> Where a nation's economy is rapidly advancing, there
is no necessity why the most natural and when properly directed the most
beneficent human impulse should be sacrificed to a higher average duration
of life. But if this must be, when the distribution of the national
resources is pretty nearly equal, it is <span class="pagenum">[Pg
311]</span> not so much the number of marriages as the average fruitfulness
of marriages that will diminish; that is as many persons as before may
enter the married state but most of them are obliged either to postpone
doing so until a later age, which places a greater interval between
generation and generation, and causes the number of those living at any one
time to decrease; or they cease to procreate children at an earlier period
in their married life. The latter is found especially in France.<a id="fnanchor_247-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_247-4">[247-4]</a> <a id="fnanchor_247-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_247-5">[247-5]</a> <span class="pagenum">[Pg 312-13]</span> But, on the
other hand, where the distribution of the national resources is very
unequal, the rich may afterwards as well as before continue to follow out
their inclination to marry at as early a day and age as they wish; but the
less fortunate must remain unmarried through life. Here, therefore, the
average number of children to a marriage does not diminish; but the
aggregate number of marriages does.<a id="fnanchor_247-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_247-6">[247-6]</a> If the relative frequency of marriages in most
European countries has diminished during the last century, the cause has
been in part directly the long duration of life of married couples. Hence,
we are not always warranted in consequence, to infer a diminished number of
existing marriages.<a id="fnanchor_247-7"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_247-7">[247-7]</a></p>
<p>In many countries, it has been recently observed that the average number
of persons to a family is a decreasing one. Thus for, instance, in 1840, in
Holland, there were to every <span class="pagenum">[Pg 314]</span> hundred
families 497 persons, in 1850, only 481; in Saxony, in 1832, 460; in 1840,
only 443; in Bavaria, in 1827, 480, in 1846, only 448. In cities also the
average size of families is usually smaller than in the country.<a id="fnanchor_247-8"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_247-8">[247-8]</a> This is intimately connected with this other
fact that in the higher stages of civilization a larger number of
independent households consists of single persons in contradistinction to
married couples.<a id="fnanchor_247-9"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_247-9">[247-9]</a> <a id="fnanchor_247-10"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_247-10">[247-10]</a></p>

 In modern times, the intellectual and legal conditions which existed in
 Norway have been loosened to a great extent, and population in that
 country has, in consequence, made rapid advances. In 1769 the population
 was only 723,000; in 1855, it was 1,490,000. But the above customs for the
 most part continue still. Between 1831 and 1835, there was one marriage a
 year for every 138 living persons. The relative number of marriages is
 smaller than before. In 1769, there were, in every 1,000,376 married
 persons; in 1801, 347; in 1825, 345; in 1835, 322. In 1805, there were
 only 63 illegitimate births to every 1,000 births; in 1835, the proportion
 was 71.5 in every 1,000. (<i>Blom</i>, Statistik Con N., II, 168,

<p class="footnote">But it must not be overlooked here, that the Flemish
 provinces of Belgium had been for a long time in a sad economic condition.
 (<i>Horn</i>, Studien, I, 75 ff.) No less characteristic of the well-being
 of a people and their providence in entering into the married state is the
 relative age at which they contract marriage. If we divide ages into four
 classes (up to the 30th year, between 31 and 45, between 46 and 60, and
 after 60), we find, for instance, that from 1841 to 1845, there were in
 West Flanders 585 per 1,000 marriages between persons of the same
 age-class, 305 in which the husband, and 110 in which the wife belonged to
 an older class; in Namur, on the other hand, 683, 234 and 83. In dear
 years, the relative number of marriages between persons belonging to
 different age-classes, and the relative difference in age of parties to
 the marriage contract increases.</p>
<p class="footnote">And so, the frequency of second marriages of widows
 and widowers is no favorable symptom of the facility of founding a family.
 Naturally every woman prefers a man who was never married before to a
 widower; and every man a maiden to a widow; but where there is a want of
 room to establish a new household, the possession of such one by a widower
 may readily preponderate over all counter considerations. Thus, for
 instance, in the Flemish provinces of Belgium, of 1,000 widowers, from 365
 to 395 marry again; in the Wallonic, only from 293 to 308. Of 1,000
 brides, 98 are widows in West Flanders, and in Namur, 41. A similar
 proportion in Bavaria between the Palatinate and the hither-districts.
 (<i>Hermann</i>, Bewegung der Bevölkerung in Bayern, p. 14.) The less the
 frequency of marriage in general, the greater is the relative probability
 of second marriage for widows and widowers; and hence, in years of
 scarcity, the latter relatively increase. (<i>Horn</i>, Studien, I, 201
 ff.) Sometimes this increase is absolute: in Austria, during the cheap
 year 1852, there were 231,900 marriages between persons never before
 married, and 85,000 in which at least one of the contracting parties had
 been married before. On the other hand, during the dear year 1855, there
 were only 156,000 of the former and 89,000 of the latter. Something
 analogous, observed in antiquity. (<i>Pausan.</i>, II, 21, 8; X, 38, 6;
 <i>Propert.</i>, II, 11, 36.) <i>Tacitus</i>, Germ., 19, describes the
 moral feelings of the ancient Germans as averse to the second marriage of
 widows, and he apparently approves it.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_247-5"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_247-5" class="pginternal">[247-5]</a>
 In 19 European countries, with an aggregate population of 121,000,000, the
 number of the married amounted to an average of 34.88 per cent. of the
 whole population. France is at the head with 38.94 per cent. (1866), even
 40.5. In these countries, of all adults, there is a percentage of 65.98
 who marry. France is here, also, at the head, with a percentage of 73.58.
 And the number of the unmarried has continually decreased in
 post-revolutionary France. In 1806, there were only 35.84 per cent. of the
 population married. (<i>Wappäus</i>, A. Bevölk erungsstatistik, II, 219,
 223, 229.) In relation also to the frequency of first marriages and of
 marriage at the proper age, France is the best situated country.
 (<i>Haushofer</i>, Lehr- und Handbuch der Statistik, 40 ff.) But at the
 same time, in what concerns the fruitfulness of marriage, it is the
 farthest behind; and since 1780 prolificacy has continually decreased
 there. Thus, 1800-1815, 3.93 legitimate children to a marriage; 1856-60,
 only 3.03; 1861-6, again 3.08. (<i>Legoyt</i> in the Journal des Econ.
 Oct. 1870, 28.) How little this depends upon physiological causes may be
 inferred from the fact that <i>Strabo</i> commends the women of the Gallic
 race for their peculiar adaptability to bearing and rearing children. (IV,
 178, 196.) The "prudential checks" must play a principal part in producing
 a low birth rate. (Statist. Journal, 1866, 262), as we find in France</p>

<p class="footnote">That, however, the shorter duration and smaller
 fruitfulness of marriage by no means necessarily accompany one another,
 France also proves, since it possesses the longer average duration of
 marriage: 26.4 years against 20.7 in Prussia. (<i>Wappäus</i>, II, 311,
 315.)</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_247-6"></a>

 The proportion of the married to the whole population declined in Prussia
 from 35.09 in 1816, to 33.09 per cent. in 1852; in Sweden, from 36.41 in
 1751 to 32.59 per cent. in 1855; in Norway, from 37.60 per cent. in 1769
 to 32.21 per cent. in 1855; in Saxony, from 35.52 per cent. in 1834, to
 34.98 per cent. in 1849. (<i>Wappäus</i>, II, 229.) If all who are at
 least 20 years of age be considered competent to marry, there are of every
 1,000 thus competent in Belgium, 520 actually married; in the Flemish
 provinces alone, 489; in the most favorably situated Wallonic, 554.
 (<i>Horn</i>, Bevölk. Studien, I, 139 ff.) In Rome, under Augustus, the
 proportion was much less satisfactory. In the higher classes, a large
 majority did not marry at all. (<i>Dio. Cass.</i>, I, VI, 1.)</p>

 In Halle, in 1700, there was one marriage for every 77 of the population;
 in 1715, for every 99; in 1735, for every 140; in 1755, for every 167. In
 Leipzig, in 1620, there was one for every 82; 1741-1756, for every 118;
 1868, for every 92.8. In Augsburg, 1510, one in 86; in 1610, in 108; in

 Halberstadt, Cleve, Mark, Munden, Brandenburg, Pomerania<a id="fnanchor_TN83"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN83">[TN 83]</a> and Prussia had, about the end of the seventeenth
 century, one marriage per annum for every 76-95 of the population; the
 Prussian monarchy, 1822-1828, one marriage for every 109-121. Compare
 <i>Sussmilch</i> Göttl. Ordnung, I., 131, ff., <i>Schubert</i> Staatskunde
 des preuss. Staates I., 364. In France, 1801-1805, there was one marriage
 per annum in every 137 living; in 1821-5, for every 129; in 1831-35, for
 every 127; in 1842-51, for every 125.39; in 1860, for every 124.7.</p>

 In Prussia, in 1849, there were in every one hundred families in the
 cities, 492 individuals; in the country, 512. In Belgium, in 1846, 459 and
 497 respectively. (<i>Horn</i>, Bevölk. Studien, I, 88, ff.) In France, in
 1853, in the cities, 358; in Paris alone, 299. In the Zollverein, the
 number of individuals in a family increased in 1852-55, 5.81 per cent.;
 the population only 3.02 per cent.; the population of those over fourteen
 years of age, by 4.41 per cent.; of minors by 1.02 per cent. Only in
 Saxony and the cities of Hanover was the reverse the case. (<i>v.

<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_247-9"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_247-9" class="pginternal">[247-9]</a>
 Thus, for instance, in Belgium, for every 100 households, there are 74
 marriages; in the cities of Belgium, 70; in the Belgian country parishes,
 75; in Prussia in 1849, 84. (<i>Horn</i>, I, 93 seq.) It is estimated that
 in Prussia, only 3 per cent. of the adult population live outside of the
 family. (<i>Viebahn</i>, II, 273.)</p>

 It is strange that <i>Süssmilch</i>, Göttl. Ordnung, I, § 13, considers
 mortality an unalterable law, while he fully recognizes the social grounds
 which caused the frequency and prolificacy of marriages to vary (I, § 56,
 99).</p>
<p class="p2 center"><a id="S248"></a>SECTION CCXLVIII.</p>
<p class="center smaller">HISTORY OF POPULATION.—NUMBER OF BIRTHS AND
DEATHS.</p>
<p>So far as the mere number of the population is concerned, it is
obviously a matter of indifference whether there are annually 1,000 births
and 800 deaths, or 2,000 births and 1,800 deaths. But we see in the former
an element of higher civilization,<a id="fnanchor_248-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_248-1">[248-1]</a> especially, on account of the conditions which
determine it. It can occur only where even the most numerous, that is the
lower class, feel other wants than those of the mere means of existence and
of the satisfaction of the sexual instinct: wants, duties which probably
could not be satisfied in a state of marriage <span class="pagenum">[Pg
315]</span> thoughtlessly entered into; where the virtues both of foresight
and self-control are very generally practiced.</p>
<p>And then let us consider the consequences. The efficacy of the
repressive hinderances to over-population either consists in immoral acts
or easily leads to immorality. Until a "surplus" child has died, what a
series of troubles for good parents, and what a chain of evil deeds for bad
ones, to say nothing of the poor child itself.</p>
<p>Further, every man, no matter how short or long his life, requires a
large advance of capital and trouble which he has later to return to
society through the activity of his riper years. If he dies before his
maturity, this advance has been made in vain. The more, therefore, the
population of a country, in order to maintain itself within the bounds of
its field of food, has to calculate on the death of children, the greater
is this loss.<a id="fnanchor_248-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_248-2">[248-2]</a> Hence, from a
national-economic point of view, it is to be considered a great advance,
that in England in 1780, there was one death among its people under 20
years of age in every 76 of the population, in 1801, in every 96, in 1830,
in every 124, in 1833, one only in every 137. (<i>Porter.</i>) Lastly, the
longer the average duration of life of a child the greater, other
circumstances remaining the same, the number of grown people as compared
with that of the children; but grown people are, <span class="pagenum">[Pg
316]</span> as a rule, independent, capable of self-defense, economically
productive, competent to discharge all the rights and duties of
citizenship, while children are dependent, incapable of self-defense,
unproductive, immature. Only he who knows the relative numbers of the
different age-classes of a nation can draw fruitful conclusions from the
data per capita relating to taxation, from the statistics of crime,
suicides, illegitimate births, of school-children, etc., or judge correctly
of a locality's military contingent.<a id="fnanchor_248-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_248-3">[248-3]</a> <a id="fnanchor_248-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_248-4">[248-4]</a> Here, indeed, it should not be overlooked that in
the highest age-classes, human beings return in many respects to the
helplessness of childhood. Yet, as a rule, to reach a good old age is
generally considered a personal good fortune; and the existence of a great
many aged persons in a country, if not in itself an advantageous element in
its economy, may, nevertheless, be called a pleasing symptom.<a id="fnanchor_248-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_248-5">[248-5]</a> On an average there is only one person over
sixty to every twelve under fifteen years of age. (<i>J. G. Hoffmann.</i>)
We may, hence, readily measure what an advantage France possesses in this,
that in 1861, in every 1,000 inhabitants, only 273 were under fifteen years
of age, 524 between sixteen and fifty, the most vigorous years of life, and
203 over fifty years old. The average age of the French population was
31.06 years against 27.22 in Sardinia and 25.32 in Ireland.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 317]</span>However, a positively unfavorable
conclusion from a relatively large number of children in a nation should
not be drawn except in the case of a people the limits of whose field of
food cannot be extended. (§ 239.) Where the nation's economy has a rapid
growth, as for instance in young colonies, the comparatively easy rearing
of children which there obtains, without any corresponding mortality, is
not so much considered a burthen<a id="fnanchor_248-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_248-6">[248-6]</a> as a symptom of their good fortune and <span class="pagenum">[Pg 318]</span> even a positive good.<a id="fnanchor_248-7"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_248-7">[248-7]</a> On the other hand, of the Belgian provinces, for
instance, suffering Flanders had relatively the smallest number of
children, because it had the largest child-mortality.<a id="fnanchor_248-8"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_248-8">[248-8]</a></p>
<p>Almost all the signs which, according to the above paragraphs,
distinguish a higher stage of civilization from a lower, may be shown
within the limits of the same age and nation to characterize the upper
classes as compared with the lower. We may even claim that the greater
foresight and self-control of the former in the matter of marriage and in
the procreation of children, since the abolition of the greater number of
legal advantages of class, are by far the most important of the elements
constituting their superiority over the latter. The word proletariat, from
<i>proles</i>, means first of all, having many children

<i>Rossi</i>, Cours d'Economie politique, I, 371, estimates the cost of
 bringing up a child to its 16th year at a minimum of 1,000 francs. Hence,
 a country with 1,000,000 births annually, in which only 50 per cent. reach
 that age, would lose 500,000,000 francs per annum. However, over one-third
 of the children in question die in the first years of childhood, and the
 rest do not reach on an average their 16th year, but die between the age
 of 7 and 8: <i>Bernouilli</i>, Populationistik, 259. <i>Engel</i>
 estimates Saxony's "man-capital" at 4 times the value of all the land in
 the country, and at 10 times the value of all movable property. (Sächs.,
 Statist. Zeitschr., 1855, No. 9. Preuss. Statist. Zeitschr., 1861, 324.)
 One of the chief advocates of the view that there is an investment of
 capital in every child is <i>Chadwick</i> in the opening address delivered
 by him before an English learned society at Cambridge: Statist. Journal,
 Dec., 1862. Lancashire alone pays a penalty per annum for preventable
 deaths of £4,000,000, for the funeral and medical expenses; to say nothing
 of the capital lost (506).</p>

 this relation, between the productive and unproductive years of life. Thus
 it should not be forgotten, when reading of the greater mortality of the
 poor quarters of Paris, that strangers who are for the most part in the
 vigorous years of life, live there least of all.</p>

 In Russia, it seems that only 36 per cent. of all those born outlive their
 20th year; in England, 55 per cent. (<i>Porter</i>, Progress, ch. I, 29.)
 The Russian peasants are said to have from 10 to 12 children, only about
 one-third of whom grow to maturity, (<i>v. Haxthausen</i>, I, 128.) In the
 United States, the population was in 1820 divided into two nearly equal
 parts as to age, the 16th year of age forming the dividing point; in
 England the same was the case, only the dividing point was 20 years of

<p class="center smaller">HISTORY OF POPULATION.—IN PERIODS OF
DECLINE.</p>
<p>Nations involved in political and religious decline are wont to lose the
moral foundation of the situation last described. Here, therefore, again,
both the repressive (which are almost always immoral) tendencies counter to
over-population, and the viciously preventive occupy the most prominent
place. <span class="pagenum">[Pg 319]</span> We may most completely observe
this spectacle among the heathen nations of later antiquity. But,
unfortunately, even among modern nations, we find some analogies to the
ancient, to which the political economist may point with the finger of
warning. "For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have
abundance; but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which
he hath." This universally applicable truth explains the fact that all
successive acts of immorality, the more frequently they occur the less
severely are they branded by public opinion.</p>
<p>A. We are not warranted, from the relative<a id="fnanchor_249-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_249-1">[249-1]</a>
number of illegitimate births, to draw too direct an inference in relation
to the morality of a people. Where, for instance, as in the kingdom of
Saxony, the annual frequency of marriage was 0.017 of the population, every
illegitimate birth bears evidence of a greater absence of self control than
in Bavaria, where, on every one thousand living, there were only thirteen
marriages a year.<a id="fnanchor_249-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_249-2">[249-2]</a> In many quarters, where
the economic relations are very stable, and where peasant estates
(<i>geschlossene Bauergüter</i>) are subject to a species of entailing,
where consequently the son can engage in marriage only after the death of
the father, illegitimate children are in great part legitimatized by
subsequent marriage at a later time, and meanwhile brought up in the family
of the mother like legitimate children.<a id="fnanchor_249-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_249-3">[249-3]</a> Evidently <span class="pagenum">[Pg 320]</span> the
guilty inconstancy creative of ephemeral <i>liaisons</i>, and the neglect
of the children born of them, do not here produce the sad effects which
they are wont to in the large cities, where illegitimate relations are made
and dissolved with shocking rapidity. However, births are seldom heard of
in the case of ruined debauchees.</p>
<p>At the same time, the frequency of illegitimate births is always an
evidence that the rightful founding of a home is made difficult<a id="fnanchor_249-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_249-4">[249-4]</a> by the economic condition of the police
provisions <span class="pagenum">[Pg 321]</span> of a country; and that the
moral force of the people does not suffice to resist the temptation<a id="fnanchor_249-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_249-5">[249-5]</a> which such condition and provisions suppose.
In the latter respect, this phenomenon may be considered, not only as a
symptom but also as a cause: since bastards are generally very badly
brought up. A large parthenic population is always an element of great
danger in a state.<a id="fnanchor_249-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_249-6">[249-6]</a> The frequency of
illegitimate children must, however, be designated as a tendency counter to
over-population, for the reason that still-born births and early deaths
occur much more frequently among them than among legitimate children.<a id="fnanchor_249-7"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_249-7">[249-7]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 322]</span>B. The trade of the women of the
town is indeed an exceedingly old one.<a id="fnanchor_249-8"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_249-8">[249-8]</a> But this evil assumes large dimensions only where a
large class of men and women have no prospect to marry at all, or only late

unaccustomed to keeping together for life.<a id="fnanchor_249-9"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_249-9">[249-9]</a> Prostitution may be considered a counterpoise

diseases which it propagates are not without importance in this regard. The

 The ratio between the number of illegitimate births and legitimate, so
 generally brought forward, leads to no correct conclusions whatever. The
 ratio between the number of illegitimate births, on the other hand, and
 marriageable men and women, especially of those who are yet unmarried, may
 afford a basis for valuable inferences. Compare <i>Hoffmann</i>, in the
 Preuss. Staatszeitung, 1837, No. 18. In Prussia, nearly 75 per cent. of
 all women between 17 and 75 are married. (<i>v. Viehbahn</i>, II,

 In Bavaria, not only was the frequency of marriage surprisingly small (one
 marriage a year in every 151.59 inhabitants, while the average in 14
 European countries was 1 in 123.9), but marriage was there contracted at a
 surprisingly advanced age. Of 10,000 of both sexes engaging in marriage,
 there were, in Bavaria, only 2,081 25 years of age and less, while in
 England, there were 5,528. Compare <i>Wappäus</i>, A. Bevölk. Statistik,

 In Oldenburg, it is estimated that 48 per cent. of its illegitimate

 Nassau even 70 per cent. (<i>Faucher's</i> Vierteljahrsschrift, 1864, II,

 cent. (<i>Hermann</i>, Bewegung der Bevolkerung, 20); in the Kingdom of
 Saxony, 1865, at least 21 per cent. (Statist. Zeitschr. 1868, 184.) In
 France 10 per cent. of the marriages contracted legitimatize children.
 (<i>Legoyt</i>, Stat. Comp., 501); in Saxony, 1865, 11.7; in Bavaria up to
 1852, about 1/8 of the marriages belonged to this category; 1858-61, 1/7;
 1861-64, nearly 1/6. Compare Heft XII, of the official statistics. In the
 manufacturing towns of France, especially the border ones, a large number
 of the children of female operatives and of males having their domicile in
 foreign parts, are legitimatized<a id="fnanchor_TN85"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN85">[TN

<p class="footnote">The number of illegitimate births stood to the
 aggregate number of births in 1800, as 1:16; in 1851, as 1:4.5; in
 1850-55, as 1:4.8; in 1856-59, as 1:5.04; in 1865, as 1:4.0; in 1866, as

 as 1:7.08, In 260 localities, in 1851, 1/3 and more of the aggregate
 number of births were illegitimate; in 209, ½ and more, and in 79 the
 entire number! The small improvement afterwards made was probably due in
 great part to emigration, which from 1850 to 1859 must have amounted to
 45,000. How relative the idea of over-population even in this respect is,
 is shown by the small number of illegitimate births in very densely
 populated parts of England—Lancashire, Middlesex, Warwick, Stafford,
 West York—while districts as thinly populated as North York, Salop,
 Cumberland, Westmoreland, have very many illegitimate births. The number
 increases in the best educated districts, where their "education" begins
 to cause them to make "prudent" and long delays in marrying.

 Strikingly more favorable influence of the <i>ecclesia pressa</i>. In
 Prussia, in 1855, the Evangelicals had 12.3 legitimate births for one
 illegitimate; the Catholics 19.4, the Jews 36.7, the Mennonites 211.5.

 The relative number of illegitimate births in many nations of to-day is
 unfortunately an increasing one. In France, in 1801, only 4.6 per cent. of
 all live births were illegitimate; in 1811, 6.09; in 1821, 7.07; in 1830,
 7.2; in 1857, 7.5; 1861-65, 7.56 per cent. The German especially must
 confess with deep shame that the southern half of the fatherland presents
 a very unfavorable picture in this respect. Can a nation be free when its
 capital, Vienna (1853-56), counts on an average 10,330 illegitimate and
 11,099 legitimate births? Compare <i>Stein-Wappäus</i>, Handbuch der
 Geogr., IV, 1, 193. According to observations made between 1850 and 1860,
 in England between 1845 and 1860, there were in Holland for every 1,000
 legitimate births 44 illegitimate, in Spain 59, in England and Wales 71,
 in France 80, in Belgium 86, in Prussia 91, in Norway 96, in Sweden 96, in
 Austria 98, in Hanover 114, in Saxony 182, in Bavaria 279. (Statist.
 Journ., 1868, 153.) Compare <i>Wappäus</i>, A. Bevölk. Stat., II, 387. In
 Russia, according to <i>v. Lengefeld</i>, 36.9; in the electorate of Mark,
 1724-31, 1 in 18. (<i>Süssmilch</i>, I, § 239.) During the 17th century it
 is estimated that the ratio of illegitimate to legitimate births in
 Merseburg was as 1:22-30, in Quedlinburg as 1:23-24, in Erfurt as 1:13½.
 (From the Kirchenbücher in <i>Tholuck's</i> Kircliches Leben, etc., I, 315
 seq.) In Berlin in 1640, only 1-2 per cent. of illegitimate births.
 (<i>König</i>, Berlin, I, 235.) In Leipzig, 1696-1700, 3 per cent.;
 1861-65, 20 per cent. <i>Knapp</i>, Mitth. des. Leipz. Statist. Bureaus,

 Thus, in 1811-20, the still-born births in Berlin, Breslau and Königsberg
 amounted to five per cent. of the legitimate, and to eight per cent. of
 the illegitimate; in the country places in Prussia, to 2¾ and 4¾ per cent.
 Of 384 illegitimate children born in Stettin in 1864, 45 were still-born
 and 279 died in their first year. (<i>v. Oettingen</i>, Moralstatistik,
 879.) In the whole monarchy, 1857-58, three to 4 per cent. of legitimate
 children died at birth, and 5 to 6 per cent. of the illegitimate; while
 during the first year of their age 18-19 per cent. of the former, and
 34-36 per cent. of the latter, died (<i>v. Viebahn</i>,<a id="fnanchor_TN86"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN86">[TN 86]</a> II, 235). In France, in 1841-54, of the legitimate
 births, an average of 4 per cent., and of illegitimate 7 per cent., was
 still-born; and the probability of death during the first year of life was
 2.12 times as great for an illegitimate child as for one born in lawful
 wedlock. (<i>Legoyt.</i>) After the first year the proportion changes.</p>

 culture than the contemporary Jews. In Athens, Solon seems to have
 established brothels to protect virtuous women. (<i>Athen.</i>, XIII, 59.)

 Travelers are wont to be the first to make use of prostitution. I need
 only mention the extremely licentious worship of Aphrodite (Aschera) which
 the Phoenicians spread on every side: in Cypria, Cytherae, Eryx, etc.
 Connected with this was the mercenary character of the Babylonian women
 (<i>Herodot.</i>, I, 199); similarly in Byblos (<i>Lucian</i>, De dea
 Syria, 6); Eryx (<i>Strabo</i>, VI, 272: <i>Diod.</i>, IV, 83), in Cypria;
 (<i>Herodot.</i>, I, 105, 199); Cytheria (<i>Pausan.</i>, I, 14); Athenian
 prostitutes in Piräeus and very early Ionian in Naucratis.
 (<i>Herodot.</i>, II, 135.) In all the oases on the grand highways of the
 caravans, the women have a very bad reputation. Temporary marriages of
 merchants in Yarkand, Augila, etc. (<i>Ritter</i>, Erdkunde, I, 999, 1011,
 1013, II, 360; VII, 472; XIII, 414.) It is remarkable how the legislation
 of German cities at the very beginning of their rise was directed against
 male bawds and prostitutes; at times with great severity, the death
 penalty being provided for against the former and exile against the
 latter, while the earlier legislation of the people was directed only
 against rape. (<i>Spittler</i>, Gesch. Hannovers, I, 57 ff.)</p>

 In Greece as well as in Rome, only slaves, freedmen and strangers sold
 their bodies for hire; but under the Emperors, prostitution ascended even
 into the higher classes. (<i>Tacit.</i>, Ann. II, 85; <i>Sueton.</i>,
 Tiber, 35; <i>Calig.</i>,41; <i>Martial</i>, IV, 81.) Concerning the
 Empress Messalina, see <i>Juvenal</i>, VI, 117 ff. Address of Heliogabalus

 time, even a man of such exalted position as M. Coelius was paid for
 cohabitation with Clodia, and even moved into her house. (<i>Drumann</i>,
 Gesch. Roms., II, 377.) Even in Socrates' time, the hetæras at Athens were
 probably better educated than wives: Compare <i>Xenophon</i>, Memorabilia,

 In keeping with the vicious counter tendencies described in this section,

<p class="center smaller">INFLUENCE OF THE PROFANATION OF MARRIAGE ON
POPULATION.</p>
<p>D. In the preceding paragraphs, we treated of the wild shoots of the
tree of population. But the roots of the tree are still more directly
attacked by all those influences which diminish the sacredness of the
marriage bond. It is obvious how heartless <i>marriages de
convenance</i>,<a id="fnanchor_250-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_250-1">[250-1]</a> inconsiderate divorces
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 326]</span> and frequent adulteries mutually
promote one another. And the period of Roman decline also is the classic
period of this evil. I need only cite the political speculation in which
Caesar gave his only daughter to the much older Pompey, or the case of
Octavia, who when pregnant was compelled to marry the libertine Antonius.<a id="fnanchor_250-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_250-2">[250-2]</a> Instead of the Lucretias and Virginias of
older and better times, we now find women of whom it was said: <i>non
consulum numero, sed maritorum annos suos computant</i>.<a id="fnanchor_250-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_250-3">[250-3]</a> In the numerous class of young people <span class="pagenum">[Pg 327]</span> who live without the prospect of any
married happiness of their own, we find a multitude of dangerous persons
who ruin the married happiness of others, especially where marriage has
been contracted between persons too widely separated by years.
<i>Corrumpere et corrumpi sæculum vocatur.</i> (<i>Tacitus</i>).<a id="fnanchor_250-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_250-4">[250-4]</a> It is easy to understand how all this must
have diminished the desire of men to marry. Even Metellus Macedonicus (131
before Christ) had declared marriage to be a necessary evil.<a id="fnanchor_250-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_250-5">[250-5]</a> <a id="fnanchor_250-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_250-6">[250-6]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 328]</span>In such ages young girls are kept
subject to a convent-like discipline, that their reputation may be
protected and that they may be able to get husbands; but once married they
are wont to be all the more lawless. In a pure moral atmosphere, precisely
the opposite course obtains.<a id="fnanchor_250-7"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_250-7">[250-7]</a></p>
<p>And so it has been frequently observed, that among declining nations the
social differences between the two sexes are first obliterated and
afterwards even the intellectual differences. The more masculine the women
become, the more effeminate become the men. It is no good symptom when
there are almost as many female writers and female rulers as there are
male. Such was the case, for instance, in the Hellenistic kingdoms, and in
the age of the Cæsars.<a id="fnanchor_250-8"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_250-8">[250-8]</a> What to-day <span class="pagenum">[Pg 329]</span> is called by many the emancipation of woman
would ultimately end in the dissolution of the family, and, if carried out,
render poor service to the majority of women. If man and woman were placed
entirely on the same level, and if in the competition between the two sexes
nothing but an actual superiority should decide, it is to be feared that
woman would soon be relegated to a condition as hard as that in which she
is found among all barbarous nations. It is precisely family life and
higher civilization that have emancipated woman. Those theorizers who, led
astray by the dark side of higher civilization, preach a community of
goods, generally contemplate in their simultaneous recommendation of the
emancipation of woman a more or less developed form of a community of
wives. The grounds of the two institutions are very similar. The use of
property and marriage is condemned because there is evidence of so much
abuse of both. Men despair of making the advantages that accompany them
accessible to all, and hence would refuse them to every one; they would
improve the world without asking men to make a sacrifice of their evil
desires. The result, also, would be about the same in both cases. (§ 81.)
So far would prostitution and illegitimacy be from disappearing that every
woman would be <span class="pagenum">[Pg 330]</span> a woman of the town
and every child a bastard. There would, indeed, be a frightful hinderance
under such circumstances to the increase of population. The whole world
would be, so to speak, one vast foundling asylum.<a id="fnanchor_250-9"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_250-9">[250-9]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 331]</span>But there is another sense to the
expression emancipation of woman. It should not be ignored that, in fully
peopled countries, there is urgent need of a certain reform in the social
condition of woman. The less the probability of marriage for a large part
of the young women of a country becomes, the more uncertain the refuge
which home with its slackened bonds offers them for old age, the more
readily should the legal or traditional barriers which exclude women from
so many callings to which they are naturally adapted be done away with.<a id="fnanchor_250-10"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_250-10">[250-10]</a> This is only a continuation of the course of
things which has led to the abolition of the old guardianship of the sex.
It may be unavoidable not to go much farther sometimes; but such a
necessity is a lamentable one.<a id="fnanchor_250-11">
</a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_250-11">[250-11]</a> The best

 This expression is applicable only in times of higher civilization where
 individual disposition of self is considered the most essential want.
 During the middle ages, when the family tie is yet so strong, the contract
 of marriage was generally formed by the family; but this was not, as a
 rule, felt a restraint. In France, at the present time, of 1,000 men who
 marry before their 20th year, 30.8 marry women from 35 to 50 years of age,
 and 4.8 who marry women over 50 years of age. (<i>Wappäus</i>, A.

<i>Propertius</i> bitterly complains of the corruption prevalent in love
 affairs in his time. (III, 12.) In the Hellenic world, also, among the
 successors of Alexander the Great, there was a revoltingly large number of
 <i>marriages de convenance</i>, so that even the old Seleucos took to wife

 Ptolemy etc. <i>Dante's</i> lament over the anxiety of fathers to whom

<i>Seneca</i>, de Benef., III, 16—a frightful chapter. Also, I, 9.
 <i>Juvenal</i> speaks of ladies who in five years had married eight men
 (IV, 229, seq.), and <i>Jerome</i> saw a woman buried by her 23d husband,
 who himself had had 21 wives, one after another, (ad. Ageruch, I, 908.)
 The first instance of a formal divorce <i>diffareatio</i> is said to have
 occurred in the year 523, after the building of the city (<i>Gellius</i>,
 IV, 3), a clear proof that the Romulian description of marriage, as
 κοινωνία ἁπάντων ἱερῶν καὶ χρημάτων<a id="fnanchor_TN93"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN93">[TN
 93]</a> (Dionys., A. R. II., 25), was long a true one. The old
 manus-marriage certainly supposes great confidence of the wife and her
 parents in the fidelity of the husband, while the marriage law of the time
 of the emperors relating to estates never lost sight of the possibility of
 divorce. The facility of obtaining amicable divorces (the most dangerous
 of all) appears from the gifts allowed, <i>divorti causa</i>, in L., 11,
 12, 13, 60, 61, 62; Dig., XXIV, 1. In Greece, we meet with the
 characteristic contrast, that, in earlier times, wives were bought, but
 that later, large dowries had to be insured to them or the risk of divorce
 at pleasure be assumed. (<i>Hermann</i>, Privataltherthümer, § 30.) How
 women themselves married again, even on the day of their divorce, see
 <i>Demosth.</i>, adv. Onet., 873; adv. Eubul., 1311. On Palestine, see
 Gospel of <i>John</i>, 4, 17 ff. Concerning present Egypt, where
 prostitution is carried on especially by cast-off wives, see
 <i>Wachenhusen</i>, vom ägypt, armen Mann, II, 139. During the great
 French revolution, divorces were so easily obtained that but little was
 wanted to make a community of wives. (Vierzig Bücher, IV, 205; Handbuch
 des französischen<a id="fnanchor_TN94"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN94">[TN 94]</a> Civilrechts, §
 450.) The more divorces there are in a Prussian province, the more
 illegitimate births also. Thus, for instance, Brandenburg, 1860-64, had
 1,721 divorces, and one illegitimate birth for every 7.8 legitimate
 (max.). Rhenish Prussia, four divorces and one illegitimate birth for
 every 25.4 legitimate (min.). In the cities of Saxony, it is estimated
 there are, for every 10,000 inhabitants, 36 divorced persons; in the
 country, only 19 (<i>Haushofer</i>, Statistik, 487 seq.); in Württemberg,
 20; Thuringia, 33; all Prussia, 19; Berlin, 83. (<i>Schwabe</i>,

 which, either actively or passively had not had some share in some odious
 scandal. Concerning even Cato, see <i>Plutarch</i>,<a id="fnanchor_TN95"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN95">[TN 95]</a> Cato, II, 25. Messalina's systematic patronage of

 In modern Italy, the monstrosity known as cicisbeism had not assumed any
 great proportions before the 17th century, in consequence of the bad
 custom which permitted no woman to appear in public without such
 attendant, and ridiculed the husband for accompanying his own. In the time
 of the republics, the conventual seclusion of girls and the duenna system
 were not yet customary. (<i>Sismondi</i>, Gesch. der Italiennischen
 Republiken, XVI, 251, ff., 498, ff.) Adultery punished with death in many
 cities of medieval Italy: for instance, the Jus Municipale Vicentinum,
 135. Concerning the Spanish cicisbeos, who evince as much shamelessness as
 fidelity, see <i>Townsend</i>, Journey, II, 142, ff. <i>Bourgoing</i>,

 A young American woman says to Mrs. Butler: "We enjoy ourselves before
 marriage, but in your country girls marry to obtain a greater degree of
 freedom, and indulge in the pleasures and dissipations of society." While
 the young girls are always to be met with in the streets, wives are to be
 found always in the kitchen. (<i>Mrs. Butler</i>, American Journal, II,
 183.) Compare <i>Beaumont</i>, Marie ou l'Esclavage aux États-Unis, I, 25
 ff. 349. The opposite extreme in Italy, where, therefore, too favorable an
 inference should not be drawn from the small number of illegitimate
 births. Morally considered, one act of adultery outweighs 10

 participate in the gymnasia, in the assemblies and to hold public office,

 qualities which fit for ruling. (De Rep., V, 451 ff.; De Legg., VI, 780;

 England of persons charged with serious crimes there were 10 women to 30
 men; in Russia only 10 women to 81 men. (<i>v. Oettingen</i>, 758.) As
 <i>Riehl</i> remarks, Famille 15, the undeniable <i>consensus gentium</i>,
 that the costume of men should differ from that of women, is an equally
 undeniable protest against this species of emancipation. I would add that,
 as among ourselves in the earliest years of childhood, so also among lowly
 civilized peoples, the difference in costumes of the sexes is least
 apparent. (<i>Tacit.</i>, Germ., 17; Plan. Carpin., Voyage en Tartarie;
 Add. éd., Bergeron, art. 2.) Even the physical difference is smaller there
 (<i>Waitz</i>, Anthropologie der Naturvölker, I, 76), especially in the
 size of the pelvis. (<i>Peschel</i>, Völkerkunde, 81, 86.)</p>

 children by parent and child, brother and sister. (<i>Diog. Laert.</i>,
 VII. 188.) In the time of Epictetus (Fr. 53, ed. Duebner), the Roman women
 liked to read Plato's republic, because in his community of wives they
 found an excuse for their own course. The Anabaptists appealed to Christ's
 saying that he who would not lose what he loved could not be his disciple.
 Thus the women should sacrifice their honor and suffer shame for Christ's
 sake. Publicans and prostitutes were fitter for heaven than honorable
 wives, etc. (<i>Hagen</i>, Deutschlands Verhältnisse im
 Reformationszeitalter, III, 221.)</p>
<p class="footnote">In our days, the theory inimical to the family is
 based rather on misconceived ideas of freedom and science. The Christian
 mortification of the flesh is, it is said, one-sidedness; and that the
 flesh no less than the spirit is of God. Hence it is that Saint Simonism
 would reconcile the two, and "emancipate" the flesh. (<i>Enfantin</i>,
 Economie politique, 2d ed., 1832.) <i>Fourier</i>, in his Harmonie, allows
 each woman to have one <i>époux</i> and two children by him; one
 <i>géniteur</i> and one child by him; one <i>favori</i> and as many
 <i>amants</i> with no legal rights as she wishes. His "harmonic" world he
 would protect against over-population by four organic measures: the
 <i>régime gastrosophique</i>, the object of which is by first-class food
 to oppose fecundity; <i>la vigeur des femmes</i>, because sickly women
 have most children; <i>l'exercise intégral</i>, since by the exercise of
 all the organs of the body the organs of generation are latest developed;
 lastly the <i>mœurs phanérogames</i>, the minuter description of which
 <i>Fourier's</i> disciples omitted in the later editions. (<i>N.
 Monde</i>, 377, ff.) <i>Fourier</i> was of opinion that only one-eighth of
 the mothers should be occupied with the bringing up of the children, and
 that a child's own parents were least adapted to bringing it up, as is
 proved by the natural aversion of the child to mind the advice or obey the
 injunctions of its own parents. (186 ff.) If all were left free to choose
 their employment, two-thirds of all men would devote themselves to the
 sciences, and one-third of all women; the fine arts would be cultivated by
 one-third of the men and two-thirds of the women. In agriculture,
 two-thirds of the men and one-third of the women would take to large
 farming, and to small farming one-third of the men and two-thirds of the
 women.</p>
<p class="footnote">The Communistic Journal, L'Humanitaire, is in favor of
 a community of wives proper, while <i>Cabet</i> leaves the question an
 open one. Compare, besides, <i>Godwin</i> on Political Justice, 1793,
 VIII, ch. 8. In beautiful contrast to this are <i>J. G. Fichte's</i>
 (compare, <i>supra</i>, § 2) views on marriage and the family in the
 appendix to his Naturrecht, although he, too, would largely facilitate

 business, in the making of ladies' dresses, shoes, etc. Compare <i>M.
 Wolstoncraft</i>, Rettung der Rechte des Weibes, translated by Salzmann,
 1793; <i>v. Hippel</i>, über die bürgerliche Verbesserung der Weiber,

 him. Compare <i>Josephine Butler</i>, Woman's Work and Woman's Culture: a

 19, siècle, 1873. Between 1867 and 1871, the number of men dependent on
 their own action in Berlin, increased 22.9 per cent.; of women dependent
 on their own labor, 36.6 per cent. (<i>Schwabe</i>, Volkszählung, 1871,

 independence of women, and expects from it especially a decrease in the

 dramatic art and the factory proletariat, where the independence in
 question obtains and indeed with very different results! It is very
 characteristic of the time, that <i>Homer</i>(Il., XII, 433) considered
 the spinning for wages as despicable, while <i>Socrates</i>, in the
 mournful period following the Peloponnesian war, earnestly counsels that
 free women without fortune should employ themselves with home industries.
 (<i>Xenoph.</i>, Memor., II, 7.) It is in keeping with this that during
 the time of scarcity after the Peloponnesian war even female citizens
 hired themselves out as nurses. (<i>Demosth.</i>, adv. Eubul., 1309,
 1313.) The frequency of such engagements has, in many respects, causes
 related to these which produce a frequency of illegitimate births.</p>

<p>China is, as a rule, considered the classic land of child-exposure. And
a writer of the country, who is considered one of the principal authorities
against the exposure of children, actually claims that it is reprehensible
only when one has property enough to support them. The murder of daughters
he especially reprobates as "a struggle against the harmony of nature; the
more a father performs this act, the more daughters are born to him; and no
one has ever heard that the birth of sons was promoted in this way."<a id="fnanchor_251-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_251-6">[251-6]</a> Moreover, the exposure of <span class="pagenum">[Pg 334]</span> children in the later periods of antiquity played

 According to <i>J. Bowring's</i> official report: Athenæum, 17 Nov., 1855.
 That the exposure of children is allowed by law in China, and that many
 poor couples marry with the intention of exposing them, is unquestionable.
 But the reports concerning the extent of the evil differ materially. The
 Jesuits estimated that in Pekin alone from 2,000 to 3,000 children were
 exposed in the streets. To this must be added the many thrown into the
 water or smothered in a bath-tub immediately after birth. Compare Lettres
 édif., XVI, 394 ff.; <i>Barrow</i>, 166 ff. The street-foundlings were
 picked up by the police and placed in wagons, living and dead together,
 and cast into one pit in a part of the city. Other accounts are much more
 favorable: thus that of <i>Ellis</i>, Voyage, ch. 7, who was there in
 1816, and of <i>Timkowski</i>, Reise, II, 359. Compare the quotations in

 It is an unfortunate fact that many modern nations approximate more
 closely to this abomination of the ancients than is generally supposed.
 The infrequency of illegitimate children in Romanic southern nations is
 offset by the enormous number of exposures almost after the manner of the
 Chinese. See the tables in <i>v. Oettingen</i>, Anhang, 95. In Milan,
 between 1780 and 1789, there were, in the aggregate, 9,954 children
 abandoned; between 1840 and 1849, 39,436. (<i>v. Oettingen</i>, 587.) On

 doctors there that they are ready to remove all impediments to
 menstruation "from whatever cause," see <i>v. Oettingen</i>, 523, and

 great Evils of Society, Pauperism, Prostitution and Celibacy, by a Doctor

 concerned only with one fundamental idea: to instruct women how to prevent
 conception!</p>

 the inhabitants, and even one-half of those at Dantzig. While previously
 the number of marriages annually was, on an average, 6,082, it rose in
 1711 to 12,028. In 1712 it was 6,267, and sank some years afterwards on

 (<i>Messance</i>, Recherches sur la Population, 766.) In Russia, too, it

 (<i>Gibbon</i>, Hist. of the Roman Empire, ch. 10.) It also made frightful
 ravages, intellectually, on the nationality of the Romans.
 (<i>Niebuhr.</i>) Thus, in England, the black death contributed very
 largely to cause the disappearance of the medieval spirit.
 (<i>Rogers.</i>) Of great political importance was the pestilence of
 Bagdad, which, in 1831, carried off 2/3 of the inhabitants. All national
 bonds seemed dissolved, robbers ruled the country; the army of the
 powerful Doud Pascha was carried off entirely, and his whole political

 The decreasing number of English Quakers, among whom, in 1680-89, there
 occurred 2,598 marriages, and in 1840-49 only 659, finds expression in the
 unfrequency of marriage, a comparatively small number of women and a small
 number of children, all in conjunction with a small mortality. (Statist.
 Journ., 1859, 208 ff.) There is no reason to have recourse here to vice as
 a cause, and scarcely to physiological reasons for an explanation, because
 these phenomena are accounted for in great part by the fact that adult

 In this respect, however, there is a great difference between bondage and
 slavery. As early a writer as <i>Polybius</i> speaks of the depopulation
 of Greece. (<i>Polyb.</i>, II, 55; XXXVII, 4.) He looks for the cause in
 this, that in every family, for luxury's sake, either no children whatever
 were wanted, or at most from one to two, that the latter might be left
 rich. (Exc. Vat., 448.) Very remarkable, <i>Seneca</i>, Cons. ad. Marc,
 19. Further, <i>Cicero</i>, ad. Div., II, 5. <i>Strabo</i>, VII, 501;
 VIII, 595; IX, 617, 629. <i>Pausan.</i>, VII, 18; VIII, 7; X, 4; <i>Dio
 Chr.</i>, VII, 34, 121; XXXIII, 25. <i>Plutarch</i> claimed that Hellas
 could, in his time, number scarcely 3,000 hoplites, while in the time of
 Themistocles, Megalis alone had put as many in the field. (De Defectu
 Orac., S.) Antium and Tarentum similarly declined under Nero.
 (<i>Tacit</i>., Ann., XIV, 27.) The depopulation even of the capital,
 which began under Tiberius, is apparent from <i>Tacit.</i>, Ann., IV, 4,
 27. National beauty also declined with the nation's populousness.
 <i>Æschines</i> saw a great many beautiful youths in Athens (adv.
 Timarch., 31); <i>Cotta</i>, only very few (<i>Cicero</i>, de Nat. Deorum,
 I, 28); <i>Dio Chrysostomus</i>, almost none at all (Orat., XXI). On the
 necessary lowering of the military standard of measure, see <i>Theod.</i>,
 Cod., VII, 13, 3, <i>Verget</i>, de Re milit., I, 5. The depopulation of
 the later <i>orbis terrarum</i> is confirmed by the easiness of the new
 division of land with the German conquerors. Compare <i>Gaupp</i>, Die

old too precisely because of its age: and the force of inertia would always
turn the scales in favor of the latter. This inertia, both physical and
mental is so general, that perhaps the majority of mankind would continue
forever satisfied with their traditional field of occupation and with their
traditional circle of food, were it not that an impulse as powerful and
universal as the sexual and that of the love of children compelled them to
extend the limits of both. That man might subdue the whole earth it was
necessary that the Creator should make the tendency of man to multiply his
kind more powerful than the original production-tendency of his earliest<a id="fnanchor_TN103"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN103">[TN 103]</a> home. The unknown far-away deters as much as
it attracts.<a id="fnanchor_253-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_253-3">[253-3]</a> It is easy to see how the
division and <span class="pagenum">[Pg 339]</span> combination of labor
become uniformly easier as population increases in density. Think only of
large cities as compared with the country.<a id="fnanchor_253-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_253-4">[253-4]</a> "Under-populated"<a id="fnanchor_253-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_253-5">[253-5]</a> countries, which <span class="pagenum">[Pg
340]</span> might easily support a large number of human beings, and which,
notwithstanding have for a long period of time had only few inhabitants,
are on this account abodes of poverty, regions where education and progress
are unknown. While, therefore, it cannot be questioned that a nation under
otherwise equal circumstances is more powerful and flourishing in
proportion as its population embraces a large number of vigorous,
well-to-do, educated and happy human beings, the last mentioned attributes
should not be left out of consideration.</p>
<p>The possibility of over-population is contested by a great many
theorizers (§ 243); and, indeed, the complaints on this score are in most
cases only a baseless pretext of the inertia which feels the pressure of
the population without being helped and spurred thereby to an increase of
the means of subsistence. This inertia itself, especially when it governs a
whole nation, is a fact which cannot be ignored. Over-population, as I use
the term, exists whenever the disproportion between the population and the
means of subsistence operates in such away that the average portion of the
latter which falls to the share of each is oppressively small, whether the
effect produced thereby manifests<a id="fnanchor_TN104"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN104">[TN
104]</a> itself in a surprisingly large mortality, or in the limitation of
marriages and of the procreation of children carried to the point of
hardship. Over-population of this kind is, as a rule, curable by extending
the limits of the field of food, either as a result of the advance of
civilization at home, or by emigration.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 341]</span>That the whole earth should be
incurably over-peopled is an exceedingly remote contingency.<a id="fnanchor_253-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_253-6">[253-6]</a> But where, within a smaller circle, by reason
of the great stupidity or weakness of mankind, or by the too great power of
circumstances, over-population cannot act as a spur to new activity, it is
indeed one of the most serious and most dangerous political diseases.<a id="fnanchor_253-7"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_253-7">[253-7]</a> The immoderate competition of workmen involves
the majority of the nation in misery, not only materially but also morally;
one of the most dangerous temptations, for the rich to a contempt for human
kind, for the poor to envy, dishonesty and prostitution. In every
suffocating crowd, the animal part of man is wont to obtain the victory
over the intellectual. Precisely the simplest, most universal and most
necessary relations are most radically and disastrously affected by the
difficulty or impossibility of contracting marriage, and the sore
solicitude for the future of one's children.<a id="fnanchor_253-8"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_253-8">[253-8]</a></p>

 A map of Europe, which would show the density of population by the
 intensity of shade, would be darkest in the vicinity of the lines between
 Sicily and Scotland, between Paris and Saxony, and grow lighter in
 proportion to the distance from their point of intersection. Italy is the
 country with the earliest highly developed national economy of modern
 times, and England that which possesses the most highly cultivated
 national economy; as the Rhine is, from the standpoint of civilization,
 the most important river in Europe. It is remarkable, in this connection,
 how slowly population increased in all European countries during the 18th
 century, and how rapidly after the beginning of the 19th, and especially
 since 1825. According to <i>Dieterici</i> (Berliner Akademie,<a id="fnanchor_TN105"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN105">[TN 105]</a> 16 Mai, 1850), the population increased
 annually per geographical square mile:</p>

 happily shows how seldom those who can live comfortably without it are
 extraordinarily active. The Malthusian law prevents this ever becoming the
 condition of the majority. Precisely during those years that man is most
 capable of labor, there is a prospect of a great increase of outlay, in
 case one does not remain single, which would inevitably degrade every one,
 a few over-rich excepted, who had not taken care to provide for a
 corresponding increase of income. Were it not for this, human progress
 would become slower and slower, for the reason that the <i>dura

<p class="footnote">(<i>Rau</i>, Lehrbuch, III, § 280.) In many European
 countries, the population has for a long period of time, and in a
 comfortable way, increased most rapidly where it has been densest. Thus,
 for instance, the kingdom of Saxony was, in 1837, the most densely
 populated of all the monarchical states of Germany (6,076 inhabitants per
 square mile), Hanover (2,416) and Mecklenburg-Schwerin (2,004) were among
 the most sparsely peopled. And yet the annual increase of population
 between 1837 and 1858 was greatest in Saxony (1.36 per cent.) while
 Hanover (0.44) and Mecklenburg-Schwerin (0.59) stood very low in this
 respect. In very thinly populated countries, nature permits even the
 civilized man to deteriorate: thus the French in Canada, the Spaniard in
 the valley of the La Plata.</p>

 This excellent expression seems to have been first used by
 <i>Gerstner</i>, Grundlehren der Staatsverwaltung, 1864, II, 1, 176 ff. It
 must indeed be distinguished from a rapidly growing, but for the time
 being, a sparsely settled country. A nation with an equal population on a
 larger surface is, frequently in the immediate present weaker than another
 in which the population is more dense; but it has the advantage of a
 greater possibility of growth in the future. Think of the electorates of
 Saxe and of Brandenburg in the sixteenth century. Just as <i>Thaer</i>,
 Landwirthschaftliche Gewerbelehre, § 149, advises that a mere annuitant
 should, values being the same, rather purchase a smaller fertile estate; a
 very able husbandman the reverse.</p>

 We need only call to mind such facts as for instance that the United
 States wealth of coal is 22 times as great as that of Great Britain.
 (<i>Rogers</i>, The Coal Formation and a Description of the Coal Fields of
 North America and Great Britain, 1858.) In addition to this, only about 16
 per cent. of the combustible material is really used in the way furnaces
 are now generally filled, only 10 per cent. in foundry furnaces, and from
 14 to 15 per cent. in the transportation of passengers on railways. The
 Falls of Niagara afford a water-power equal to 2/3 of all the steam
 engines which existed, a short time since, in the whole world. (<i>E.
 Hermann</i>, Principien der Wirthschaft, 1873, p. 49, 153, 243.) But that
 single families, houses, branches of business, etc. may be over-peopled,
 and the impoverishing disproportion between numbers and the means of
 subsistence not be susceptible of immediate removal by the unaided power
 of the crowded circle, cannot be questioned.</p>

 between relative and absolute over-population: the former is remediable by
 intellectual and especially by political development, while the latter
 borders on the extreme physical and possible limits of the means of
 subsistence. <i>W. Thornton</i>, Over-population and its Remedy, 1849, 9,
 considers a country in English circumstances over-populated when a man
 between twenty and seventy years of age is not in a condition to support,
 by means of his wages, 1¼ persons in need of assistance (children under
 10, women over 60, and men over 70 years of age).</p>

<p>Hence it was not an erroneous policy that most governments have sought
to promote the increase of population in undeveloped nations. So far as the
influence of the acts of government can reach, such a course must tend to
the earlier maturity of a people's economy. Much more questionable are
positive provisions by government intended to hinder the further increase
of population in a country already supposed to be fully peopled; if for no
other reason, because even the deepest, most varied and extensive knowledge
can scarcely ever predict with certainty that no further extension of the
field of food is possible under the spur of momentary over-population; and
also because questions of population reach so far into the life and
tenderest feelings of the individual that a government which has regard for
the personal freedom of its subjects, instead of promoting or hindering
marriage, emigration etc. by police regulations, cannot but limit itself to
a statistical knowledge and legislative regulation of these relations.<a id="fnanchor_254-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_254-1">[254-1]</a><a id="fnanchor_254-2">

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 343]</span>Whether the population of a country
increase in a well-to-do or proletarian manner; whether, therefore, the
state should rejoice or lament over such increase, may generally be
inferred <span class="pagenum">[Pg 344]</span> with some certainty from the
other conditions of the country's economy, especially from the height of
the rate of wages and from the consumption of the nation (§ 230). Thus, for
instance, <span class="pagenum">[Pg 345]</span> the population of England,
between 1815 and 1847, increased 47 per cent.; but during the same period
the value of its exports increased 63 per cent.; the tonnage of its
merchant marine, 55 per cent.; the amount yielded by the tax on legacies,
and therefore moveable property, by 93 per cent.; the value of immoveable
property by 78 per cent. Wherever in agriculture the ancient system of
triennial rotation (<i>Dreifelder-system</i> = <i>three-field system</i>)
has been exchanged for the so-called English system, not only is a greater
number of men supported, but, as a rule, each is more abundantly provided
for.<a id="fnanchor_254-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_254-3">[254-3]</a> The construction of new
houses is an especially good symptom, because a habitation is a want which
governs many others, and which, at the same time, may be much curtailed
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 346]</span> in case of need. Only, there should
be no thoughtless building speculations, the existence or absence of which
may readily be inferred from the ratio between the rent of houses and the
rate of interest usual in the country. In England and Wales there was, in
1801, one house to every 5.7 inhabitants; in 1821, to every 5.8; in 1841,
to every 5.4; in 1861, to every 5.39; in 1871, to every 5.35.<a id="fnanchor_254-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_254-4">[254-4]</a></p>

 There may be observed a regular ebb and flow in the opinions of theorizers
 on this subject. During the latter, great enthusiasm is manifested over
 the increase of population, which is considered an unqualified benefit;
 later, over-population gives rise to uneasiness. Not many had as much
 insight as Henry IV.: <i>la force et la richesse des rois consistent dans
 le nombre et dans l'opulence des sujets</i>. (Edict., in <i>Wolowski</i>
 in the Mémoires de l'Acad. des Sciences morales et politiques, 1855.)
 Thus, for instance, <i>Luther</i>, in his sermons on the married state,
 advises all young men to marry at 20, and all young women at from 15 to 18
 years of age. The person who fails to marry because he cannot support a
 family has no real confidence in God. God will not allow those who obey
 his command to want the necessaries of life. Werke by <i>Irmischer</i>,
 XX, 77 ff. In England, great dread of depopulation under the first two
 Tudors: 4 Henry VII., c. 19; 3 Henry VIII., c. 8. <i>J. Bodinus</i>, De
 Rep., VI, is charmed with the Lex Julia et Papia Poppæa. Its repeal was
 immediately followed by the greatest looseness of morals and by
 depopulation.</p>
<p class="footnote">On the other hand, a great dread of over-population
 prevailed among English political economists at the end of the sixteenth
 and the beginning of the seventeenth century. They recommended their
 colonial projects by saying that they desired to avert this danger. Thus,
 for instance, <i>Raleigh</i>, History of the World, I, ch. 4;
 <i>Bacon</i>, Sermones fid., 15, 33, and his essay, De Colonies in
 Hiberniam deducendis. Compare <i>Roscher</i>, Zur Geschichte der
 englischen Volkswirthschaftslehre, 24, 26, 31, 34, 42. Similarly, at the
 end of the fifteenth century, in highly developed Italy, which had become
 stationary. According to <i>F. Patricius</i> (De Inst. Republ., VI, 4;
 VII, 12): <i>incolarum multitudo periculosa est in omni populo</i>. Since
 <i>Colbert's</i> time, the opposite opinion has become the prevailing one.
 The densest population had been observed in the wealthiest and relatively
 the most powerful countries, and people thought they had here sufficient
 data for a wide generalization. The thought of military conscription by
 degrees obtained weight in this connection. Thus, <i>Saavedra Faxardo</i>,
 Idea Principis christiano-politici (1649), Symb. 66; <i>De la Court</i>,
 Aanwysing (1699), I, 9. <i>Sir W. Temple</i>, says that the fundamental
 cause of all commerce and wealth lies in a dense population, which compels
 men to the practice of industry and frugality. (Works, I, 162 ff., 171,
 III, 2.) <i>Imperii potentia ex civium numero astimanda est.</i>
 (<i>Spinoza</i>, Tract, politicus, VII, 18.)</p>
<p class="footnote">Thus <i>Petty</i> says that 1,000 acres which can
 support 1,000 men are better than 10,000 which do the same thing. He would
 give Scotland and Ireland up entirely, and have the inhabitants settle in
 England. In this way all combination for common purposes would be
 facilitated. (Several Essays, 107 seq., 147 ff.) Peter the Great is said
 to have entertained a similar view: Œuvres de Frédéric le Grand, II, 23.
 More moderate is <i>Child</i>, Discourse of Trade, 298, and still more so
 in 368 ff.; <i>Locke</i>, Works, I, 73 ff.; II, 3, 6, 191. In Germany,
 <i>v. Seckendorff</i> advises that great establishments for children
 should be erected, in which orphans and even the children of poor parents
 should be brought up at the expense of the state, simply with the object
 of increasing the number of healthy men. (Teutscher Fürstenstaat, ed.
 1678, 203, Add. 179.) <i>Becher</i>, Polit. Discours, 21, would have
 murderers punished because they detract from population, although he
 elsewhere in his definition of a city, "a nourishing populous community,"
 is no blind enthusiast over-population. According to <i>v. Horneck</i>;
 Oesterreich über Alles, 1684, 29 ff., the third fundamental rule of public
 economy is the greatest possible increase and employment of men. <i>Vera
 regni potestas in hominem numero consistit; ubi enim sunt homines, ibi
 substantiæ et vires.</i> (<i>Leibnitz</i>, ed., Dutens, IV, 2, 502.)
 According to <i>Vauban</i>, Dîme royale, 150, Daire, no child can be born
 of a subject by which the king is not a gainer. Compare 46,145. Numbers of
 People the greatest riches. (<i>Law</i>, Trade and Money, 209.) Similarly,
 Law's disciple <i>Mélon</i>, Essai politique sur le Commerce, ch. I, 3.
 The number of people is both means and motive to industry
 (<i>Berkeley</i>, Works, II, 187) and hence the public are interested in
 nothing so much as in the production of competent citizens. (Querist, Nr.,
 206.) <i>Süssmilch</i>, Göttl. Ordnung, I, Kap. 10; Œuvres de Frédéric M.
 IV, 4; VI, 82.</p>
<p class="footnote">About the middle of the 18th century, we find a whole
 school of political thinkers who decide every question from the standpoint
 of the influence of the solution on the increase of population.
 (Excellently refuted by <i>Schlözer,</i> Anfangsgründe, II, 15 ff.) Thus
 especially <i>Tucker</i>, Important Questions, IV, 11; V, 5; VII, 4; VIII,
 5. Four Tracts, 70. <i>Forbonnais</i>, Finances de France, I, 351, who
 considered it one of the principal objects of a good industrial policy to
 employ the greatest possible number of men. <i>Necker</i>, Sur le Commerce
 et la Législation des Grains, 1776. <i>v. Sonnenfels</i>, Grundsätze der
 Polizei, Handlung und Finanz (1765), in which the principle of population
 is called the highest principle of all four sciences of the state (I, § 25
 ff.). These writers understand the "balance of trade" in such a way, that
 a nation always operates most advantageously which gives employment to the
 largest number of men with its export articles, (<i>v. Sonnenfels</i>, II,
 § 210 ff., 354 ff.) <i>v. Justi</i>, Staatswissenschaft, I, 160 ff., says
 plainly that a country can never have too many men. According to
 <i>Darjes</i>, Erste Gründe, 379, "even the increase of beggars brings
 something into the treasury by means of the excise tax which they pay."
 Compare, also, <i>J. J. Rousseau</i>, Contrat Social, III, 9;
 <i>Galiani</i>, Della Moneta, II, 4; <i>Verri</i>, Opuscoli, 325;

 Philosophy, III, ch. 11. On similar grounds, <i>A. Young</i> laments that
 the increase of proletarians is greatly hindered by the English poor laws.
 (In later writings it is somewhat different: compare Travels in France, I,
 ch. 12.) How deeply such ideas had penetrated public opinion is apparent
 from the opening words of the Vicar of Wakefield, as well as from the
 declaration of <i>Pitt</i> in parliament in 1796, that a man who had
 enriched his country with a number of children had a claim upon its
 assistance to educate them. Much more correctly, <i>Voltaire</i>, Dict.

 Of certain modern economists, it may be said that they deplore and condemn
 the birth of every child for whose support there has not been established
 a life long annuity in advance. A remarkable but unsuccessful attempt is
 made by <i>Ch. Périn</i>, De la Richesse dans les Sociétés Chrêtiennes, at
 the end of the first volume, to reconcile the opposing views. Périn
 reproaches the Malthusians, and especially <i>Dunoyer</i> and <i>J. S.
 Mill</i>, with the advocacy of <i>l'onanisme conjugal</i>, and thus
 desiring to restore the old heathen situation. Only the Church holds the
 proper mean between defect and excess, inasmuch as it permits complete
 continency or the procreation of children regardless of circumstances to
 its members; while, on the other hand, it, by celibacy and by the
 inculcation of industry, frugality, etc., guards against over-population.
 (How well the Roman Church has succeeded in this is best proved by the
 Roman Compagna!)</p>
<p class="footnote">In Greece, too, in its first economic periods,
 especially at the time that the first colonies were sent out, great fears
 were expressed of over-population. <i>Hesiod</i> weighs the advantages and
 disadvantages of the married state against one another with great
 thoroughness. (Theog., 600 ff.) In the Cypria, even the Trojan war was
 explained by a divine decree, emitted with the intention of removing
 over-population.</p>

 for the well-being of the masses, <i>J. J. Neumann</i> recommends the
 relative number attending higher schools, also that of shoemakers,
 tailors, etc., because the magnitude of the consumption of wool, leather,
 etc., can scarcely be directly ascertained. (<i>Hildebrand's</i> Jahrbb.,

 Statist. Journ., 1861, 251. In Liverpool, between 1831 and 1841, the
 population increased 40 per cent., and the number of houses 24 per cent.,
 on account of the large immigration of Irish proletarians. (Edinb. Rev.
 LXXX, 80.) According to <i>Fregier</i>, les Classes dangereuses, the
 number of good buildings continually increased under Louis Philippe,<a id="fnanchor_TN108"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN108">[TN 108]</a> and that of the worst lodging houses
 continually diminished. In Prussia, between 1819 and 1858, the population
 increased 60.8 per cent., the number of houses, 30.1 per cent.; but the
 insurance-value of the houses seems to have increased in a still greater
 proportion, (<i>v. Viebahn</i>, Zollverein's Statist., II, 291, ff., 299.)
 According to <i>Horn</i>, Bevölk. Studien, I, 62, ff., there are to every
 100 persons in France, 20 dwelling houses; in Belgium, 19; in Great
 Britain, 18; in Holland, 16; in Austria, 14; in Prussia, 12. Too much
 should not be inferred from this mere table, as, for instance, in English
 cities, a house is, on an average, smaller than in the Prussian. A French
 house has, on an average, only 5½ windows and doors; a Belgian house, on
 the other hand, 3½ rooms. And so, in villages, it is found that there are
 uniformly fewer persons to a house than in cities, especially large ones.
 In Belgium, for instance, the cities have to every 100 inhabitants, 66
 rooms, the country only 62. In the largest parishes of France (over 5,000
 inhabitants), the number of doors and windows is on the average almost six
 times as great as in the smallest (under 5,000 inhabitants); but only 4
 times as many persons live in them. (<i>Horn</i>, loc. cit. I, 76 ff.)</p>

<p class="center smaller">MEANS OF PROMOTING POPULATION.</p>
<p>The following are the principal means which have been used to
artificially promote the increase of population:</p>
<p>A. Making marriage and the procreation of children obligatory by direct
command. Among almost all medieval nations so strong is the family feeling,
that it seems to men to be a sacred duty to keep their family from becoming
extinct. Where a person is not in a condition physically to fulfill this
duty, the law supplies a means of accomplishing it by juridical
substitution<a id="fnanchor_255-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_255-1">[255-1]</a> at least. Most national
religions<a id="fnanchor_255-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_255-2">[255-2]</a> operate in the same
direction, as well as the influence of political law-givers, who fully
share in the contempt for willful old bachelors and sterile women, which
runs through the national feeling of all medieval times.<a id="fnanchor_255-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_255-3">[255-3]</a> In addition to this, there are the positive <span class="pagenum">[Pg 348]</span> rewards offered for large families of
children.<a id="fnanchor_255-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_255-4">[255-4]</a> Even Colbert, in 1666,
decreed that whoever married before his 20th year should be exempt from
taxation until his 25th; that anyone who had 10 legitimate children living,
not priests, should be exempt from taxation for all time;<a id="fnanchor_255-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_255-5">[255-5]</a> that a nobleman having 10 children living
should receive a pension of 1,000 livres, and one having 12, 2,000 livres.
Persons not belonging to the nobility were to receive one-half of this, and
to be released from all municipal burthens.<a id="fnanchor_255-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_255-6">[255-6]
</a> Such premiums are, indeed, entirely superfluous. No nobleman would
desire 12 children simply to obtain a pension of 2,000 livres! Colbert
himself abandoned this system of premiums shortly before his death.<a id="fnanchor_255-7"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_255-7">[255-7]</a> <a id="fnanchor_255-8">
</a> <a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_255-8">[255-8]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 349]</span>In the case of morally degenerated
nations, in which an aversion to the married state had gained ground,
efforts have sometimes been made to work against it by means of new
premiums. Thus, especially in Rome, since the times of Cæsar and Augustus,
although with poor success. It little becomes one who is himself a great
adulterer to preach the sixth commandment.<a id="fnanchor_255-9"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_255-9">[255-9]

 the rewards of prolificacy, see <i>Valer. Max.</i>, II, 9, 1; <i>Livy</i>,

 cities made marriage a qualification for the holding of certain public
 offices, etc. In some places, the public treasury was made the heir of
 bachelors, a custom not abolished in Hanover until 1732. Compare
 <i>Ludewig</i>, on the Hagestolziatu (1727), but also <i>Selchow</i>,
 Elem. Juris Germ., § 290. On the fines imposed on old bachelors in Spain,

 Frederick the Great limited the mourning time of widowers to 3 months and
 of widows to 9. His abolition of ecclesiastical punishment for those who
 had fallen, and his prohibition of censuring them under penalty of fine,
 was based as much on his population policy as on philanthropic grounds.
 (Preuss. Geschichte, Friedrich's M., II, 337.) Similarly in Sweden:
 <i>Schlözer</i>, V. W., V, 43. In Iceland, after a great plague, even in
 the last century, it was provided that it should be no disgrace to a young
 woman to have as many as six illegitimate children. (<i>Zacchariä</i>,
 Vierzig Bücher vom Staate, II, 112.) The marshal of Saxony wished, in the
 interest of the recruiting of the army, that marriages should be
 contracted only for a term of five years. (Rêveries de Maurice, etc.,
 345.) The sterile women of Egypt visit the Tantah, a place of pilgrimage

 Even in the year 131 B. C., the censor Metellus demanded that citizens
 should, for political reasons be compelled to marry. (<i>Livy</i>, LIX,

 Max.</i>, II, 9, I.) Cæsar distributed land by way of preference among
 those who had three or more children. (<i>Sueton.</i>, Cæs. 20.) Augustus'
 celebrated Lex Julia et Papia Poppæa sought to urge even widows to marry
 again in opposition to the moral public conscience. (Partly augendo
 ærario: <i>Tacit.</i>, Ann., III, 25.) <i>Dio Cass.</i>, LVI, 1 ff. Trajan
 did more yet, inasmuch as he gave great assistance to impoverished
 parents, even of the highest classes, to enable them to educate their
 children. <i>Sub te liberos tollere libet, expedit!</i> (<i>Plin.</i>,
 Paneg., 26.) Of what little assistance all this really was,
 <i>Tacitus</i>, Ann., III, 25, IV, 16, and <i>Plin.</i>, Epist. IV, 15,
 bear witness. If, under the Cæsars, the damage done to the childless in
 the case of inheritance was a frequent motive of divorce
 (<i>Friedländer</i>, Sittengeschichte I, 389), the L. Julia, in fact,
 operated in a direction contrary to that in which it was intended to
 work.</p>

<p class="center smaller">IMMIGRATION.</p>
<p>B. Calling for immigrants. This is a means all the more in favor,
inasmuch as it provides the country not only with new-born children, but
with mature men, who frequently, when they come from thickly peopled and
highly civilized <span class="pagenum">[Pg 350]</span> countries, promote
the industries of the country of their adoption, and become the teachers of
a higher civilization. I need only mention the inhabitants of the Low
Countries, who in the twelfth century settled as agriculturists in Northern
Germany,<a id="fnanchor_256-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_256-1">[256-1]</a> and in the fourteenth
and sixteenth centuries in England, as artisans; the German miners and
inhabitants of cities, who, during the middle ages, colonized Hungary,
Transylvania<a id="fnanchor_256-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_256-2">[256-2]</a> and Poland,<a id="fnanchor_256-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_256-3">[256-3]</a> and the French Huguenots, who fled to the
Independent Protestant countries. Nearly all the remarkable Russian princes
since Ivan III. have endeavored in this way to induce Germans to settle in
Russia, and, for the same reason, Peter the Great refused to give up his
Swedish prisoners of war.<a id="fnanchor_256-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_256-4">[256-4]</a> The great Prussian rulers have cultivated the policy
of immigration on an extensive scale, and thus maintained the original
character of their parent provinces as the colonial land of the German
people.<a id="fnanchor_256-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_256-5">[256-5]</a> <a id="fnanchor_256-6"></a> <a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_256-6">[256-6]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 351]</span>Such immigrants have been generally
accorded a release from taxation and from military duty for a number of
years; a proper measure since the state thereby only surrendered an
advantage temporarily which it otherwise would not have possessed at all.
Where the land of the state receiving the immigrants was still almost
valueless, it has frequently been made over in parcels to well-to-do
colonists without consideration.<a id="fnanchor_256-7"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_256-7">[256-7]</a> Assistance exceeding these limits is a very
questionable boon. It should not be forgotten that the influx of men who
bring no capital whatever with them, and who are not good workmen, is of no
advantage. Nor are they always the best elements of a people who emigrate.
They are very frequently men who, through their own fault, did not prosper
at home, and who come to the new country, with all their old faults.<a id="fnanchor_256-8"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_256-8">[256-8]</a> This is, of course not true of those who
emigrate <span class="pagenum">[Pg 352]</span> from their attachment to
some great principle; for instance, it is not true of those who emigrate in
search of freedom of conscience. These may become, provided they are in
harmony with their new environment, a support and ornament to their adopted
country.<a id="fnanchor_256-9"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_256-9">[256-9]</a> But there is always
danger that they may not be able to adapt themselves to their new economic
relations, and that thus they may in consequence succumb to the pressure of
circumstances.<a id="fnanchor_256-10"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_256-10">[256-10]</a></p>
<p>Oriental despotisms have frequently endeavored to assure themselves the
possession of newly conquered countries by <span class="pagenum">[Pg

distant part of their old empire. Thus, the Jews were carried into Assyria
and Babylon; the Eretrians into Persia; the inhabitants of Caffa by
Mohammed II.; the Armenians by Abbas the Great. The Russians, too,
undertook a similar transportation of people under the Ivans.<a id="fnanchor_256-11"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_256-11">[256-11]</a></p>
<p>C. The prohibition of emigration, which, in the case of serfs, vassals
and state-villeins, it seems natural enough, was very usual in periods of
absolute monarchical power. Thus, for instance, Frederick William I.
forbade the emigration of Prussian peasants under penalty of death. Whoever
captured an emigrant received a reward of two hundred thalers.<a id="fnanchor_256-12"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_256-12">[256-12]</a> The public opinion of modern times is very
decidedly opposed to this compulsion, which would make the state a
prison.<a id="fnanchor_256-13"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_256-13">[256-13]</a> "A really excessive
population would still find an exit to <span class="pagenum">[Pg
354]</span> escape, namely, through the gates of death." (<i>J. B.
Say.</i>) The statesman, on the other hand, who opposes the withdrawal of
political or ecclesiastical malcontents should take care, lest he act like
the physician who prevents the discharge of diseased matter from the sick
body, and causes it to take its seat in some vital organ.<a id="fnanchor_256-14"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_256-14">[256-14]</a> Hence, even where emigration is considered
detrimental to the country, no governmental condition should be attached to
it, except that the person desiring to emigrate should give timely notice
of his intention, and receive his passport only after it has been shown
that he has discharged all his military duties, paid his taxes and his
debts.<a id="fnanchor_256-15"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_256-15">[256-15]</a> <a id="fnanchor_256-16"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_256-16">[256-16]</a></p>

 In Poland, a multitude of German colonists established themselves during
 the thirteenth century on the domains of the crown and of the church. As a
 rule, they obtained the land in consideration of moderate services and
 rents, which, however, did not begin to run until after eight years, nor
 until after thirty for uncleared land. In addition to this, they were
 governed by the German law, and their communal authorities were for the
 most part German. (<i>Roepell</i>, Gesch. von Polen, I, 572 ff.)</p>

 establishing colonists. Up to 1728, 20,000 new families were received into
 Prussia alone. <i>Stenzel</i>, Preuss. Gesch. III, 412 ff. Frederick the
 Great endeavored above all to retain in the country the strangers who came
 there periodically. Thus, the harvesters of Vogtland, in the neighborhood
 of Magdeburg, and the Vogtland masons in the suburbs of the capital
 (1752). Compare <i>v. Lamotte</i> Abhandlungen, 1793, 160 ff. He is said
 to have settled 42,600 families, mostly foreigners, in 539 villas and
 hamlets. Besides, the population of Prussia, between 1823 and 1840,
 increased by 751,749 immigrants, without any positive favors shown them
 (<i>Hoffmann</i>, Kleine Schriften, 5 ff.), and the greater part of these
 were not very poor.</p>

 In Russia, the Emperor Alexander, in 1803, promised the colonists a full
 release from taxation during ten years, a reduction of taxation for ten
 more, and freedom from civil and military service for all time; besides 60
 <i>dessatines</i> of land per family gratis, an advance of 300 rubles for
 housebuilding, etc. and money to enable them to maintain themselves until
 their first harvest. The provision relating to Poland (1833) was much less
 favorable: importation of movable property free of duty, freedom from
 military duty and from taxation for six years, and perpetual quit rents
 (<i>Erbzinsgüter</i>) to agriculturists who owned a certain amount of
 capital. Brazil promised immigrants, in 1820, land and ten years' freedom
 from taxation. Compare <i>Jahn</i>, Beiträge, z. Einwanderung und
 Kolonisation in Br. (1874), 37 ff. Hungary, in 1723, accorded settlers
 freedom from taxation for six years and artisans for fifteen years.

 Many of Frederick the Great's colonists turned out very badly. They were
 attracted only by the premiums offered, and they became dissolute after
 they had consumed them. Many of them thought that they were to be of use
 only by giving children to the state (<i>Meissner</i>, Leben des Herrn v.
 Brenkenhof, 1782), and that the land donated them was to be cultivated by
 others at the expense of the state! <i>Dohm</i> mentions villages of
 colonists which had to a great extent changed hands four times in 20
 years. Whether the king would not have better attained his object had he
 employed the younger sons of Prussian peasants as colonists, <i>quære</i>.
 (<i>Dohm</i>, Denkwürdigkeiten, IV, 390 ff.) Even <i>Süssmilch</i> says:
 "A native subject is, in most cases and for most purposes, better than two
 colonists." (Göttl. Ordnung, I, 14, 275.) Compare the work: Wie dem
 Bauernstande Freiheit und Eigenthum verschafft werden könne, 1769, 16.
 Every family of colonists in South and new East Prussia is said to have
 cost the state 1,500 thalers. (<i>Weber</i>, Lehrbuch der polit. Oekonomie,
 1806, II, 172); but according to <i>Büsching</i> (Beiträge z.
 Regierungsgeschichte Friedrichs,<a id="fnanchor_TN109"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN109">[TN
 109]</a> II, 239), only 400 thalers. <i>J. Möser</i> is strongly opposed
 to the encouragement of immigration by direct appeals to it. (P. Ph., I,
 60.) According to <i>Bülau</i>, Staatswirthschaftslehre, 24, only those
 immigrants are welcome who are attracted to the country by the whole
 character of its national institutions and circumstances. It is a
 different matter when, for instance, the government in New South Wales
 permits the colonists, by the payment of very moderate contributions, to
 have their workmen, friends and relations come after them from England in
 ships owned by the government. Between 1832 and 1858, £1,700,000 were paid
 out for such transportation. (Novara-Reise, III, 53.)</p>

<p>D. Hygienic measures and the improvement of the sanitary police of a
country are of the utmost importance, not only to increase the number of
inhabitants, but also to produce the conditions of population described in

<p>E. It is the indispensable condition precedent of all the measures which
we have examined, if they would attain their end, that the means of
subsistence of the people should be increased or at least more equally
divided among them. Where this has been done the increase of population
will, as a rule, take care of itself; where it has not, the artificially
increased procreation of children can only produce new victims for the
angel of death. A merely more equable distribution can, however, improve
the condition of the people only in exceedingly rare cases. (§ 204). As a
rule, the diseases which it is attempted to thus cure grow worse, or they
at least increase in extent. (§ 80, ff., 250.) It is quite different, of
course, when the more equable distribution coincides with an absolute
growth of the nation's economy. We shall see, later, that, for instance,
the freedom of land alienation and of industrial pursuits, when not
accompanied by an important advance in the corresponding branches of
economy may do more harm than good; but that under favorable circumstances
a multitude of dormant forces are thereby awakened, and that then the
national-economical dividend may be increased much more than the divisor.

<p class="center smaller">MEANS OF LIMITING THE INCREASE OF POPULATION.</p>
<p>A. The means which consists in rendering marriage less easy by
legislation is surrounded with peculiar difficulties in densely populated
countries, which are always highly civilized. The state would have here to
swim against the stream, and it would be generally a much less difficult
task to enlarge the field of food. If there remained from a former period
any inducements held out to promote marriage, it is self evident that they
should now be discontinued. A voluntary bachelor must now no longer be
considered as a man who permits one more woman to become an old maid, but
as one who facilitates marriage to another couple.<a id="fnanchor_258-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_258-1">[258-1]</a> On the other hand, it should not be forgotten that,
for men, generally, marriage is not only an occasion of increased outlay,
but also an incentive to increased activity and greater economy.<a id="fnanchor_258-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_258-2">[258-2]</a> Many states have endeavored to condition the
founding of a family by requiring evidence that the father has a prospect
of being able to support one.<a id="fnanchor_258-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_258-3">[258-3]</a> <span class="pagenum">[Pg 357]</span> Distinguished theorizers accede to this
condition, inasmuch as they deny the right of over-population.<a id="fnanchor_258-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_258-4">[258-4]</a> But, unfortunately, it is impossible, except
in a few extreme cases, to assert or deny a prospect of being able to
support a family.<a id="fnanchor_258-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_258-5">[258-5]</a> How easily is the most
remunerative power of labor destroyed by physical or mental disease.
Scarcely less subject to change is the so-called certain opportunity of
acquisition afforded by a profession or a trade, when it is not guarantied
by the possession of considerable capital or of landed property, or by some
legal privilege. The amount of property required by many laws is so small
that it alone would suffice to support the family only for a few years.<a id="fnanchor_258-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_258-6">[258-6]</a> And yet it has been generally <span class="pagenum">[Pg 358]</span> provided that the proof of such a property
gave one an unconditional right to establish a domicile and to marry. It is
only where this is wanting that special consent is required. But who shall
exercise this right of consent? The parish, perhaps, because on it the
impoverished family would fall as a burthen. But it is to be feared that
the course of procedure here would be too severe. Local narrow-heartedness
might refuse the right of domicile to skillful and industrious candidates,
who are in the best situation to maintain a family, but whose competition
the older members of the parish might dread.<a id="fnanchor_258-7"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_258-7">[258-7]</a> Hence, in most countries, the parish is treated as a
party, on whose protest against the marriage the state itself <span class="pagenum">[Pg 359]</span> decides<a id="fnanchor_258-8"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_258-8">[258-8]</a> If the state authorities were to give the immediate
decisions in such cases, we might expect, in ordinary times, a liberality
which would frustrate the object of the law; but sometimes, also,
considerable chicanery on grounds of so-called higher police.</p>
<p>Where there still exist classes and corporations with real independence,
the members of which still attach a real value to the body, the matter
takes care of itself. The journeyman, for instance, voluntarily retards his
marriage until he has become a master workman, and once he has attained
that degree, he "works the golden mine of his trade."<a id="fnanchor_258-9"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_258-9">[258-9]</a> But wherever a numerous proletariat exists,
the individuals of which have no better future to expect, whatever their
present sacrifices and self-denial, and who know nothing of class-wants or
class-honor, prohibitions of marriage are severely felt, and are far from
being well enforced.<a id="fnanchor_258-10"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_258-10">[258-10]</a> The rule which
excites least opposition is the fixing of a normal age for marriage, under
which males should not be allowed to undertake its engagements.<a id="fnanchor_258-11"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_258-11">[258-11]</a> Of all privileges those attaching to age are
viewed <span class="pagenum">[Pg 360]</span> with least aversion. Something
similar is effected in most countries to-day by military conscription,
which, on this account, in young countries, has a very restrictive effect
on the increase of population.<a id="fnanchor_258-12"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_258-12">[258-12]</a> The best means against thoughtless marriages
certainly consists in increasing the measure of individual wants (§ 163);
assuming, of course, that the added wants are proper and worthy.<a id="fnanchor_258-13"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_258-13">[258-13]</a> There is always the consideration that all
limitation of marriage, even voluntary self-limitation, by decreasing or
postponing marriage, may prove disastrous to morals. It should, however,
not be forgotten that there are other sins besides impurity, and that
complete poverty constitutes one of the worst of temptations. Especially is
it not the angel guardian of chastity.<a id="fnanchor_258-14"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_258-14">[258-14]</a></p>
<p>In England<a id="fnanchor_258-15"></a> <a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_258-15">[258-15]</a> and France, all
governmental hinderances to marriage have long since ceased, and in
Prussia, at least all general police hinderances; and we can by no means
say that the consequences have been evil. On the other hand, no favorable
results as to their influence on pauperism can be shown statistically from
the restrictive laws of Württemberg. Rather do statistics point here to the
unfavorable probable <span class="pagenum">[Pg 361]</span> result of an
increase of illegitimate births.<a id="fnanchor_258-16"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_258-16">[258-16]</a> According to the law of the North German
Confederation of 1868, the contract of marriage, except in the case of
soldiers, officials, clergymen and teachers, is so free, so far as police
influence is concerned, that even actual poverty is no impediment.<a id="fnanchor_258-17"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_258-17">[258-17]</a> <a id="fnanchor_258-18"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_258-18">[258-18]</a> <a id="fnanchor_258-19"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_258-19">[258-19]</a></p>

 In Ireland, the unsalaried condition of the Catholic clergy who depended
 entirely on marriage fees (as high as £20 being paid by poor farmers.

 unfavorable conditions. See § 254.</p>

 It is very noteworthy in this connection that married people commit
 relatively fewer crimes than single persons. Thus, for instance, in
 Prussia, in 1861, of every 1,000 unmarried men over 16 years of age, 1.18
 were sent to the house of correction; of every 1,000 married men, only
 0.59; of every 1,000 divorced, 13.71! (Preuss. Statist. Zeitschr., 1864,
 318 seq.) In Austria, 1858-59, there was one person under sentence in
 every 203 unmarried persons, in every 669 married, and in every 1,053
 widows and widowers. Of the married, there was a larger proportion of
 criminals among the childless than among those with children (49.8 per
 cent. against 42.6 per cent.). Compare <i>v. Oettingen</i>,
 Moralstatistik, 759. This evidence is all the stronger since,
 circumstances being otherwise the same, fathers of families are harder
 pressed by cares for food than single persons.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_258-3"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_258-3" class="pginternal">[258-3]</a>
 In Würtemberg, the authorities were for the first time enjoined in 1633,
 to dissuade people from untimely marriages; in 1712 the consent of the
 authorities to a marriage was made dependent on the evidence of a
 religious education and the capacity to support a family. Between 1807 and
 1828, all restrictions on marriage because of incapacity to support a
 family were removed. According to the Bavarian Penal Code of 1751 (I, 11,
 § 7), persons who had married without governmental authorization, and who
 could not afterwards support themselves except by begging, were sentenced
 to at least one year in the workhouse and to be whipped once a week. Only
 a short time ago scarcely any one in Bavaria had a real and unquestionable
 right to marry. (<i>Braun</i>, Zwangscölibat für Mittellose in
 <i>Faucher's</i> Vierteljahrsschrift, 1867, IV, 8.) Austrian law relating
 to the proof of the certainty of maintaining one's self by one's trade
 etc: 12 Jan., 1815; 4 Sept., 1825.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_258-4"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_258-4" class="pginternal">[258-4]</a>
<i>R. Mohl</i>, in the 3d edition of his Polizeiwissenschaft, I, 152 ff.,
 requires proof of the possession of a sufficiency of food, at least of the
 means to begin house-keeping. According to <i>Marlo</i>, Weltökonomie,
 III, 84 ff., and <i>Schäffle</i>, Kapitalismus und Socialismus, 689 ff.,
 the compulsory insurance of widow and children should precede
 marriage.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_258-5"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_258-5" class="pginternal">[258-5]</a>
 Thus the Württemberg law of 1833 prohibits the marriage of those who are
 under prosecution on account of repeated thefts, fraud, or carrying on the
 trade of a beggar; also all such as have been criminally punished within
 the two next preceding years, and all who within the three next preceding
 years have received alms from the public treasury, except in cases of
 misfortune, of the causes of which they were innocent. The Bavarian law of
 April 16, 1868, gives the parish a right of veto. According to the royal
 Saxon ordinance of 1840, male recipients of alms are permitted to marry
 only when their marriage makes an important amelioration of their
 circumstances probable, and does away with the necessity of public
 assistance in the future.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_258-6"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_258-6" class="pginternal">[258-6]</a>
 During Iceland's middle age, prohibition of marriage for all who did not
 possess at least from 100 ounces of silver or 600 ells <i>vadhmal</i>.
 (<i>K. Maurer</i>, Island, 443 seq.) In Bavaria (July 1, 1831), the right
 of domicile is made to depend on a landownership free of debt, and a
 <i>steuersimplum</i> of from 1 to 2 florins (in towns more) in country
 parishes; on the real (reales) right of carrying on a trade, or on a
 personal trade-concession sufficient for support. A tax of 1 florin in
 1852 meant about 1,200 florins worth of property. In other cases it
 depended on whether the parish recognized the existence "complete and
 permanent of the means of livelihood." Here good repute and the possession
 of a considerable savings bank deposit were to be particularly considered.
 In cases of competition, discharged soldiers who had served out their
 term, and good servants of 15 years service were to be preferred. In
 Württemberg (1833) a sufficient guaranty that a person contemplating
 marriage possessed the means of support was: the personal capacity to
 exercise a liberal art or to follow a scientific career, to engage in
 commerce or agriculture, or some branch of industry, or follow a trade,
 with sufficient income therefrom to support a family; or the possession of
 a property, according to locality, of 1,000, 800 or 600 florins. The law
 of May 5, 1852, was more exacting, and required, besides personal
 competency, evidence that one's calling yielded a sufficient income, as
 well as of an amount of property free of debt, of the value of from 150 to
 200 florins. In Baden (1831) a property considered sufficient to insure
 the means of livelihood amounted in the four largest cities to 1,000
 florins, in 10 smaller ones to 600; in the remaining communities to 300
 florins. In the electorate of Hesse, the amount (1834) was from 150
 thalers (for small country communities) to 1,000 thalers. (Kassel.) An
 irreproachable character is required by many laws (in Württemburg, since
 1832, the good reputation of both parties), and the community is empowered
 to dispense with the other material conditions. Long-continued
 savings-bank deposit speaks well for the parties' competency to support a
 family, because it bears testimony to an excellent economic
 disposition.</p>

 Those callings in which a certain <i>esprit de corps</i> prevails such as
 that, for instance, of officials and officers, submit willingly to
 restrictions on marriage authoritatively imposed. The Catholic clergy
 submit even to a full prohibition of marriage. Such measures uniformly
 strengthen the isolation of the class from the nation as a whole. It is
 well known that, during the middle ages, theological views on the
 meritoriousness of all self-denial made voluntary celibacy very common.
 The Franciscan order counted at one time 150,000 monks and 28,000 nuns,

<i>Malthus</i>, Principle of Population, IV, ch. 4, 5. It is a great error
 to suppose that the number of immoral acts increases and decreases with
 the frequency of temptation. In Ireland, farmers very frequently keep
 their men servants and maid servants even after the latter have married.
 But the very facility with which a fall is legalized, increases very
 largely the number of reckless marriages. (<i>Meidinger</i>, Reise, II,
 187 seq.) In the country about Göttingen also, where the people marry much
 earlier on an average than in that about Calenberg, illegitimate births
 are much more frequent.</p>

 See the tables in the Tübinger Zeitschrift, 1868, 624 ff. Thus, formerly,
 in Rhenish Bavaria, where there was complete liberty allowed in this
 matter, the poor rates compared with the population, were only 34.6 per
 cent. of the average in the rest of Bavaria; and the number of
 illegitimate births was not so unfavorable by one-half. (<i>Rivet</i>, in
 the Archiv der polit. Oekonomie, N. F., I, 39.) The Bavarian law of the
 16th of April, 1868, which provides that the community or parish can
 object to a person's marriage only on account of unpaid parish taxes or
 poor rates (art. 36) largely increased the number of marriages and
 diminished the illegitimate births; in the first year to 22.2 per cent.,
 in the second to 17, and in 1873 to 13.2 per cent. (Allg. luth
 Kirchenztg., 12 März, 1875.) According to official statement, this law did
 more to improve the condition of workmen in the towns than any other
 cause. Compare <i>Thudichum</i>, Ueber unzulässige Beschränkungen des
 Rechts der Verehelichung, 1868. Per contra, <i>E. Schübler</i>, Ueber

 The obstacles formerly placed in many countries in the way of the marriage
 of Jews of allowing only the first-born to marry, and this only when a
 vacancy occurred in the number of families by death (Austria), was not
 based on a solicitude about population, but on religio-national
 intolerance, in part also on commercial police grounds.</p>

<p class="center smaller">EFFECTS OF EMIGRATION.</p>
<p>B. It is sufficiently evident that emigration from an over-populated
country<a id="fnanchor_259-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_259-1">[259-1]</a> may be attended with good
consequences, especially when it takes place in organized bodies.<a id="fnanchor_259-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_259-2">[259-2]</a> There is little danger that one who knows how
to work and pray will go to the bad in a young agricultural colony. In a
wilderness which has not yet been cleared, the greater number of
proletarian vices spontaneously disappear. There is here no opportunity for
jealousy or theft; little for intemperance, the gaming table,
licentiousness or quarrelsomeness. Here labor is a necessity, and the
rewards of industry and saving soon take a palpable shape. As the emigrant,
in such a situation, can scarcely help marrying, children far from being a
burthen, soon become companions to their parents in their solitude and,
later, helpmates in business. The colonist belonging to the lower middle
class is most certain of improving his condition. It may, indeed, require
many and toilsome years before he can feel comfortable himself; but his
children who would probably have led a proletarian life in the mother
country may calculate with certainty on future well-being. The father's
small capital which the outlay for education alone would have exhausted at
home, here becomes the seed of a number of prosperous households.<a id="fnanchor_259-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_259-3">[259-3]</a> It is otherwise with the mass of the <span class="pagenum">[Pg 363]</span> people who remain at home. (Compare §
241.)<a id="fnanchor_259-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_259-4">[259-4]</a> It is a matter of much more
difficulty than is generally supposed by those who have not made a study of
the matter, that the yearly emigration from countries like Germany should
counterbalance the excess of births over deaths.<a id="fnanchor_259-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_259-5">[259-5]</a> It is not to <span class="pagenum">[Pg 364]</span>
be supposed that men who are really useless at home should be of any
service in the colonies. How violently have not <span class="pagenum">[Pg
365]</span> English colonies opposed the advent of settlers from the
poorhouses of the mother country. The classes which are readiest to
emigrate: idlers, fickle characters, fathers of families with altogether
too many children, artisans who by a revolution in industry have lost the
means of making a livelihood, are precisely those who find it most
difficult to obtain employment on the other side of the water.<a id="fnanchor_259-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_259-6">[259-6]</a> Most colonies refuse to receive persons over
forty years of age at their own expense. But a young man intellectually and
physically able to work, can always make his way even in the old world;
only the weaker <span class="pagenum">[Pg 366]</span> succumb under the
pressure of over-population. Lastly, it should be considered what an amount
of capital is required for purposes of emigration and settlement. If
emigrants, on the average, take more capital with them than is estimated to
be the <i>per capita</i> amount of capital possessed by those remaining at
home,<a id="fnanchor_259-7"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_259-7">[259-7]</a> the consequence would be
that, as a result of this very successful emigration, the ratio of
consumers to the amount of capital in the country would become more and
more unfavorable. The emigrating portion of the country might experience
the advantage of this, but the great mass of the population remaining at
home would become poorer in capital and in vigorous men,<a id="fnanchor_259-8"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_259-8">[259-8]</a> and richer in the comparatively <span class="pagenum">[Pg 367]</span> needy. The comfortless contrast between
colossal wealth and beggarly want could only be thereby increased, since it
is almost exclusively the lower middle class who emigrate to agricultural
colonies. The over-rich, as a rule, will not, and proletarians can not, go
thither.<a id="fnanchor_259-9"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_259-9">[259-9]</a> <a id="fnanchor_259-10"></a> <a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_259-10">[259-10]</a></p>

 According to parliamentary investigations, the Irish laborer in Australia,
 Canada, etc., improves in a few years to such an extent that he can
 scarcely be distinguished from the Anglo-Saxon. He becomes industrious,
 self-reliant etc. (Edinb. Rev., 1950, 25.) In North America, however, the
 Irish seldom become really well off, or occupy a position of consequence
 in society. (<i>Görtz</i>, Reise, 88.)</p>

<a href="#fnanchor_259-4" class="pginternal">[259-4]</a>
<i>E. G. Wakefield</i>, in other respects so intelligent a writer on the
 theory of colonization, is of opinion that every nation might, by giving a
 proper direction to emigration, establish such a density of population as
 it desired. Thus, for instance, if there were 10,000 marriages contracted
 every year in a country, and it was provided that each of these 10,000
 couples should be sent to some colony immediately after marriage, the
 whole mother country would become extinct in from 60 to 70 years. This
 extreme is of course not desired by any one; but the way to be followed in
 order to attain a desirable limit is hereby pointed out. That emigration
 has in so few instances checked the advance of population, Wakefield
 accounts for by the fact that the means furnished to emigration have to a
 certain extent been wasted, and that old men, children, etc., who either
 had no influence on population as yet, or could have no more in future,
 constituted a large proportion of those who left the country. (England and
 America.)</p>
<p class="footnote">Evidently an important consideration is here omitted,
 viz.: that there is no such a thing as a normal year of marriages, etc.
 If, for instance, all males were to wait until their 30th year, and all
 females until their 20th, to enter the married state, and that the
 government were to send all competent persons as soon as they had reached
 this age to America, what would be the consequence? Numberless situations
 affording the means of supporting a family would be vacant, and a number
 of young men of 29 and of young women of 19 would be induced to marry,
 etc. The number of children to a marriage in England in 1838-44 was 4.13;
 1845-49, 3.96; 1850-54, 3.26; 1855-59, 4.15. (Journal des. Econ., Oct.,

<i>Benjamin Franklin</i>, in 1751, estimated the aggregate number of
 English inhabitants in the North American colonies at 1,000,000, of whom
 only 80,000 had immigrated into the country. Hence, from 1790 to 1840, the
 United States, the promised land of European emigrants, received only
 about 1,500,000 emigrants. From 1820 to 1859, the number (according to
 <i>Bromwell</i> and <i>Hübner</i>) was 4,509,612; according to a report of
 the New York Chamber of Commerce (1874), 9,054,132 since 1824. An annual
 immigration of 100,000 was reached for the first time in 1842. According
 to the census of 1870, there were in the United States 5,567,229 persons
 born in foreign countries, of which number 1,690,410 were born in Germany,
 1,855,827 in Ireland, and 5,550,904 in England. The aggregate emigration
 from the British empire, which unquestionably possesses most colonies and
 the largest marine, was, on an average, between 1825 and 1835, only about
 55,000; 1836 to 1845, over 80,000; in 1845 alone, over 93,000, while the
 yearly excess of births over deaths between 1841 and 1848, according to
 <i>Porter</i>, was in England and Wales alone, on an average, 169,000.
 During the succeeding years emigration received an extraordinary stimulus
 (which changed the proportion) in the influence of the discovery of the
 Californian and Australian mines, and in the Irish famine. Hence the
 emigration was, at least,</p>

<p class="footnote">while the natural increase of population in Prussia
 alone (1843-55) amounted to almost 150,000 per annum; in the kingdom of
 Saxony (1834-49), to over 18,000; in Austro-Germany and the five German
 kingdoms together, 305,000. (<i>Wappäus</i>, Bevölkerungsstatistik, I,
 133.) In New York alone, in 1852, 118,600 Germans arrived; in 1853,
 119,500; in 1854, over 178,000. That, at present, emigration is, on the
 whole, so much more frequent than formerly, is accounted for by the
 largely improved means of communication. However, it was estimated a
 century ago, that Europe sent at least 100,000 persons per annum to the
 East and West Indies. Between 1700 and 1719, an aggregate of 105,972
 persons emigrated to the Dutch East Indies; between 1747 and 1766,
 162,598. (<i>Saalfeld</i>, Gesch. des Holländ. Ostindiens, II, 189.) It
 should not be ignored, however, that the readiness to forsake the
 fatherland, which only a short time ago was so usual in Germany (in
 England, it prevails chiefly among the Irish), justified the greatest
 solicitude for the roots of German national life. How little Germany
 really suffers from over-population, is shown especially by the
 circumstance that, for instance, in Prussia, it is precisely the most
 densely populated districts to which immigration is largest. Compare <i>v.
 Viebahn</i>, Zollverein. Statist, II, 242.</p>

 While the most active demand for labor, for instance, existed in Australia
 generally, three government ships carrying emigrants arrived: one with
 English agricultural laborers, the second with former factory hands, the
 third with Irish. The agricultural laborers found places very rapidly a
 few days after their arrival; the factory hands did only tolerably well,
 while of the poor Irish not one-half could find anything to do, and became
 a burthen on the benevolence of the public. (<i>Merivale</i>, Lectures on

 It is estimated that the first 21,200 settlers of New England brought
 about $1,000,000 with them. (<i>Bancroft</i>, Hist. of the United States.)
 The 50,000 emigrants who came to Quebec in 1832 were estimated to be worth
 $3,000,000. It is thought that German emigrants to America, bring with
 them, on an average, 280 thalers, to which must be added 40 thalers
 passage money. This seems very high, while German estimates are generally
 too low, because no emigrant has any interest to overestimate his
 property, but frequently to underestimate it. Thus, for instance, in
 1848-49, 8,780 persons emigrated from Prussia with 1,713,370 thalers of
 property, i. e., 195 thalers each. (Amtl. Tabellen, f., 1849, I, 290.) It
 is said that between 1844 and 1851, 45,300 persons emigrated from Bavaria
 with governmental consent, and that they carried with them property to the
 amount of 19,233,000 florins; that is, 424 florins each. (Beiträge zur
 Statistik des Kgr. Bayern, III, 322 seq.) Here the average amount of means
 carried away by emigrants seems to decrease; a sign that the mass of those
 emigrating come from successively lower strata of the population.

<p class="footnote">A still smaller amount of capital would suffice for
 the purpose of emigration itself. Persons who settled in Canada (1823)
 cost the English nation £22 per capita, which amount provided them with
 cows, seeds, agricultural implements, help in building, and food for
 twelve months. According to the Edinburg Rev., Dec., 1826, only £15, 4s.
 were necessary for the same purpose. If it be borne in mind that many of
 these settlers afterwards caused five times as many relatives to come over
 at their own expense, the necessary outlay per capita would seem very
 small indeed; frequently not more than one year's maintenance in the
 poorhouse would have cost. Almost £1,000,000 are sent every year from the
 United States through banks and emigration bureaus, by emigrants, to the
 United Kingdom, to bring over their relatives. (Statist. Journal, 1872,

<i>J. S. Mill</i>, indeed, thinks that even where there is a larger
 emigration of capital than of men, the combined pressure which both exert
 on the natural forces of the country emigrated from must become less.
 (Principles, IV, ch. 5, 1.) Compare <i>Hermann</i>, loc. cit. 28 ff.
 <i>Hermann</i> also shows very clearly how emigrants to America would
 frequently like to return; but the expense of returning deters them from
 the undertaking, and they manage to get along by great effort, which,
 however, would have afforded them a livelihood if they had remained at
 home. Staatsw. Unters. II, Aufl. 480.</p>

 much less frequently in large numbers. Thus, between 1853 and 1858, 3,694
 males emigrated from Saxony and only 2,609 females. Between 1866 and 1874,
 there were 1,754,231 male immigrants to the United States, and only
 1,147,446 females. According to <i>Rümelin</i> (Allg. Ztg., December,
 1865), the large emigration from Württemberg produced by the years of
 scarcity—1850 ff.—left such a preponderance of women that 1/6
 of all the young women who have reached a marriageable age at present,
 would remain unmarried, even if all the marriageable young men were to
 engage in matrimony. Thus negative emigration does very little to cure the
 social disease of involuntary celibacy.</p>

<p class="center smaller">COLONIST EMIGRATION.</p>
<p>All these dangers disappear when the portion of the nation which has
emigrated continues economically connected with the body of the nation
remaining at home. (Colonizing emigration.) Here emigration not only
provides "elbow room" in the mother country, but there arises at the same
time an increased demand for manufactured articles, an increased supply of
raw material, by means of which an absolute growth <span class="pagenum">[Pg 368]</span> of population is made possible.<a id="fnanchor_260-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_260-1">[260-1]</a> England has hitherto enjoyed these advantages
to the fullest extent, Germany scarcely at all. German emigrants to Russia,
America, Australia, or Algiers, were, together with all they have and are,
for the most part lost to their fatherland. They become the customers and
suppliers of foreign countries, and frequently enough the competitors and
even enemies of Germany.<a id="fnanchor_260-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_260-2">[260-2]</a> <a id="fnanchor_260-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_260-3">[260-3]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 369]</span>It might be very different if the
stream of German emigration was directed towards German colonies for
instance, as happened in later medieval times, towards the fertile but
thinly populated parts of Hungary, towards the provinces of Austria and
Prussia; perhaps, as List wished, towards those parts of Turkey which, God
willing, shall yet constitute the inheritance of the German people. Thus,
through the instrumentality of emigration, might a new Germany arise, which
would directly or indirectly and necessarily ally itself to the old,
politically, and at the same time constitute the surest bulwark against the
danger from Slavic power.</p>
<p>Politico-economically, this country might be utilized by Germany as the
United States uses the Mississippi valley and the Far West, especially as
concerns the exclusiveness of the use. It is true, that emigrants could be
invited to these quarters in good conscience only when the soil had been
prepared for them. They should find there, on their arrival, complete legal
security, especially for the landed property to be acquired by them;
likewise, at least, full personal, religious, and also commercial
freedom.<a id="fnanchor_260-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_260-4">[260-4]</a></p>
<p>It may be asked, whether there are places in the other quarters of the
world adapted to German colonization in the higher sense of the word. These
should of course be countries adapted to agriculture as practiced by the
Germans,<a id="fnanchor_260-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_260-5">[260-5]</a> with an easily
accessible coast and provided in the interior with navigable streams. Here
the Germans should be able not only to live together in large numbers, but
the rest of the population should be inferior to them in political training
and in national feeling. Otherwise, there would in time be <span class="pagenum">[Pg 370]</span> danger of their losing the German character
and feeling.<a id="fnanchor_260-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_260-6">[260-6]</a> The difficulty of
establishing German colonies in the southern temperate parts of Chili and
Brazil would be aggravated by the very same causes which prevented the
creation of a German navy for centuries; and they would almost certainly
have to calculate on the jealousy of all other colonial powers and of the
United States.<a id="fnanchor_260-7"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_260-7">[260-7]</a> We should not forget
that from Raleigh's time to the present, almost every speculation having
for its object the founding of a colony, whether originating with
individual capitalists or with joint-stock companies, has been, considered
from a mercantile point of view, a failure. The fruits of new colonization
are generally reaped in the succeeding generation; and such delay is
scarcely in harmony with the ideas of our own times. Almost every
settlement has had its critical period when the settlers almost despaired.
This produced less harm in the 17th century; for they were for the most
part compelled to persevere. In our day, they would probably disband and go
in search of an easier life in colonies already existing. And yet, Germany
must make haste if it would not soon see the last appropriate locality
occupied by other and more resolute nations.<a id="fnanchor_260-8"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_260-8">[260-8]</a> <a id="fnanchor_260-9"></a>

 There has hitherto been little to rejoice over in the condition of German
 emigrants. The greater number of them had received so little education
 that they were by no means in a way to oppose the weapons of attack of
 Anglo-Americans. The glorious literature of their old home scarcely
 existed for them. Almost the only national peculiarity which they held to
 with any tenacity was the disposition to a want of union among themselves.
 Hence they were necessarily de-Germanized in a few generations, after a
 toilsome and quarrelsome period of transition. How seldom, even in Ohio,
 did German names occur in the list of public officials, while in New York
 the number of German names on the poor list is very considerable. The
 situation, however, seems to have improved in modern times, and the
 national coherency and political power of the mother country have gone
 hand in hand with the revival of attachment on the part of the emigrants
 to the land of their nativity. How beautifully was this attachment
 manifested during the Franco-Prussian war in 1870-71!</p>

<p class="center smaller">STATE AID TO EMIGRANTS.</p>
<p>The inquiry, What can the state reasonably do for emigration, must, of
course, receive a very different answer according as there is question of
merely negative (§ 259) or colonizing emigration (§ 262). To give the
latter a proper impulse requires so great an outlay of capital and labor
that it can be made only by the state; and in Germany, on a large scale,
only by a union of several states. We must not here deceive ourselves.
Emigrants will go uniformly where they have the nearest prospect of a
comfortable future. Whether in emigrating they shall continue their
connection with their old home, or whether their children shall be
completely denationalized is a matter with which very few emigrants concern
themselves; and considering the amount of education they generally possess,
this need excite no surprise. Hence, if Germany would unite its departing
children in a colony permanently German, and therefore new,<a id="fnanchor_261-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_261-1">[261-1]</a> it would be necessary for it to offer them, at its
own expense, at least the same advantages which they would find in older
and fully established colonies. He who would reap should not endeavor to
evade the sacrifice incident to the sowing.<a id="fnanchor_261-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_261-2">[261-2]</a>
Even great sacrifices in this direction would certainly be richly rewarded
if properly made. Probably the outlay would never be directly returned to
the national treasury; but there is all the more reason, on this account,
that there should be an indirect return by the increase of duties and other
indirect taxes.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 372]</span>On the other hand, the costly
assistance of the state in the case of merely negative emigration would, as
a rule, be folly. Who would compel the children of the great national
family, who necessarily or voluntarily remain faithful to the paternal
roof, to pay tribute to those who turn their backs on the old home for
ever? The wealthy especially who remain in the country have to put up with
the disadvantage of paying higher wages for labor.</p>
<p>Simple humanity requires that the state should not be blind to the
movement of emigration, nor abandon it to all the risks of improvident
liberty. Hence it should endeavor to remove the ignorance prevailing on
questions of emigration. It should require personal and other guaranties
that emigration agents are not simply dealers in men, and that the
contracts made with ship-owners by emigrants are really performed. It
should exercise a strict superintendence over the mode of transportation of
emigrants, and see to it that its consuls accredited to America, etc.
assist them by word and deed.<a id="fnanchor_261-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_261-3">[261-3]</a> The legislation of Bremen is a model in this

of five thousand thalers, shall be entitled to receive and contract with
emigrants for passage; to each passenger shall be allotted a space of at
least twelve square feet of surface and six feet high; provision shall be
made for the longest possible time of passage; for instance, for thirteen
weeks for a voyage northerly from the equator. At the same time, the
ship-owner is required to give security that in case of accident to the
vessel, disabling it in such a way as to unfit it to continue the journey,
he shall return the fare of all passengers saved, and pay them an
additional sum of from twenty to forty thalers, according to the length of
the passage, to cover the cost of salvage, to support themselves for the
time being, and enable them to continue their journey. The entire matter is
controlled by a rigid system of ship-investigation, and is under the
superintendence of a board of officers, made up of senators and members of
the chamber of commerce.<a id="fnanchor_261-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_261-5">[261-5]</a> Among English

 is most minutely provided for, even the form of the passage ticket. The
 old law of 1803, drawn up in accordance with the advice of the Scotch
 Highland Society, was apparently devised in the interest of the emigrants;
 but it contained a multitude of minute requirements suggested by a desire
 on the part of the advisers to restrict emigration. Hence it was, in
 practice, by consent of both parties, always evaded. Compare <i>Lord
 Selkirk</i>, Observations on the present State of the Highlands of

<p class="center smaller">EMIGRATION AND PAUPERISM.</p>
<p>As a very rare exception, an emigration suddenly undertaken, well
directed and on a very large scale, may be made to constitute the efficient
means preparatory to the abolition of pauperism. Where, for instance, by
reason of the subdivision of the land into extremely small parcels, farming
on a diminutive scale has come to preponderate; where the popular
home-industries have been reduced to a miserable condition by the
immoderate competition of great foreign manufacturers and machinery, the
hopelessness of the situation consists principally in this: that every
improvement made must be preceded by a concentration of the forces of
labor, and their combination with the powers of capital; which for the
moment renders a great number of those who have been laborers hitherto
entirely superfluous. That is, to raise the level of the whole public
economy and provide a decent livelihood for 10,000 men, it would be
necessary to condemn another 10,000 to death from starvation! Most
political doctors recoil at the thought of this transition-crisis. They
content themselves <span class="pagenum">[Pg 375]</span> with palliatives
which, in the end, cost much and afford no help. The simplest remedy here
would evidently be to cause those workmen who have become superfluous to
emigrate at the expense of the state. Next, the necessary economic reforms
should be carried out at home and the return of the evil prevented by rigid
legislation. The more sudden this emigration is, the nearer it comes to
taking place, so to speak, all at once, the less possible it is that the
increase of population should keep even pace with it. The condition of the
proletarians who remained at home could not fail to have a favorable
influence in this respect; for nothing leads men so much into contracting
reckless marriages as the total absence of any prospect of amelioration of
their condition in the future.<a id="fnanchor_262-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_262-1">[262-1]</a> <a id="fnanchor_262-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_262-2">[262-2]</a></p>

 Many of the most competent thinkers have designated such emigration as the
 only remedy for the over-population of Ireland. Compare <i>Torrens</i>,
 The Budget, passim; <i>J. S. Mill</i>, Principles, II, ch. 10; Edinburg
 Rev., January, 1850. <i>Lord Palmerston</i> retained the wealthiest
 farmers on his estates who were intending to emigrate, by causing the poor
 ones to emigrate at his own expense. The independent emigration of the
 Irish at their own expense which has been going on for some years, might
 become an incalculable gain to the English nation. By the poor law, 4 and
 5 William IV., c. 76, the English parishes are authorized, with the
 approval of the central poor board, to assist emigration to the extent of
 £10 per capita. Between 1849 and 1853, they assisted 1,826 poor persons on
 an average per annum, who received for that purpose £10,352.

 It is an interesting thought of <i>R. von Mokl</i>, Polizeiwissenschaft,
 I, 130, that real over-population, when no one was willing to emigrate of
 his own accord, might be remedied by a species of emigration-conscription
 of young adults by the drawing of lots, the right of substitution, etc.
 The ancient Italians sometimes realized this idea by the <i>ver
 sacrum</i>. Similarly in many cases of Greek emigration, by the worship of
 Apollo:<a id="fnanchor_TN117"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN117">[TN 117]</a> Compare <i>W. H.

of a family be made fruitless by the arrival of less capable foreigners.<a id="fnanchor_262a-8"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_262a-8">[262a-8]</a> The hatred existing among the members of a
higher class for parvenus from a lower corresponds in this respect to the
mutual hatred of two countries for the natives of the other, (<i>v.
Mangoldt</i>.) Considered from the point of view of the country furnishing
these migratory classes, temporary emigration has this advantage over
definitive emigration, that the persons leaving the country always maintain
their economic connection with their home.<a id="fnanchor_262a-9"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_262a-9">[262a-9]</a> <span class="pagenum">[Pg 379]</span> The most
striking example of this is afforded by those merchants, ship-owners, etc.
who are, so to speak, pioneers in foreign markets for Switzerland and
Bremen. Only there is always danger of a crisis when the usual flow is
suddenly checked.<a id="fnanchor_262a-10"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_262a-10">[262a-10]</a></p>

 The locust-like emigration from Ireland to England takes three principal
 directions: from Dublin to Liverpool, from Cork to Bristol, from the
 North-East to Scotland. This even before 1835. (<i>Berkeley</i>, Querist,
 Nr., 526 ff.) Great increase since the fare has been reduced on the
 steamers to from 4 to 6 pence. (Edinburg Rev., XLV, 54 ff.; XLVII, 236
 ff.)</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_262a-2"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_262a-2" class="pginternal">[262a-2]</a> Thus mowers emigrate from
 Württemberg and the Odenwald into the valley of the Rhine; inhabitants of
 the Alps into the South German plains, and the inhabitants of the sandy
 and healthy localities into the Hanoverian marshes and Holland;
 inhabitants of the Brabant into France. Many go from Waesland, 5 and 6
 miles distant from Holland, to sow a field manured and plowed by the owner
 with flax, and afterwards to weed and harvest it, etc., and at their own
 expense. (<i>Schwerz</i>, Belg. Landwirthschaft, II, 105.) Even in the
 sixteenth century, 20,000 Frenchmen went every year to Spain in harvest
 time. (<i>Boden</i>, Responsio ad Paradoxa, 49.) Migration of the
 East-goers (<i>Ostgeher</i>) from Wartebruch as far as Poland and Russia
 (<i>Frühling</i>, N. Landwirthsch., Ztg., 1870, 451 ff.) Galicians go into
 the Polish plains, and Poles into the Prussian low country (<i>v.
 Haxthausen</i>, Ländl. Verfassung, I, 99); Russians from the populous
 district of Oreland Poltawa etc. into the Southern steppes (<i>Kohl</i>,
 Reise, II, 118), and also out of Northern woody districts to Jaroslay,
 where they give themselves to the cultivation of the fields (<i>v.
 Haxthausen</i>, Studien, V, 198); Gallegos into the Portuguese wine
 region; inhabitants of the Abruzzi into the Roman Campagna
 (<i>Galiani</i>, Della Moneta, V, 4); Calabrians to Naples. In Tuscany,
 almost the entire cultivation of the unhealthy plains is done by the
 inhabitants of the mountains. Even in Africa migrations by the
 <i>fulahs</i> into the plains before them (<i>Ritter</i>, Erdkunde, I,
 349); of the inhabitants of the cataracts of the Nile into Lower Egypt,
 where they remain from six to eight years, and where they are in great
 favor because of their honesty as gate-keepers and pack-carriers.

 In Paris, a great many masons and carpenters from Lothringen and Limousin,
 who return after from 6 to 7 months. The number of these migratory
 building workmen is estimated at over 40,000. (<i>Wolowski.</i>) Thus
 thousands of brick makers migrate from Vicentini and Friaul into Austria
 and Hungary; from the vicinity of lakes Como and Lugan, masons have been
 spread over all Italy, and this, it is said, has been going on a thousand
 years, (<i>v. Rumohr</i>, Reise in die Lombardei, 135 ff.) Yearly
 migration of about 3,000 brick finishers from Lippe-Detmold, which is very
 opportunely directed by the government. (<i>F. G. Schulze</i>, Nat. Oek.,
 606.)</p>

 In the Apennines,<a id="fnanchor_TN118"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN118">[TN 118]</a> almost every valley
 has its own migration-district. Thus the Modeneses go to Corsica, and the
 Parmesanes to England. The migration from the German Tyrol amounts yearly
 to between 16,000 and 17,000 men. (<i>v. Reden</i>, Zeitschrift für
 Statistik, 1848, 522.) In the Canton of Tessin, over 11,000 passes are
 given for this purpose yearly; that is, to more than 10 per cent. of the
 entire population. The majority go to Upper Italy, but some go to Russia.
 The cheese-makers, pack-carriers and dealers in chestnuts, migrate from
 fall to spring; masons, glaziers, etc. in summer.</p>

 Savoyards as "shoe-blacks" etc. in Paris (<i>L. Faucher</i>, La Colonie
 des S. à Paris); Portuguese, as peddlers and pack-carriers in large cities
 in Brazil (<i>Jahn</i>, Beitr., 33); Gallegos in the large cities of Spain
 and Portugal as water-carriers; Bergamasks, in Milan and Genoa as
 pack-servants, where they constitute a kind of guild; the inhabitants
 about Lake Orta (south of the Lago Maggiore) as waiters, and hence the
 inns there are very good; Bohemian musicians, who carry on quite a
 different business at home during the winter; Grisons, as confectioners
 all over Europe. Many villages obtain from this source 20,000 florins.
 (<i>Röder und Tscharner</i>, C. Graübundten, I, 337.) There are at this
 time about three million people from China, and almost exclusively from
 the conquered and oppressed province of Fokien, in Farther India, where
 they execute the finer kinds of labor. (<i>Ritter</i>, Erdkunde, IV, 787
 ff.)</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_262a-6"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_262a-6" class="pginternal">[262a-6]</a>
 In Tessin, the fields are tilled, and badly enough, by old men, women etc.
 The men spend in the taverns and in all kinds of vice what they saved
 during the working season (<i>Franscini</i>, C. Tessen, 156 ff.) Those who
 migrate from the vicinity of Osnabrück into Holland are said to bring back
 with them yearly about 100,000 thalers; but their abstinence from warm
 food, their bivouacking<a id="fnanchor_TN119"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN119">[TN
 119]</a> etc., to which they have recourse for the sake of frugality, lays
 the germs of numberless diseases. (<i>J. Möser</i>, P. Ph, I, 14 ff.)
 There are serious complaints of the demoralization of women produced in
 England by the gang-system, in which roving workmen, mostly Irish, are
 employed under a gang master to perform contract work. (<i>L. Faucher</i>,
 Etudes sur l'Angleterre, 2, ed. I, 383, ff.)</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_262a-7"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_262a-7" class="pginternal">[262a-7]</a>
 Hence, for instance, Osnabrück complained bitterly of the migration to
 Holland, because it raised the wages of servants. However, the absolute
 freedom of removal from one place to another produces not only a leveling
 of wages, but also an absolute rise of the rate of wages, as may be seen
 by contrasting it with the <i>glebae adscriptio</i>. Compare <i>supra</i>,
 § 160.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_262a-8"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_262a-8" class="pginternal">[262a-8]</a>
 Great danger to the national life of the English people by immigration
 from Ireland. The Irish laborers, bare-footed and ragged, restricting
 themselves to potatoes and whisky, have carried their disgusting habit of
 living in cellars, and of congregating several families together into one
 room, even with pigs as companions, over to England. (<i>Th. Carlyle</i>,
 On Chartism, 28 ff.; <i>G. C. Lewis</i>, The Condition of the Irish in
 England.) It is said that, in 1819, in London alone, there were over
 70,000 Irish; in 1826, over 119,000. (Edinb. Rev. XLVII.) Even <i>J. S.
 Mill</i> would have no hesitation to prohibit this emigration to prevent
 the economic contagion spreading to English workmen. (Principles, I, ch.
 14, 6.) Fortunately now Irish emigration has taken the direction of
 America, where there is more room. Whether in future Chinese emigration
 may not greatly endanger the condition of the lower classes, first in
 America and Australia, and then indirectly in Europe, <i>quære</i>. It is
 estimated that between 1856 and 1859, 78,817 Chinese emigrated to the
 United States. In Australia, to deter them from immigration, a tax of £10
 per capita has been imposed on their entry into the country.

 The Grisons had, during the 17th century, accustomed themselves to living
 some time in the Venetian territory as shoemakers, 1,000 at a time. The
 blow was all the more severe when Venice, in 1766, expelled all the
 families. Since that time most of the Grison confectionaries in the
 principal cities of Europe have had their origin. (<i>Röder und
 Tcharner</i>, C. Graudbundten, I, 56.) The practice of engaging
 mercenaries as troops was of great assistance, especially in the interior
 of Switzerland. During the war of 1690 ff., there were nearly 36,000 Swiss
 hirelings in the French army. Shortly before 1789, even during the period
 of peace in France, Italy, Spain and Holland, their number may be
 estimated to have been at least 30,000. (<i>Meyer v. Knonau</i>, Gesch.
 der Schweiz. Eidgenossenschaft, II, 104, 464.) No wonder, therefore, that
 the cessation of the Swiss guards caused a frightful crisis. Expulsion of
 the Tessinians from Lombardy, 1853.</p>
<p class="p2 center"><a id="S263"></a>SECTION CCLXIII.</p>
<p class="center smaller">CONCLUSION.</p>
<p>That the economy of no nation can continue to grow <i>ad infinitum</i>
is, in general, as easy to believe<a id="fnanchor_263-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_263-1">[263-1]</a> as it is difficult to point out with a specification
of particulars what are the limits which cannot be exceeded. This would be
possible first <span class="pagenum">[Pg 380]</span> in the case of
agriculture. Here there are points beyond which every man practically
versed in the art can see, that an increase of the gross product must be
attended by an absolute decrease in the net product.<a id="fnanchor_263-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_263-2">[263-2]</a> But even supposing that a <span class="pagenum">[Pg
381]</span> people had reached this point in their entire agriculture, they
might still carry on industries, commerce, perform personal services for
other nations, and obtain remuneration therefor in the means of subsistence
and manufactured articles. If our nation has once entered on this path, it
is evident that every improvement of its industry, every advance made by
foreign countries in the production of raw material, manufactures and the
consumption of services must result in a growth of our economy. David Hume
was of opinion that industrial preponderance was in a necessary and
continual state of transition from one country to another. A very highly
developed state of industry made a country rich in money but enhanced the
price of the means of subsistence, and the rate of wages; until finally it
became impossible for it to compete in the markets of the world with
cheaper countries, and industry, in consequence, emigrated to these.<a id="fnanchor_263-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_263-3">[263-3]</a> But it is easy to see how all such limits are
extended by the modern improvements in transportation, and the consequent
facilitation of importation; and how much the remedy mentioned in § 198 has
gained in importance by the modern advances made in machinery and the
preponderance in so many respects of machine over hand labor.<a id="fnanchor_263-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_263-4">[263-4]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 382]</span>But here it is necessary to
distinguish between the "applied" and only practical political economy, and
"pure political economy." (§ 217.) A development thus continued would be
attended with great difficulty even if the whole world constituted one
great empire. We need only mention Austria, where some provinces have
remained in a very backward, almost medieval condition, while others have
for a long time manifested the symptoms of over-population. How much more
in different states. An uncivilized nation will frequently not care to
increase its consumption of our manufactures, if to do so it becomes
necessary to carry on its agriculture more industriously. Another nation
that has already tasted of the fruit of the tree of economic knowledge may
not be satisfied with the mere production of raw material forever. In time
it may want to carry on commerce and industry itself, and hence consider
the breaking of its commercial course with us as a species of emancipation
from us. And, further, how if other highly cultivated nations should
compete with us in the markets of countries which produce merely raw
material? if such rivals should wage war in which each party should harm
his adversary for the mere love of doing harm, and not unfrequently in
opposition to its own economic interests? I know of no period the
development of which has not been attended by such disturbances, and hence
they cannot be said to be entirely unnatural.<a id="fnanchor_263-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_263-5">[263-5]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 383]</span>And even at home and among highly
civilized nations, there are wont to be many obstacles to advancement on
this road of progress. Every great economic change is connected as cause
and effect, with a variety of political, social and other reformations
which are never accomplished without great hardship and hesitation.<a id="fnanchor_263-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_263-6">[263-6]</a> Where the division of labor has been developed
to any extent, the formerly existing circumstances which must be
surrendered for the sake of progress are generally synonymous with the
interests of some class. This class opposes the improvement, and a struggle
becomes necessary to carry it out. But under certain circumstances, a long
delay in effecting a necessary reform may paralyse or poison the minds of
the people to such an extent that they may afterwards have neither the will
nor the power to successfully advance. This is the most important exception
to the rule laid down in § 24. The happier the ethnographic and social
composition of a people, the better the national spirit, the more skillful
the form of its constitution, the less frequently will it happen.<a id="fnanchor_263-7"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_263-7">[263-7]</a> All this is true especially of over-population
and the plethora<a id="fnanchor_263-8"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_263-8">[263-8]</a> of capital which so
easily injure the morality of a people. New inventions also, by means of
which the limits of the possibility of production may be incalculably
extended can <span class="pagenum">[Pg 384]</span> be expected only from
nations where there is no intellectual decline.<a id="fnanchor_263-9"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_263-9">[263-9]</a></p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_263-1"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_263-1" class="pginternal">[263-1]</a>
 There are, indeed, different opinions on this matter, and they were
 preponderant during the second half of the eighteenth century. Compare
 <i>Condorcet</i>, Tableau historique,<a id="fnanchor_TN120"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN120">[TN
 120]</a> des Progrès de l'Esprit humain, especially Epoque X, in which he
 treats of future progress. Nevertheless, he obscurely alludes (Œuvres,
 VIII, 350) to a time when no further increase of population should take
 place. <i>Malthus</i>, Principle of Population, III, ch. 1, thoroughly
 demonstrates that in regard to the great prolongation of human life which
 he foresaw, the idea of the indefinite and that of the infinite were
 confounded with each other.</p>
<p class="footnote">In that young and vigorous country, the United States
 of America, we find a popular school which, to say the least, hints at the
 principle of infinite growth. Thus, for instance, <i>Peshine Smith</i>
 (Manual of Political Economy, New York, 1853) teaches that the means of
 subsistence consumed at the place of production are not destroyed, but may
 return just as much to the soil in the form of manure as they had
 previously drawn from it (ch. 1). Capital has a tendency to increase more
 rapidly than population (ch. 6). The rate of wages has a tendency to
 increase with the increase of population (ch. 5). Mechanical progress
 increases the value of human labor and causes that of capital to decline
 relatively (ch. 3). He reverses, with <i>Carey</i>, Ricardo's law of rent
 (ch. 2).</p>
<p class="footnote"><i>Carey</i>, also, relying on the assumption that
 more fertile land is brought under cultivation as civilization advances,
 allows us to see no limits whatever to this growth. (Past, Present and
 Future, ch. 3.) Still more clearly is the principle of unlimited and
 continually accelerated growth laid down in his Principles of Social
 Science, I, 270. <i>Carey</i> illustrates this principle by means of the
 example of the continually accelerated motion of a falling body, without
 noticing the practical <i>ad absurdum deductio</i> involved in it, that at
 the end of the thousandth second a falling body reaches a velocity of
 1,000,000 feet. (loc. cit., 204.) But even in England, at present, we find
 such thoughts at times. <i>Banfield</i>, for instance, can scarcely
 understand how the relative rates of wages, interest and rent can
 decrease, except by an increase of their absolute amounts. See his
 Organization of Industry, passim. And so <i>v. Prittwitz</i> entertains
 the most rosy-colored hopes. He has no doubt that all governments which
 are still bad will see the error of their ways and correct them. (Kunst
 reich zu werden, 79.)</p>
<p class="footnote">The growth of capital and even of human wealth in
 general is capable of indefinite increase (81). The rate of interest would
 sink almost to zero if so much capital were accumulated that no
 "undertakers" could be found who care to use it (305). Large farming will
 entirely cease in the future (307), and when the system of railroads is
 entirely completed, the whole earth will present the appearance of one
 immense park (29). He would allay all fear concerning the exhaustion of
 combustible material by pointing out the possibility consequent upon
 improved means of communication, that a great many of the inhabitants of
 the colder regions of the earth might migrate in winter to a warmer
 climate (21). At the same time, artesian wells might be made to bring to
 the surface the internal heat of the earth, or metallic plates connected
 with the wings of a windmill, might be made to generate heat by their
 friction on one another (22). See the same author's Andeutungen über
 künftige Fortschritte und die Gränz en der Civilization, 21 Aufl.,

 According to § 165, we might say: where the product of the workman last
 employed is not sufficient to meet his own wants. Thus <i>J. B. Say</i>
 says that only that can be considered a product, the utility of which is
 at least equal to its cost. He makes use of the example where a three
 days' journey is necessary to obtain the food requisite for one. As the
 limits of production he gives the following: too few human wants; too
 costly methods of production; too high taxes, natural obstacles created by
 infertility or too great distance. (Traite I, ch. 15. Cours pratique, I,

 England is especially well situated in this respect, in consequence of its
 excellent commercial position and its surplus of the principal auxiliary
 products, such as coal, iron, etc. Should the coal-beds of such a
 manufacturing country be ever entirely exhausted, it is scarcely possible
 to see, from our present point of view, how the most rapid and most
 frightful decline of its national economy could be averted! Compare the
 opening address before the British Association, by Armstrong, at Newcastle
 (1863), who prophecies the exhaustion of the English coal-beds in 212
 years at the rate at which coal had been consumed during the eight
 preceding years. According to the report of the royal committee on the
 coal question (1871, vol. III), Great Britain has still attainable
 deposits, that is 4,000 feet deep, 90,207,000,000 tons of coal in its coal
 beds already known; and in beds not yet worked, 56,273,000,000 tons.
 Compare, also, <i>Jevons</i>, The Coal Question (1866). It is estimated
 that the most productive French coal-field will be exhausted in 100 years.

 Even <i>J. S. Mill's</i> views on the probability of perpetual peace on
 earth are altogether too rosy: Principles III, ch. 17, 5. This is still
 truer of <i>Buckle</i>. History of Civilization, I, ch. 4. In the modern
 state-system of Europe, there is wont to be in each generation, a peaceful
 half and a warlike one, which follow each other as ebb and flow. I need
 only mention the preponderance of peace between 1714 and 1740, between
 1763 and 1793, and between 1815 and 1853. It happens frequently that at
 the close of the period of peace, intelligent and noble but unhistorical
 and therefore short-sighted minds begin to dream of perpetual peace. Even
 a man like <i>Dohm</i> (Ueber die bürgerliche Verbesserung der Juden, 227
 seq.) expected, in 1785, that considering the size and quality of armies,
 and the mutual knowledge of all countries of one another, that instead of
 actually waging war, nations might send to each other well authenticated
 statements of the strength, for instance, of their navies and of the sums
 necessary to maintain them for a number of years.</p>

 The <i>Beccaria</i>, Economia publica I, 3, 31, teaches that the limits of
 population are to be found at the point where agriculture cannot be made
 to yield an additional increase of products, and where foreign countries
 do not offer any more a counter value of their products in exchange for
 the manufactured articles and the services to be furnished them.
 Similarly, <i>Büsch</i>, Geldumlauf III, 7; otherwise, indeed, V, 15, in

 be performed by one nation for others has no limits which cannot be
 exceeded. <i>Steuart's</i> theory of the limits to the production of every
 commercial nation: Principles, I, ch. 18. <i>Lauderdale</i>, Inquiry, ch.
 5, 274 ff., says categorically, that all wealth which is produced by the
 transformation of raw material depends on the production of such raw
 material, and of the means of subsistence necessary for the support of the
 labor employed in such transformation. Excellent investigations by
 <i>Malthus</i> in the additions (1817) to the Essay on the Principles of
 Population, II, ch. 9-13. Compare <i>Roscher</i> Nationalöcon. des
 Ackerbaues, § 162. As early a writer as <i>Mirabeau</i>, Philosophie

physical world, not a particle of matter is lost—but to see their
former national personality disappear, and themselves continue to exist
only as component parts of some other nation.<a id="fnanchor_264-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_264-3">[264-3]</a> This phenomenon, indeed, finds its analogon in every
thing that is human, but seems to contradict a law of nature which very
widely prevails, viz.: that it is easier to advance in a certain direction
in proportion to the distance gone over in it already.<a id="fnanchor_264-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_264-4">[264-4]</a></p>
<p>The problem of decline, however, is solved by the enervating influence
of possession and power, an influence which only a select few among men can
escape. And yet to every external advance there must be a corresponding
advance of the interior man, else there is a fall great in proportion to
the height before attained. The greater number take their ease once they
have attained the object of their ambition. I need only cite the example of
the posterity of those men who have <span class="pagenum">[Pg 386]</span>
grown rich by unusual exertion. Success itself generates vanity and a
feeling of false security, the latter especially, inasmuch as that is
expected from the whole community, from the state for instance, from others
generally, which should be the fruits of one's own vigilance and one's own
endeavors. It should not be forgotten that the nation is made up of
individuals.<a id="fnanchor_264-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_264-5">[264-5]</a></p>
<p>In addition to this there is the striving after the new for the sake of
novelty; a striving promotive of progress in itself, and without which the
full development of the forces of civilization would probably not be
possible. But if the genius of no nation is possessed of infinite
capacities, it must happen, at last, that, in case the best has been
attained, and the demand for novelty continues, men will go over to that
which is worse. Even very great competition has here a dangerous influence,
since it raises the great mass of the incompetent to the dignity of judges,
and endeavors to seduce them by illicit means; in the arts, for instance,
sensuousness is made to take the place of the feeling of the beautiful.<a id="fnanchor_264-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_264-6">[264-6]</a></p>
<p>There is, further the process of undeceiving, inseparable from the
prosecution of any ideal purpose. Such ideals have always very much of
human weakness in them. The great crowd of ordinary men follow, as a rule,
their material interests. <span class="pagenum">[Pg 387]</span> Only
occasionally do they rise to the height of ideal things; and here we
discover the brightest points in history. Later there comes uniformly a
period of disenchantment and of exhaustion after the debauch is over. When
all the ideals accessible to the nation have been destroyed or outlived,
nothing can be done to awaken the masses from their slumber, or induce them
to shake off their inactivity.</p>
<p>As a rule, the influences which have accelerated a nation's progress and
brought it to the apogee of its social existence end in precipitating its
ruin by their further action. Every direction which humanity takes has
almost always something of evil in it, is limited in its very nature, and
cannot stand its extremest consequences.<a id="fnanchor_264-7"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_264-7">[264-7]</a> All earthly existence bears in itself, from the
first, the germs of its decay.</p>
<p>However, to calm the feeling of human liberty, we may boldly assert that
there never was a nation remarkable for its religiousness and morality
which declined so long as it preserved these highest of all goods; but then
no nation outlived their possession.</p>

 Even in the case of individuals, that death is necessary is not
 susceptible of absolute demonstration; but no one doubts it, because of
 the experience so frequently repeated; an experience, however, which

 Remarkable controversy<a id="fnanchor_TN121"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN121">[TN
 121]</a> between <i>Hume</i> and <i>Tucker</i>. The former had charged the
 latter with holding the opinion that industry and wealth must necessarily
 continue to advance indefinitely; and yet all things had in them the germs
 of decay. <i>Tucker</i>, on the other hand, remarked that all he wished to
 say was that no one could point out where progress must necessarily cease.
 All political bodies like all natural bodies might decay; but it is not
 necessary that they should. With good laws and morality they would become
 more vigorous with increasing age. A great deal depended here on the more
 general distribution of property, on the assurance that industry would
 meet with its reward, and on the removal of the principal defects in the
 English electoral system. (Four Tracts, 477 seq. Two Sermons, 30.) Most
 political economists are of the same opinion; thus <i>McCulloch</i>,
 Principles, II, 3. See, however, the last two sections in <i>Ferguson</i>,
 History of civil Society.</p>

 Schools of art are generally ruined by mannerism. Of the two great means
 of education in art, the study of nature and the study of classic models,
 the latter is the easier, and the former is readily neglected for it. Then
 there is the endeavor to flatter the master, which is most effectually
 done by imitating his faults; and the fact that pretending connoisseurs
 are most cheaply satisfied by mannerism.</p>

 There is a peculiar charm, very productive in itself, attaching to the
 cultivation of a field which has been but little cultivated, and which,
 therefore, has the advantage of promising something new. On the other
 hand, the decline of almost all literatures begins with this, that writers
 and readers no longer think out completely the forms of speech, modes of
 expression, etc. to which they have become used, as their original
 creators did; a great temptation to have recourse to a more and more spicy
 literary style. <i>J. S. Mill</i> considers the stationary state
 (Principles, IV, ch. 6) a very pleasant one to contemplate, but he
 overlooks the very important fact, that as men are constituted it
 uniformly introduces national decline.</p>

 Great rulers, of whom it is said that they conquered the world by

 the Great and Charlemagne if they had lived one generation more?</p>
<p class="p2 center"><a id="S265"></a>SECTION CCLXV.</p>
<p class="center smaller">CONCLUSION.</p>
<p>All the separate nations which have lived side by side, or followed one
another, are embraced under the general name, humanity. Who would deny the
existence of a point, viewed from which humanity might be seen to
constitute one great whole; all the variations and differences in its life
only one great plan, one wonderful sovereign decree of the divine will,
grandly and wonderfully executed by God? Or who is so bold as to say that
he stands on this point himself? Theologians should be the last to do it,
since even the apostle Paul calls <span class="pagenum">[Pg 388]</span>
God's ways inscrutable. So long as we do not even know whether we live in
one of the first or one of the last decades of humanity, every system of
universal history in which each nation and period is made to take its place
in due subordination to its superiors, can be only a castle in the air; and
it is a matter of indifference whether the basis of the system is
philosophical, socialistic, or natural-philosophical.<a id="fnanchor_265-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_265-1">[265-1]</a></p>
<p>The usual error into which the builders of such history fall, is that
they consider the peculiarities of certain stages of civilization, which
may be shown to exist among all nations in the corresponding period of
their history as the national peculiarity of the single people with whose
history they are, for the time being, concerned. They deduce wonderful
consequences, from the premises they laid down, but which our increasing
acquaintance with other nations immediately shows to be unfounded.</p>
<p>There is, however, a number of facts really peculiar to a people which
make up the national character, and which may give to an observer endowed
with an imaginative mind, an inkling to the special vocation in the economy
of providence of a particular people. That a positive system can be
constructed from the material of such facts, I do not, indeed, think. But
they are at least a safeguard against false systems, against the improper
application of analogies, against the idle, fatalistic exaggeration of the
maxim: "nothing new under the sun!" It had almost become the fashion to
compare our present with the period of decline of the Greek and Roman
republics. Frightful parallel, in which the greatest and most undoubted
differences were frequently overlooked for smaller and certainly
questionable similarities. Is not the abolition of slavery, which has been
accomplished among all <span class="pagenum">[Pg 389]</span> the most
important nations of the present, something new and of great import from a
moral and economic point of view?<a id="fnanchor_265-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_265-2">[265-2]</a>
Can the national wealth, which depends on labor and frugality, be in any
way compared with that which was based on plunder? And so, no one can
calculate the benefits which may be reaped by posterity from the mere
continuation of the scientific and especially natural-philosophical results
obtained by former generations. The discovery of the whole earth soon to be
completed, and its probable consequence, the civilization of all nations of
any importance, must remove the danger to which all the civilized nations
of antiquity eventually succumbed, namely, destruction by entirely
barbarous hordes. Nor should the significance of the state-system of
Europe, which might be extended soon enough into a state-system embracing
the world, be under-estimated. Macedonia would not so readily have
subjugated the Hellenes and the Persians if the great powers of the west,
Rome and Carthage, had intervened at the right time. And there, too, is
Christianity, whose means of grace are at hand for every one at all times,
for his complete moral regeneration.</p>
<p>In one word, the usual argument with which the "man of experience" meets
the man of inventive genius, that there never was anything of the like seen
before, may suffice in thousands and thousands of cases; but it affords no
strict proof. It is the province of genius to compel rules to extend their
limits. But science should never forget that self-denial is necessary to
the discovery of truth.<a id="fnanchor_265-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_265-3">[265-3]</a></p>

 I mean here, especially, the attempt so frequently made (by <i>Herder</i>,

 comparison, we might accomplish something with the analogy,

 However, even such a man as Minister <i>Stein</i>, thinks that a
 laboriously acquired wealth may affect a people's morality injuriously.
 "The striving after wealth is the striving for the possession of the means
 of satisfying chiefly sensuous wants. This striving may suppress all
 nobler feelings, whether it find expression in violence or industry."
 Contrariwise, it is possible that some of the noblest of human qualities
 may be found side by side with the forcible acquisition of wealth, viz.:
 courage, patriotism. (<i>Pertz</i>, Leben Steins, II, 466.)</p>

 Compare my discourse on the relation of Political Economy to classic
 antiquity in the transactions of the royal Saxon Academy of Sciences, May,

 <i>Chr. J. Kraus</i>, has zealously discussed the question whether the
 development of humanity turns about eternally in a circle, or whether it
 forever advances to a progressively better future. He strongly advocates
 the latter view, and on grounds which appeal both to the head and to the
 heart. (Vermischte Schriften, III, 146 ff.; IV, 277 ff.)</p>

<p class="center smaller">THE MERCANTILE SYSTEM.</p>
<p>The principal peculiarities of the so-called mercantile system depend on
a five-fold over-estimation: of the density of population, of the quantity
of money, of foreign commerce, of the industries concerned with the
transformation of materials (<i>Verarbeitungsgewerbe</i>), and of the
guardianship of the state over private industry.<a id="fnanchor_A2-1-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A2-1-1">[A2-1-1]</a> All these tendencies are very intelligible, and
almost self-evident, in a sovereign city-economy (<i>Stadtwirthschaft</i>)
as opposed to the governed and worked-out (<i>ausgebeuteten</i>)<a id="fnanchor_TN122"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN122">[TN 122]</a> country districts; as they are found even in the
city-republics of later medieval times. But they are also natural in whole
national economies, during that period of youthful and rapid growth in
which the increasing density of population continues still, for a long
time, to be really only a spur and an assistance, and in which, therefore,
there can be no expression of anxiety concerning over-population; in which
the new and rapidly growing division of labor draws attention particularly
to the market-side of all businesses and to the circulation of goods; in
which the progress from trade by barter to trade by money necessarily makes
the volume of money needed even relatively greater; but especially are they
natural in that world-period in which foreign trade suddenly increased
enormously in consequence of the discovery of the <span class="pagenum">[Pg
394]</span> whole earth; when the citizen classes of the people assumed
immense importance as compared with the landed and clerical aristocracy,
and when, in the internal affairs of state absolute monarchy, and in
foreign politics, the system of equilibrium, through the instrumentality of
the great compact-formation of states prevailed.</p>
<p>All these tendencies are most intimately connected with one another. If
precious metal-money be really the essence of national wealth,<a id="fnanchor_A2-1-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A2-1-2">[A2-1-2]</a> a people who possess no gold and silver mines
themselves;<a id="fnanchor_A2-1-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A2-1-3">[A2-1-3]</a> for instance, Italy,
France and England, can become <span class="pagenum">[Pg 395]</span>
richer only through foreign trade,<a id="fnanchor_A2-1-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A2-1-4">[A2-1-4]</a> by means of a favorable balance produced by a
preponderance of their exports over their imports; and only inasmuch as
this excess is balanced by a payment in money from foreign parts. And so,
too, in foreign trade, one nation can gain only what another nation has
lost.<a id="fnanchor_A2-1-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A2-1-5">[A2-1-5]</a> Gain is promoted not only
by direct obstacles placed in the way of the exportation of the precious
metals, but still more by the value-enhancement of the exported
commodities, and by the value-diminution of the imported commodities.<a id="fnanchor_A2-1-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A2-1-6">[A2-1-6]</a> And as commodities which have undergone the
process of transformation <span class="pagenum">[Pg 396]</span> are, on an
average, more valuable than raw materials, the state can best carry out
this policy by import duties, import prohibitions, and export premiums on
manufactured articles, as well as by export duties, export prohibitions and
import premiums on raw materials.<a id="fnanchor_A2-1-7"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A2-1-7">[A2-1-7]</a> This is extremely necessary against those nations
who are superior to others in culture, wealth, the cheapness of labor and
capital; and hence the envy of the mercantilists was directed chiefly
against Holland, and after Colbert's time also against France.<a id="fnanchor_A2-1-8"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A2-1-8">[A2-1-8]</a> Such commodities as are not at all adapted to
the nature of a country, because of its climate, for instance, the nation
should produce at least in colonies of its own, that it might, in this
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 397]</span> way, emancipate itself from foreign
countries.<a id="fnanchor_A2-1-9"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A2-1-9">[A2-1-9]</a> As the clear distinction
drawn to-day between money and capital has asserted itself only since
Hume's time, the notion that prevailed for centuries, that much money, much
trade and a large population mutually conditioned one another, was a very
natural one.<a id="fnanchor_A2-1-10"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A2-1-10">[A2-1-10]</a></p>
<p>The younger and more refined conception of the mercantile system is
distinguished from the coarse Midas-believing one, by two tendencies
especially:</p>
<p>A. By the more thorough consideration of the balance of trade and the
consequent limitation of the traditional supposition, that the excess of
exports over imports would be always made up in cash money.<a id="fnanchor_A2-1-11"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A2-1-11">[A2-1-11]</a></p>
<p>B. By the extension of the field of view, so that not only the direct
but also the indirect and more remote effects of international trade were
taken into consideration.<a id="fnanchor_A2-1-12"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A2-1-12">[A2-1-12]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 398]</span>A certain over-estimation of the
circulation of goods continued to characterize even the latest adherents of
the mercantile system.<a id="fnanchor_A2-1-13"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A2-1-13">[A2-1-13]</a> Yet the caricature drawn by the tradition of more
recent text-books, of the mercantilists, is true only of the inferior ones
among them.<a id="fnanchor_A2-1-14"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A2-1-14">[A2-1-14]</a> The most distinguished
of them, Botero,<a id="fnanchor_A2-1-15"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A2-1-15">[A2-1-15]</a> for instance,
approximate more closely to the science of the present day than is usually
supposed.</p>

 Even the remarkable Florentine pamphlet of 1454 (<i>Jablonowski's</i>
 prize essay of 1878, app. Beilage, 4) complains of the decrease of
 industry principally on account of the diminution of money caused thereby.
 "Wealth is money," says <i>Ernestine</i>, essay of 1530, on the coin, and
 explains the smaller wealth of the silver-country, Saxony, as compared
 with England, France, Burgundy and Lombardy, by the greater exportation of
 commodities of these countries, by means of which they draw the silver of
 Saxony to themselves. (<i>Roscher</i>, Geschichte, I, 103.)
 <i>Bornitz</i>, Theorie wie sich der Staat diesen <i>nervus rerum</i> in
 grösster Menge verschafft: De Nummis (1608), II, 4, 6, 8. <i>A. Serra</i>,
 Sulle Cause, che possono far abbondare un Regno di Monete (1613), places
 excess of gold and silver and poverty as diametrical opposites, at the
 head of his work. <i>Hörnigk</i>, Oesterreich über Alles, wann es nur will
 (1684), says that it is "better to give two dollars which remain in the
 country for a commodity, than only one dollar which goes out of the
 country" (ch. 9). According to <i>Schröder</i>, Fürstliche Schatz- und
 Rentkammer (1686), the export of commodities is a blessing only "when we
 can turn them into silver through our neighbors." (LXX, 12.) Even
 <i>Locke</i> held similar views (Considerations of the Consequences of the
 Lowering of Interest, 1691. Further Considerations concerning Raising the
 Value of Money, 1698). On <i>Davenant's</i> inconsistency in this respect,
 compare <i>Roscher</i>, Geschichte der Englischen Volkswirthschaftslehre,
 110 ff. The quantity of money remaining the same, a country grows neither
 richer nor poorer (Christ. Wolff, Vernünftige Gedanken vom
 gesellschaftlichen Leben, 1721, § 476). <i>J. Gee</i>, Trade and
 Navigation of Great Britain considered (1730), bewails the folly of those
 to whom "money is a commodity like other things, and also think themselves
 never the poorer for what the nation daily exports," (p. 11). <i>Justi</i>,
 von Manufacturen und Fabriken (1759 seq.), considers it the principal
 object of industry simply to prevent the outflow of money. Similarly,
 <i>Pfeifer</i>, Polizeiwissenschaft (1779), II, 286. Even Frederick the
 Great considered it "true and obvious" that "a purse out of which money is
 taken every day, and into which nothing is put in turn, must soon become
 empty." (Œuvres, VI, 77).</p>

 The thirst for gold which, in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,
 drove so many emigrants to the western Eldorado, reminds one, by reason of
 its enthusiasm, of the crusades to the Holy Land. The striving after the
 making of gold which the emperors Rudolph II., Ferdinand III., Leopold I.,
 Frederick I. of Prussia, Christian IV. of Denmark, Christian II. and
 Augustus the Strong of Saxony, Heinrich Julius of Braunschweig, Frederick
 of Würtemberg, harbored, and also the Silesian and Brandenburg princes
 even during the Hussite war (<i>Riedel</i>, Cod. Dipl. Brandenb., II, 4,
 151), was, to a great extent, misplaced philosophy; men went in search of
 the <i>materia universalissima</i>,<a id="fnanchor_TN123"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN123">[TN
 123]</a> the <i>spiritus universalis</i>, from which all that is receives
 its <i>esse et fieri</i>, the universal elixir, at once the life-power of
 man, the universal medicine and maturing principle of natural bodies.

<i>Schröder</i> justifies the little estimation in which he holds internal
 commerce by saying that "a country may indeed grow and become powerful by
 its means, but cannot gain in wealth;" just as a dress embroidered with
 pearls is not made more costly by taking the pearls from the cuffs and
 putting them upon the cape. (F. Schatz- und Rentkammer, XXIX, 3.)
 According to the Fredrickian theorizer, <i>Philippi</i>, "internal trade
 scarcely deserves the name of commerce." (Vergröss. Staat, 1759, ch. 6.)
 <i>Sir J. Steuart</i> still teaches that an isolated state may, indeed, be
 happy, but that it can grow rich only through foreign trade and mining.
 (Principles, II, ch, 13.) The same fundamental thought finds expression in
 the title of <i>Th. Mun's</i> celebrated book: England's Treasure by
 Forraign Trade, or the Balance of our Forraign Trade is the Rule of our
 Treasure (1664).</p>

<i>Il est claire qu'un pays ne peut gagner, sans qu'un autre perde, et

 of the opinion: <i>ogni vantaggio di una nazione net commercio</i><a id="fnanchor_TN124"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN124">[TN 124]</a> <i>porta un danno ad un altra nazione; lo

 Even in 1761, the learned <i>Mably</i> could say: <i>la défense de

 The obstacles placed in the way of importation by governments originated,
 in great part, from views entertained on sumptuary legislation; in that of
 exportation, from a desire to prevent a scarcity of certain articles, as
 may be clearly seen in <i>Patricius</i> (De Inst. Reipublic., V, 10, I,
 8), and even in <i>Sully</i> (Mémoires, XI, XII, XIII, but especially
 XII), <i>Bornitz</i>, <i>Besold</i>, <i>Klock</i> and <i>v.
 Seckendorf</i>. (Compare <i>Roscher</i>, Gesch., I, 191, 202, 215, 247.)
 But the mercantilistic germs show themselves even in <i>Hutten</i> and
 <i>Luther</i>. (<i>Roscher</i>, I, 44, 63.) The advance made between the

 The English jealousy of Holland is represented especially by <i>Sir W.

 Hollander and other nations, 1603, Works, III, 31 ff.; <i>Sir J.
 Child</i>, A new Discourse of Trade (1690), and <i>Sir W. Temple</i>,
 Observations upon the U. Provinces (1672). Compare <i>Roscher</i>, Z.

 of France: <i>Sam. Fortrey</i>, England's Interest and Improvement (1663).

 State of England are in equal Danger with its Trade (1671), and the

 work: England's Greatest Happiness, wherein it is demonstrated that a
 great Part of our Complaints is causeless (1677). Here we find chapters
 with the title: To export Money our great Advantage; the French Trade a
 profitable Trade; Multitudes of Traders a great Advantage. <i>Petty</i>
 gave the best solution to the question in dispute, in his posthumous
 Political Arithmetic concerning the Value of Lands, etc. <i>Hörnigk</i>
 would enlist his service in the cause of the jealousy against France,
 immediately after the disgraceful defeats which Germany in 1680 ff.
 suffered in the midst of peace, by Louis XIV. Concerning smaller works of
 the same period and in the same direction, see <i>Roscher's</i> Gesch., I,

 Even <i>Peter Martyr</i> considered the colonization of countries which
 yielded the same products as the mother country of no advantage (Ocean,
 Dec., VIII, 10). On Spanish maps the most flourishing portions of America
 at present are designated as <i>tierras de ningun provecho</i>. And the
 English for a long time, ascribed value to their New England possessions,
 so far as the mother country was concerned, only to the extent it was
 possible to provide the West Indies from that quarter with corn, meat and
 wood. (<i>Roscher</i>, Kolonien, p. 262.)</p>

 Thus <i>Child</i>, spite of all his esteem for the discoverers of the
 balance-problem, calls attention to cases in which exports suffer so much
 waste (<i>Abgang</i>), or imports are sold so advantageously, that an
 apparently favorable balance made a people poorer, and an apparently
 unfavorable one, richer. From the value of the imported commodities the
 self-earned freight has to be deducted. Countries like Ireland, many
 colonies, etc., have a preponderance of exportations, because they, by
 means of the same, pay a rent to absent capitalists or to landowners. (p.
 312 ff.)</p>

<i>Mun</i> admits that, for instance, the East Indian trade makes England
 richer, although it causes the exportation of much English money. But the
 exporter of money who, in exchange for it, brings back reëxportable
 commodities, should be compared to the sower. (Ch. 4.) Similarly, <i>C.
 Roberts</i>, The Treasure of Trafficke (1641), and even <i>A. Serra</i>,
 III, 2. According to <i>Child</i>, the loss in the East Indian trade is
 compensated for chiefly by this, that England obtains there the saltpeter
 it needs to satisfy its demand, and that the ships engaged in that trade
 are peculiarly well fitted for war. (l. c.) <i>Saavedra Faxardo</i>, for
 similar reasons, declared the discovery of America to be a misfortune.

 many of the best writers on commerce, at the beginning of their books,
 allow that the wealth of a country consists not only in gold and silver,
 but also in goods of every description; but that further on they tend more
 and more to forget this qualification of the meaning of wealth. (W. of N.,

 Even <i>Colbert</i> says: nothing is more precious in a state than the
 labor of men (Lettres, Instructions et Mémoires de C. publiés par P.

 the small trade in the interior contribute equally to the welfare of
 nations. (II, 548.) I would not hesitate to do away with all privileges,
 the moment I found that greater or as great advantages attended their
 abolition. (II, 694.) His duty-system of 1664 was a simplification, but
 also an important diminution of his earlier chaotic tariff. (II, 787

<p class="center smaller">REACTION AGAINST THE MERCANTILE SYSTEM.</p>
<p>The reaction against the mercantile theory of the balance of trade,
which reached its height in Adam Smith, was based principally upon the
following considerations:</p>
<p>A. Precious-metal-money is a commodity like all other commodities, and
therefore useful only for certain purposes. It is as little to the
wealth-interest of a people, by means of a continually favorable balance,
to import infinite quantities of the precious metals, as it is to its
power-interest, by means of its commercial policy, to accumulate infinite
stores of powder. The person who possesses other exchangeable goods will be
as well able, in case of need, to obtain gold and silver therewith as to
obtain powder.<a id="fnanchor_A2-2-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A2-2-1">[A2-2-1]</a> We part with no
capital when <span class="pagenum">[Pg 400]</span> we export the precious
metals and import other commodities instead; we simply exchange thereby one
form of capital for another.<a id="fnanchor_A2-2-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A2-2-2">[A2-2-2]</a> The notion that the gain in trade is coincident
with the balance of account paid in cash, is just as palpably false in the
trade among nations as in trade among private persons.<a id="fnanchor_A2-2-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A2-2-3">[A2-2-3]</a> It would be a decided hardship to most men,
if they were to receive payment at once in money for all that they
possessed: and the nation is made up of individuals.<a id="fnanchor_A2-2-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A2-2-4">[A2-2-4]</a> And even the reasons which make payments in
cash more uniformly desirable, in the case of private persons not engaged
in mercantile pursuits, cease in the case of whole nations.<a id="fnanchor_A2-2-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A2-2-5">[A2-2-5]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 401]</span>B. But a continual over-balance
(<i>Ueberbilanz</i>) is not at all possible. Every relative increase of the
amount of money must enhance the price of commodities, lower the value of
money, and thus produce an exportation of money until a restoration of the
level with other countries.<a id="fnanchor_A2-2-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A2-2-6">[A2-2-6]</a> The prohibitions of the exportation of money, so
often resorted to, can avail nothing, because the precious metals are among
the specifically most valuable goods; and because it is easier yet to
smuggle them out of a country than to smuggle them into it.<a id="fnanchor_A2-2-7"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A2-2-7">[A2-2-7]</a></p>
<p>C. The signs by which the mercantile system supposed it could estimate
the favorableness of the balance of trade are essentially deceptive.<a id="fnanchor_A2-2-8"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A2-2-8">[A2-2-8]</a> We cannot, for instance, from the course of
exchange, determine whether the payments made by us to foreign countries
have been made for purchases, to absentees, etc., or as loans; and yet,
according to the mercantilists, the latter are as useful to us as the
former are injurious.<a id="fnanchor_A2-2-9"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A2-2-9">[A2-2-9]</a> And even the most
accurate tariff-record (<i>Zollregister</i>) of <span class="pagenum">[Pg
402]</span> the exportation and importation of commodities affords no
guaranty<a id="fnanchor_A2-2-10"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A2-2-10">[A2-2-10]</a> that, in many instances,
the rendering of the counter-value may not remain absent, by reason of
bankruptcy, shipwreck, or the emigration of property.<a id="fnanchor_A2-2-11"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A2-2-11">[A2-2-11]</a></p>
<p>D. Every act of exchange is advantageous only because through it a
greater value is received than the one parted with was. (?) Fortunately, in
normal trade, where both parties satisfy a real want, and neither party is
deceived, this is actually the case on both sides.<a id="fnanchor_A2-2-12"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A2-2-12">[A2-2-12]</a> In accordance with all this,<a id="fnanchor_A2-2-13"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A2-2-13">[A2-2-13]</a> Baudrillart is of opinion that the whole
theory of the balance of trade no longer exists.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_A2-2-1"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_A2-2-1" class="pginternal">[A2-2-1]</a>
 Even <i>Petty</i> and <i>North</i>, with their deep insight into the
 nature and functions of money, could not possibly entertain the mercantile
 theory of the balance of trade. <i>Petty</i> considers the exportation of
 money useful, even when commodities are brought back in exchange for it,
 and which are of greater value in the interior than the exported money.
 (Quantulumcunque concerning Money, 1682.) According to <i>North</i>, no
 one is richer simply because he has his property in the form of gold and
 silver plate, etc.; he is even poorer, because he allows his goods to lie
 in that shape unproductive. Hence the importation of money is, in itself,
 not more advantageous than the importation of logs of wood; at most, the
 difference that, in case of excess, it would be easier to get rid of the
 money than of the wood, is of importance. Therefore, a state need never
 care very anxiously for its supplies of money. A rich nation will never
 suffer from a want of money. (Discourses upon Trade, 1691, pp. 11, 17.)
 According to <i>Berkeley</i> (Querist, 1735, pp. 566 ff.), there is no
 greater error than to measure the wealth of a nation by its gold and
 silver. It is to the interest of a people to keep their money or to send
 it off according as its industry is thereby promoted. <i>Quesnay</i>
 declares it to be impossible that the exports of a country should be
 permanently greater than its imports: <i>tout achat est vente et toute
 vente est achat</i>.</p>
<p class="footnote"><i>Adam Smith</i> (W. of N., IV, 1) compares the
 Spanish discoverers who inquired on every island, first of all, for gold,
 to the Mongolians, whom <i>Rubruquis</i> (c. 32) was obliged to give
 information to concerning the cattle of France: "of the two, perhaps the
 Tartar nation was the nearest to the truth." Precious-metal-money may be
 even more easily dispensed with than most other commodities, since, in
 case of necessity, it can, by reason of its greater transportability be
 readily obtained from without, and can also be supplied by exchange and by
 credit. "Money makes but a small part of the national capital and always
 the most unprofitable part of it.... Money necessarily runs after goods,
 but goods do not always or necessarily run after money." <i>J. B. Say</i>
 calls the exportation of money more advantageous than that of other
 commodities, because the former is of use, not through its physical
 qualities, but only through its value, and the value of the money which
 remains behind correspondingly rises by reason of the exportation.

 Even <i>Mun</i> had, in every balance of trade, distinguished three
 persons who participated in it; the merchant might lose when the nation in
 general gained, and <i>vice versa</i>; the king, with his duties, always
 gained. (Ch. 7.) The British Merchant (p. 23) maintained even, that when
 the merchant himself gains nothing and takes his back-freight
 (<i>Rückfracht</i>) in money, his country gains the whole amount
 thereof.</p>

 "Every individual is continually exerting himself to find out the most
 advantageous employment for whatever capital he can command. It is his own
 advantage, indeed, and not that of the society, which he has in view. But
 the study of his own advantage, naturally, or rather necessarily, leads
 him to prefer that employment which is most advantageous to the society."

 For the reason that money, in international trade, for the most part,
 loses its character as money, and appears more as a commodity.
 Exhaustively in <i>Adam Smith</i> and <i>J. B. Say</i>, l. c. The English
 state paid, during the French war of the Revolution, in subsidies to
 foreign countries, £44,800,000; and yet, up to the end of 1797, imperial
 loans and the payments of private individuals included, not as much as one
 million in cash went out of the country. (<i>Rose</i>, Brief Examination
 into the Increase of the Revenue of Great Britain, 1799.) When France paid
 the five milliards to Germany, the plus value of English exportation to
 Germany above the English importation thence rose from 274,000,000 (1869)
 to 478,000,000 (1872), and the increase in the amount of French from
 39,400,000 (1869) to 131,700,000 (1873). The entire German under-balance

is wont to estimate the favorableness of the balance according to the
preponderance of that which they consider the most important element in a
nation's economy. Thus the population-enthusiasts, after the middle of the
18th century, distinguished the "balance of advantage" from the "merely
numerical:" the former is favorable to the country which, by means of its
exports, employs and feeds the greatest number of men; the latter to the

<i>List</i> (Werke, II, 31 ff.) had, after 1818, recognized that a

 able to cover their wants, supplied from abroad and then consumed, by
 their income, but were obliged to make inroads on their national
 capital.</p>

<i>Ch. Ganilh</i>, who expects a real enrichment of a nation only from
 foreign trade (Dictionnaire de l'E. P., 1826, p. 131), ascribes the most
 favorable balance to the nation that exchanges dear labor against cheap;
 that is, principally to a nation of tradesmen as contradistinguished from
 a nation of agriculturists. (Theorie de l'E. P., 1822, II, 239 ff.)</p>

<p class="center smaller">PARTIAL TRUTH OF THE MERCANTILE SYSTEM.</p>
<p>But even among the successors of Hume and Smith, a deeper insight into,
so to speak, the physics of money and of international trade must have led
to the recognition of many a truth which the mercantile system had, indeed,
badly formulated, insufficiently proved, but which it had, nevertheless, an
inkling of. And, indeed, how frequently it happens that the progress of
science proceeds from one one-sidedness, through another opposed but higher
one-sidedness, to the all-sidedness which knows no prejudice!</p>
<p>A. Precious-metal-money is, indeed, a commodity, but of all commodities,
the most current, the most many-sided in its utility, the most economically
energetic, and at the same time of peculiarly great durability.<a id="fnanchor_A2-4-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A2-4-1">[A2-4-1]</a> Money-capital, far from being the least
useful portion of a nation's capital, is rather one of its most important
parts; and especially in the higher stages of civilization, where the
division of labor has been most largely developed, is it peculiarly
productive and indispensable.<a id="fnanchor_A2-4-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A2-4-2">[A2-4-2]
</a> Here <span class="pagenum">[Pg 406]</span> it is really more likely
that the possessor of commodities may be wanting the wished for money, than
that the possessor of money should be wanting in the wished for
commodities. And, hence, the numerous half mystic expressions of the
magical power of money, which have passed into literature from the common
usage of the people, can be, by no means, considered mere errors.</p>
<p>B. Just as little, can the impossibility of the preponderant importation
of money for a long time, be asserted. Hume's rigid theory of a level, by
no means, exactly corresponds with the reality. The precious metal which
is, indeed, imported, but which does not subsequently enter into the
circulation, need exert no influence whatever on the prices of commodities
in general; and may, therefore, remain permanently in the country. Think
only of the articles made of the precious metals, which minister to
luxury,<a id="fnanchor_A2-4-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A2-4-3">[A2-4-3]</a> of buried private
treasure, of the treasures of the state, which are idly stored up; as well
as of a portion at least of most cash on hand.<a id="fnanchor_A2-4-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A2-4-4">[A2-4-4]</a> <span class="pagenum">[Pg 407]</span> From the
other side, also, the over-balance or under-balance (<i>Ueber-oder
Unterbilanz</i>) of a country may continue, a very long time, when its
internal trade with its money-need is, in the first case, an increasing,
and in the last, a decreasing one. So far, the preponderance of the
importation of money may be called a favorable sign and the preponderance
of the exportation of money an unfavorable one. And the person who thinks
that a permanent preponderance of exports or imports is not at all possible
in the way of commerce, overlooks the possibility of a very extensive
national indebtedness.<a id="fnanchor_A2-4-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A2-4-5">[A2-4-5]</a></p>
<p>C. But a distinction should be made between the <i>balance of
payments</i> and the <i>balance of trade</i> in the narrower sense of the
expression.<a id="fnanchor_A2-4-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A2-4-6">[A2-4-6]</a> In the case of the
latter, to be complete, it is necessary to carry to the credit side of the
account: 1, The exports of commodities; 2, the profit made by parties at
home by realizing on (<i>Realisierung</i><a id="fnanchor_TN126"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN126">[TN
126]</a>) the exports in foreign countries; 3, the freight-profit made by
parties at home on exports and imports, as well as in foreign carrying
trade (<i>Zwischenverkehr</i>); 4, the sale of inland ships in foreign
countries; 5, premiums and compensation for damage on account of maritime
insurance from foreign countries. On the debit side, on the other hand, the
corresponding items when foreigners have received from the home country, as
in the case of imports, etc. To obtain the general payment-balance, we have
still, in addition, on the credit side: 1, The profit from home
participation in enterprises in foreign countries and the transfers of
capital originating therefrom; 2, the interest and repayments of
money-capital <span class="pagenum">[Pg 408]</span> loaned in foreign
countries; 3, the sale of stocks (<i>Effecten</i>) to foreign countries as
well as new loans to which the home country makes in foreign parts; 4,
remittances from foreign countries to foreigners sojourning in the home
country, and money brought with them by travelers and emigrants; 5,
inheritances, pensions and extraordinary payments from foreign countries.
Then, too, on the debit-side, belong the corresponding counter-items.<a id="fnanchor_A2-4-7"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A2-4-7">[A2-4-7]</a> If we, in this way, take a survey of the
whole world, we shall perceive a treble current of the precious metals. The
first and most regular goes, in long lines, from mining countries, over to
the commercial countries of the world, and distributes the newly acquired
gold and silver as commodities according to the wants of the coinage, of
manufactures, etc. The second oscillates, as it were, in short waves from
country to country, in order to adjust the <i>plus</i> or <i>minus</i> for
the time being of payment-balances. Lastly, regular sudden currents, with
slow subsequent counter-currents, when single economic districts require to
make extraordinary drafts or shipments of the precious metals, by reason of
bad harvests, war, a disturbed double standard, etc.</p>
<p>D. Since international indebtedness has so much increased, precisely the
richest nations may have the greatest regular excess of exports over
imports; partly because of the great amount of capital, etc., which they
possess in foreign countries; partly because of the great development of
their system of credit in the interior, by means of which they find
substitutes for so great a part of the metallic currency.<a id="fnanchor_A2-4-8"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A2-4-8">[A2-4-8]</a></p>

<i>Locke</i>, Civil Government (1691), § 49, seq., emphasizes this
 durability of the value-preserving metallic money, in opposition to the
 perishable articles of consumption, as a principal element in the
 development of private property and of economic civilization. But even
 <i>Petty</i> ascribes to the precious metals a higher quality as wealth
 than to any other commodity, for the reason that they are less perishable,
 and possess value always and everywhere. Hence, he esteems foreign trade
 more highly than inland trade, and would have those businesses which
 import the precious metals protected more than others against taxation.
 (Several Essays, 1682, p. 113, 126, 159.) <i>Adam Smith</i> also
 recognizes this, at least so far as intermediate trade is concerned. (W.
 of N., IV, ch. 6.)</p>

 Even <i>Rau</i>, in his additions to <i>Storch</i> (1820), p. 397,
 concedes the peculiarly charming, vivifying power, which money possesses
 to an extent greater than any other commodity. Well distinguished whether
 the money-want of a country is already fully satisfied or not. (Ansichten
 der Volkswirthschaft, 1821, p. 157.) <i>Carey</i> exaggerates when he
 calls money the cause of the movement in society, out of which force is
 produced, what coal is to the locomotive, or food to the animal body
 (Principles of Social Science, ch. XXXII, 5), or the only want of life for
 which there is a universal demand. (Ch. XXXIII, 1.) But he rightly calls
 it the "instrument of association." Excellent demonstration, as to how, at
 the sudden outbreak of a war, of a revolution, etc., all those who have
 money on hand, even when they had previously obtained it while peace still
 prevailed, in the form of a loan, are in an infinitely better position
 than the owners of the otherwise most useful commodities. (Ch. XXXVII,
 12.) Earlier yet, <i>P. Kaufmann</i> placed the "principal character of
 money" in this, that it was "most perfect property (<i>Vermögen</i>);" and
 he calls its quality as a commodity, philosophically considered, in
 question; and judges the balance of trade according to this, that in
 commodities, interest-yielding as well as dead capital is exported, but in
 money-capital, which is always gain-engendering. (Untersuchungen im
 Gebiete der politischen Oekonomie, 1829, I, 4, 74, 80.)</p>

 In England, <i>Patterson</i> estimates the regular additional importation
 (<i>Mehreinfuhr</i><a id="fnanchor_TN127"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN127">[TN 127]</a>) of money at from
 four to five millions sterling, of which the greater part is devoted to

<i>Fullarton's</i> view (Regulation of Currencies, 1844) suffers from
 exaggeration. <i>Knies</i>, Geld and Credit, II, 285, very well shows that
 the "hoards" are by no means mere idle stores, and that, therefore, their
 void produced by the exportation of money must be soon filled up again.

 <i>Fullarton</i>. (W. of N., ch. 2, p. 250, Bas.)</p>

 Even <i>Büsch</i> (Werke, XIII, 26) says that the under-balance
 (<i>Unterbilanz</i>) of the Scotch vis-a-vis of England was for a long
 time made up in two ways, by the marriage of wealthy English heiresses and
 by Scotch bankrupts. Thus the troops, who, in the 17th century, were
 traded over to France, and in the 18th, to England by German princes,
 brought the money, in part, back again, which was exported by the
 unfavorable balance. According to <i>List</i>, the exported metals, after
 they have risen in price with us, flow back to us again; not, however, as
 exchangeable articles, but in the form of a loan, by which it is made
 possible for us to dispose of them again, and again to receive them in
 this shape. (Werke, II, 37.)</p>

 British Europe had from 1854 to 1863, a yearly surplus amount
 (<i>Mehrbetrag</i>) of imports of at least 266, and at most 1190 millions
 of marks, in the average, 764 millions; from 1864 to 1873, of at least 802
 millions, and at most 1388 millions, an average of 1104 millions; whereas,
 on the other hand, Australia, besides its great exportation of gold,
 exhibits a great excess of exports of commodities over imports. France,
 too, from 1867 to 1869, had attained to an average surplus importation
 (<i>Mehreinfuhr</i>) of 211 million marks; which is related to the fact
 that, according to <i>L. Say</i>, it received about from 600 to 700
 million francs a year in interest from foreign countries; and that from
 200 to 300 million francs were expended by foreigners, etc., traveling in
 France. Similarly, in the case of governing countries vis-a-vis of their
 dependencies; whence even the old mercantilists entertained no doubt of
 the enrichment of the former. Thus France, in 1787 ff., had a yearly
 importation of 613 million livres, and an exportation of 448 millions,
 because the colonies sent to France 150 millions more than they drew
 therefrom. (<i>Chaptal</i>, De l'Industrie, Fr., I, 134.) Hungary, from
 1831 to 1840, had a yearly exportation of 46 million florins to Austria,
 and an importation of only 30 millions. (<i>List</i>, Zollvereinsblatt.
 1843, No. 49) Algiers drew from France in 1844 to the amount of 83 million
 francs, and found a market there for only 8 millions (Moniteur), which no
 one will consider an enrichment of France. The great preponderance of
 French exports in 1831, 1848 and 1849, of Austrian, between 1874 and 1876,
 a sign of diminished purchasing capacity! When England, in March, 1877,
 imported to the amount of £35,230,000, and exported to the amount of
 £16,921,000 (against £27,451,000 and £17,739,000 in March, 1876), the
 Economist sees therein a sign that many outstanding debts were called
 in.</p>

<p class="center smaller">THE ADVANTAGES OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE.</p>
<p>The truth that no exportation is permanently possible without
importation, and that, in international trade, also, both sides better
their condition, was clear to the Italians in the fifteenth century, and in
the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries to the Netherlanders.<a id="fnanchor_A2-5-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A2-5-1">[A2-5-1]</a></p>
<p>Every nation can, through its instrumentality, for the first time,
acquire not only those commodities which nature entirely refuses to it, but
such also which it can itself produce only at a great cost.<a id="fnanchor_A2-5-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A2-5-2">[A2-5-2]</a> And here it is not so much the absolute
costs <span class="pagenum">[Pg 410]</span> of production as the
comparative which are decisive.<a id="fnanchor_A2-5-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A2-5-3">[A2-5-3]</a> The country A may be superior to the country B in
all kinds of productiveness; but when this superiority for the group of
commodities <i>x</i> amounts to only 50 per cent., and for the group
<i>y</i>, on the other hand, to 100 per cent., it is to the interest of A,
which possesses only a limited quantity of the factors of production, to
produce a surplus of the commodities <i>y</i>, and to exchange that surplus
against what it wants of <i>x</i>.<a id="fnanchor_A2-5-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A2-5-4">[A2-5-4]</a> B, also, would willingly agree to this, even if it
were not to get the commodities <i>y</i> entirely as cheap as A might
supply them, but still decidedly cheaper than their production would cost
in B itself. But, if both parties derive advantage from international
trade, there is no necessity whatever that this advantage should be equally
great on both sides. As in every struggle over prices, the gain here also
is greatest on the side of the nation whose desire to hold fast to their
own commodities is farthest <span class="pagenum">[Pg 411]</span> from
being outweighed by the want of the foreign commodity, and which, at the
same time, employs most productively the equivalent received in imports in
exchange for its exports.<a id="fnanchor_A2-5-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A2-5-5">[A2-5-5]</a> Yet, in estimating this productiveness, it is
necessary to take the whole national life into consideration.<a id="fnanchor_A2-5-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A2-5-6">[A2-5-6]</a></p>
<p>The international distribution of the precious metals is subject to the
same law. These, also, are procured most cheaply by the nation which,
directly or indirectly (by the production of counter values wished for by
the whole world), employs the most productive economic activity upon them,
and at the same time (it may be by especially well developed credit), is in
the least urgent need of them.<a id="fnanchor_A2-5-7"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A2-5-7">[A2-5-7]</a> Therefore, on the whole, their value in exchange is
wont to be lowest among the richest <span class="pagenum">[Pg 412]</span>
and most highly cultivated nations.<a id="fnanchor_A2-5-8"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A2-5-8">[A2-5-8]</a> Such a relative cheapness of gold and silver is not
only a symptom of economic power, but considering the preëminent energy of
these very commodities, at the same time, a means to procure most foreign
commodities with a smaller expenditure of one's own forces.<a id="fnanchor_A2-5-9"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A2-5-9">[A2-5-9]</a> Hence, a great change in the distribution,
hitherto usual, of the precious metals, produced, possibly, by great
advances made in production here, or by an increase in consumption there,
or by means of commercial prohibitions, etc., may be just as advantageous
to the country which receives more as hurtful for the country which pays
more;<a id="fnanchor_A2-5-10"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A2-5-10">[A2-5-10]</a> and both, all the
more as the <span class="pagenum">[Pg 413]</span> revolution in prices
enhances the most productive elements of the nation there, and here the
most unproductive.<a id="fnanchor_A2-5-11"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A2-5-11">[A2-5-11]</a> Hence, even when it
cannot, in general, be said that one branch of commerce, carried on in a
normal manner, should necessarily remain behind another in economic
productiveness, those which have nothing to fear from a disturbance of
their balance by the measures of foreign states are distinguished by the
greatest security, and those are capable of the greatest growth which
exchange articles to be manufactured (<i>Fabrikanden</i>), and the means of
subsistence against ordinary manufactured articles.<a id="fnanchor_A2-5-12"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A2-5-12">[A2-5-12]</a> <a id="fnanchor_A2-5-13"></a> <a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A2-5-13">[A2-5-13]</a></p>

<i>J. S. Mill</i> rightly calls it a remnant of the mercantile system that
 <i>Adam Smith</i> still saw the principal utility of foreign trade in the
 market for the home production which is thereby increased. But this

 imported. (Principles, II, ch. 17, 4.)</p>

 Economy (1844), No. 1, and Principles, III, ch. 18 ff. But even
 <i>Jacob</i>, Grundsätze der Polizeigesetzgebung (1809, p. 546 ff.), was
 acquainted with the truth that generally both sides gained, but the one
 party, possibly more than the other. According to <i>Lotz</i>, Revision
 (1811), I, 161, the gain and loss of each party rises and falls in
 proportion to the difference between the degrees of value which each
 party, so far as he is himself concerned, attaches to the goods given and
 the goods received. And even <i>Cantillon</i>, Nature du Commerce (1155),
 p. 226, 369 ff., had a presentiment of the reason why countries having a
 low value in exchange of money can continue notwithstanding to sell in
 foreign countries. And so, too, <i>Hume</i>, Essays (1752), On Interest,
 who, without looking through the spectacles of the mercantile system,
 perceived that countries with a flourishing trade must necessarily draw
 much gold and silver to themselves. Recently, <i>Cairnes</i> has shown by
 practical examples that Australia imports Irish butter and Norwegian wood,
 and the Barbadians meat and flour from New York, although both might
 themselves produce such articles cheaper. (Essays, etc., 1873. Leading

 not make a people richer because they receive the metals for other values,
 but because they produce and sell more than they purchase and consume; the
 result of which naturally is that the difference must consist in values
 capable of being capitalized." Kaufmann draws a distinction according as
 the imported goods come into the country in the form of dead or
 interest-bearing capital. He illustrates his view by the case of a peasant
 who sells his seed-corn in order to purchase a finer hat with the
 proceeds. (Untersuchungen, I, 96, 81 seq.)</p>

 International trade makes imported commodities cheaper and exported
 commodities dearer, but the aggregate of consumers gain more in the former
 case than they lose in the latter, because they now enjoy the blessings of
 the international division of labor. But, even with this general
 enrichment, single classes of the people, and even the majority, may have
 to suffer; as, for instance, when in the exchange of corn against iron,
 the cheapening of the iron profits the people less than the consequent
 dearness of corn injures them. (<i>Fawcett</i>, Manual, 391.)</p>

 "Gold and silver are by the competition of commerce distributed in such
 proportions amongst the different countries of the world as to accommodate
 themselves to the natural traffic which would take place if no such metals
 existed and the trade between countries were purely a trade of barter."
 (<i>Ricardo</i>, Principles, ch. 7.) In most direct opposition to the
 mercantile system, he represents the distribution of the precious metals
 to be not the cause but the effect of national wealth. A nation rapidly
 growing in wealth will obtain and keep a larger quota of the general
 supply of gold and silver. (The high Price of Bullion, 1810.) On the other
 hand, it depends on the one-sided abstraction with which <i>Ricardo</i>
 loves to pursue certain assumptions, that every exportation of money is
 made to signify a peculiar cheapness of money, and <i>vice versa</i>.
 (Opposed by <i>Malthus</i>, Edinb. Rev., Febr., 1811.) <i>Carey's</i>
 frequently repeated assertion, that gold and silver always flow towards
 those markets where they are cheapest (Principles of S. Science, I, 150,

 Let us suppose that, hitherto, the English had supplied their demand for
 wine from France, and paid therefor in commodities made of steel; and that
 now France prohibits the importation of the latter and requires gold
 instead. If the English take this gold out of their own circulation, the
 value in exchange of the gold which remains to them rises; the prices of
 all commodities fall, state debts and private debts become more
 oppressive, etc. If, to avoid this, they send their steel wares, which
 France has rejected, to California, to obtain gold there in exchange, they
 find that California has as much of steel wares as it requires, and that
 it can be induced to extend its consumption of them only by a
 corresponding lowering of their price. But if, on the other hand, the gold
 which has flowed towards France has produced a rise in the price of
 commodities, and a decrease in the exportation of commodities; and has
 then flowed out of the country, to Germany for instance; England may in
 consequence be placed in a position to effect its payments for French wine
 with the gold which its manufactured articles have been exchanged against
 in Germany. But all this always supposes that the prices of commodities
 have fallen in England and risen in other countries; that is, a changed
 and, so far as England is concerned, an unfavorable distribution of the
 precious metals—which is found in connection with a relatively
 decreased productiveness of English labor. The English cost of production
 may yet continue to be covered, notwithstanding; but, when it has been
 diminished by a lowering of wages, interest, etc., the national wealth
 suffers in consequence. Compare <i>Torrens</i>, Budget, p. 50 ff., who
 precisely on this bases the greater security of trade between the mother
 country and its colonies; and which also found expression in the Peel
 reform plan of 1842 ff. <i>Adam Smith</i> approximated to this view when
 he ascribed a more favorable balance to the country which paid for its
 imports with its own instead of with foreign products. (W. of N., IV, ch.
 3-2, p. 329, Bas.)</p>

<i>Torrens</i> imagines an English manufacturer who employs raw material =
 100 quarters of corn and manufactured wares = 100 bales of cloth (the
 quarter of corn and the bale of cloth supposed to be of equal value) and
 whose product = 240 bales in value; and compares him with an American
 agriculturist who, by means of the same outlay of capital, harvests 240
 quarters of corn. The trade between them restores to each not only his
 outlay, with twenty per cent. profit, but puts them in a position to
 repeat their production on a larger scale. Only the quantity of fertile
 land can put a limit to this growth; for corn and cloth help produce each
 other, and the cheapness of the one promotes the cheapness of the other,
 which can not, by any means, be said, for instance, of the exchange
 between vanilla and satin. (Budget, p. 268 ff.) Compare <i>Roscher</i>,

 The important controversy concerning absenteeism may be answered in
 accordance with the principles laid down in this chapter. The mercantile
 system considered the rent sent to absentee landlords or capitalists as a
 tribute paid to foreign countries; but certainly improperly, as such rent
 is only the fruit of their property which the owners might have consumed
 in their own country, without giving any one a particle of it. Besides,
 these rents are not sent in cash to foreign countries, but in the form of
 those commodities to the exportation of which the country is peculiarly
 well adapted. Let us suppose, for instance, that the Irish absentees had
 all left the country at once. The tradesmen, personal servants, etc., to
 whom they had hitherto furnished employment would be greatly embarrassed
 to find a market for their services, etc., but the producers of linen and
 meat would have largely increased their exports, because an entirely new
 demand for their products would have arisen through the farmers of the
 absentees. The reverse would necessarily happen if all absentees were
 suddenly called home. Absenteeism which has lasted a long time injures no
 one economically. Many, recently, laud it even, because it permits every
 nation to devote their energies to the branches of production for which
 they are best qualified: Paris, for instance, to theatrical and luxury
 wares. The savings made by the English absentees on the continent, where
 things are cheaper, turn eventually to the advantage of England. (Thus,
 even <i>Petty</i>: Political Anatomy of Ireland, p. 81 ff. <i>Foster</i>,
 On the Principle of Commercial Exchanges between Great Britain and
 Ireland, 1804, p. 76 ff. Edinb. Rev., 1827. <i>F. B. Hermann</i>,

 seq. <i>Lady Morgan</i>, On Absenteeism, 1825.) An aversion for
 absenteeism plays a chief part in all Carey's writings. Thus, even in his
 Rate of Wages, 45 ff.</p>
<p class="footnote">On medieval complaints concerning the absenteeism of
 monasteries: <i>Bodmann</i>, Rheingauische Alterthümer, 751. From a higher
 point of view, it cannot, indeed, be ignored that absenteeism, largely
 developed, cripples the organic whole of national life. The most highly
 cultured and influential classes become estranged from their country, the
 great mass remaining behind coarser, economic production more one-sided,
 and all social contrasts more sharply defined. Disturbances in Rome, when
 Diocletian removed his residence from there; the decline of the
 Netherlands, very much promoted by the discontent which Philip II.'s
 departure for Spain produced. It was estimated, however, in 1697, that the
 English absentees caused a gain to France of £200,000 per annum.
 (Discourse of Trade, p. 93.) It is said that about 1833, 80,000 Englishmen
 traveled on the continent, and consumed £12,000,000 there. (<i>Rau.</i>)
 According to <i>Brückner</i>, the Russians who travel in foreign countries
 take 20,000,000 rubles a year out of the country with them.
 (<i>Hildebrand's</i> Jahrb., 1863, 59.) That the countries which receive
 these travelers receive no very great benefit from them, see in <i>J. B.
 Say</i>, Cours pratique. In Paris, there were, even in 1797, so many
 strangers who so enhanced the rents paid for <i>maisons garnies</i> that
 their expulsion was proposed. (<i>A. Schmidt</i>, Pariser Zustände, III,

<p class="center smaller">INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL TREATIES.</p>
<p>All international commercial treaties have this object in common: to
moderate the impediments to trade which arise <span class="pagenum">[Pg
415]</span> from the differences and even from the enmities of states.
According to time and character, they fall into three groups:</p>
<p>A. <i>Medieval</i>, where a barbarous state for the first time promises
foreign merchants in general legal security, without which regular trade is
unthinkable. Such treaties, where their provisions are not a matter of
course, must be certainly considered as a salutary advance; and they may,
under certain circumstances, be necessary even to-day.<a id="fnanchor_A2-6-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A2-6-1">[A2-6-1]</a></p>
<p>B. <i>Mercantilistic</i> treaties, which close, perhaps, even a bloody
commercial war carried on against a rival,<a id="fnanchor_A2-6-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A2-6-2">[A2-6-2]</a> or which <span class="pagenum">[Pg 416]</span> by a
closer connection with a state, whose rivalry is not so much feared, are
intended to moderate the worst consequences of a general seclusion.<a id="fnanchor_A2-6-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A2-6-3">[A2-6-3]</a> Consistently carried out, and without any
regard for consequences, the mercantile system really means a war of each
state against all others, and it is no mere accident that after the
cessation of the wars of religion (1648) and before the beginning of the
war of the French revolution (1792), commercial wars occupy the foreground.
Such economic alliances as are entered into in these treaties generally
unite states which, by reason of the very different nature of their land
and their different national culture, are adapted to production of very
different kinds, and which, at the same time, have a common political
interest.<a id="fnanchor_A2-6-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A2-6-4">[A2-6-4]</a> Each party here
agrees with the other to give a preference to its subjects in trade, to not
exceed certain maxima of duties, etc.<a id="fnanchor_A2-6-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A2-6-5">[A2-6-5]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 417]</span>The art of the negotiator was
employed to overreach the other contractant in relation to the balance of
trade.<a id="fnanchor_A2-6-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A2-6-6">[A2-6-6]</a> It was considered a
special matter of congratulation to induce a less highly developed nation
to abandon the traditional means employed to artificially elevate its
industries. Hence it is, that such friendly treaties frequently contained
the germs of the bitterest enmity.<a id="fnanchor_A2-6-7"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A2-6-7">[A2-6-7]</a> A popular remnant of this second group <span class="pagenum">[Pg 418]</span> has been noticeable even in recent times, when in
diplomatic negotiations concerning the reciprocal modification of duties,
it was considered an overreaching and even as an outrage, in case one state
made more "concessions" than it received:<a id="fnanchor_A2-6-8"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A2-6-8">[A2-6-8]</a> evidently, a confusion of the producers of the
industry in question with the whole nation.</p>

freedom of trade.<a id="fnanchor_A2-6-9"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A2-6-9">[A2-6-9]</a> Two provisions
especially are characteristic <span class="pagenum">[Pg 419]</span> here:

the home country in what relates to the ship-duties, etc.;<a id="fnanchor_A2-6-10"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A2-6-10">[A2-6-10]</a> and the promise that the products of the

most favored nation.<a id="fnanchor_A2-6-11"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A2-6-11">[A2-6-11]</a> <a id="fnanchor_A2-6-12"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A2-6-12">[A2-6-12]</a> Whether this preparation for the universal
freedom of trade is better made through the medium of an international
treaty or of national legislation cannot be answered generally.<a id="fnanchor_A2-6-13"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A2-6-13">[A2-6-13]</a> Besides, in our day, the

 The treaty of commerce between England and Morocco, of the 9th of
 December, 1856, specially covenants that the countrymen of a debtor shall
 not be held responsible for debts in the creation of which they had no
 part; that between England and Mexico, in 1826, guaranties, among other
 things, that prices shall be freely determined between buyers and sellers
 (art. 8), freedom from compulsory loans, and from forced conscription for
 military duty (10), the exercise of one's religion, and the inviolability
 of graves (13); things which were not yet matters of course in Mexico!
 Similar agreements between Spain and England in 1667; between Spain and
 Holland in 1648 and 1713; and even in 1786, between England and France.
 Commercial treaties of this kind are found very early and very frequently
 among the ancients. Compare the Arcadian-Ægean in <i>Pausan</i>, VIII, 5,
 5, which strongly recalls the Russo-English trade over Archangel; further,

 trade in Sardinia and Africa, it was in 306 entirely denied them.</p>

 Commercial treaty of the Venetians with the Latin empire in
 Constantinople, of the Genoese with the Greek after its restoration; in
 which, for instance, it was promised to the former, that no citizen of a
 state at war with Venice, should be permitted to sojourn in the Byzantine
 empire; to the latter, that they alone of all foreigners should enjoy
 freedom from taxation, and, with the Pisans, navigate the Black Sea. As
 long as the Dutch were the hereditary foes of Spain, they were much
 favored in France. Commercial treaty of 1596, putting them on an equal
 footing with the French; and which, considering their superiority at the
 time, was necessarily of greater advantage to them than to the French.
 <i>Colbert's</i> step to destroy this preponderance is coincident with the
 changed foreign policy. (Richesse de Hollande, I, 127.) In the peace of
 Nijmegen,<a id="fnanchor_TN130"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN130">[TN 130]</a> again (art. 6 seq.),
 France tried to separate the Dutch from their allies by the restoration of
 their former rights. In the Spanish war of succession, France entered into
 a treaty with the arch-duke, Charles, that a common commission should fix
 the duties on English commodities, transfer the trade with America to an
 English-Spanish company, but that the French should be excluded therefrom.

 The Methuen treaty (1703) was considered an English master-piece, because
 Portugal had actually exported a great deal of Brazilian gold to England.
 <i>Pombal</i> said, in 1759: "Through unexampled stupidity, we permit
 ourselves to be clothed, etc. England robs us every year, by its industry,
 of the products of our mines.... A severe prohibition of the exportation
 of gold from Portugal might overthrow England." (<i>Schäfer</i>, Portug.
 Gesch., V, 494 ff.) And yet the treaty only says that Portugal withdraws
 its prohibition of English woolen wares, and restores the former duties
 (15 per cent.), while England continues to permit Portuguese wine to pay a
 duty 1/3 less than French wines! Singular doctrine of <i>Adam Smith</i>
 (W. of N., IV, ch. 6), and still more of <i>McCulloch</i> (Comm. Dict., v.
 Commercial Treaties), that this commercial treaty was unfavorable to
 England and very favorable to Portugal, although, in fact, later a duty of
 only about 3 per cent. was imposed here on English commodities.
 (<i>Büsch</i>, Werke, II, 62.) The English-French commercial treaty of
 1786 introduces in the place of the former prohibition, duties of 10, 12
 and 15 per cent. for a number of industrial products. The French soon came
 to believe that they had been taken advantage of here. <i>A. Young</i>
 found the desire very general in the north of France, to get rid of the
 Eden treaty even through a war. (Travels in France, I, 73.) Many of the
 <i>cahiers</i> of the third estate demand that no treaty of commerce
 should be entered into without previous consultation with the industries
 interested. (Acad. des Sc. morales et polit., 1865, III, 214.) But in
 England, also, bitter complaints of the opposition, to which Pitt replied,
 that commercial treaties between agricultural and industrial countries
 result to the advantage of the latter, independent of the fact that
 England obtained a new market of 24,000,000, and France of only 8,000,000
 persons. Compare the extracts in <i>Lauderdale</i>, Inquiry, App., 14.

 Seldom in antiquity. Compare, however, Inscr. Gr., II, No. 256, and the
 reciprocal granting of the rights of citizenship of Athens and Rhodes.
 (<i>Livy</i>, XXXI, 15.) Among the moderns, Flanders followed free-trade
 principles similar to those followed later by Holland, at the beginning of
 the fourteenth century; for instance, it refused to gratify France by
 breaking off its trade with Scotland. (<i>Rymer</i>, Foedera, II, 388.)
 Florence, in 1490, promised the English, that in all treaties to be
 entered into with others, it would permit it to enter. In the
 French-Florentine commercial treaty of 1494, it is stipulated with the
 Florentines that their ships <i>Gallica esse intelligantur</i> and their
 merchants <i>tanquam veri et naturales Galli</i> etc. (Decima, II, 308.)
 Swedish treaty with Stralsund, 1574, that every privilege granted to a
 Baltic city should also be, of itself, to the advantage of Stralsund.
 Mutual equal treatment of subjects promised between Portugal and England,
 1642; Portugal and Holland, 1661; mutual treatment on the basis of the
 most favored nation: between England and Portugal, 1642; Holland and
 Spain, in the peace of Utrecht; Spain and Portugal, 1713; Spain and
 Tuscany, 1731; England and Russia, 1734. But how far such principles were
 removed from the beginning of the eighteenth century is shown by the
 speech from the throne of the 28th of January, 1727, of George I., in
 which the Austro-Spanish treaty of 1725, that placed the subjects of
 Austria in the colonial empire of Spain on an equal footing with the
 English and Dutch, is described as a violation of the dearest interests of
 England, and in which it is said that England must defend its own
 unquestionable right against the covenant entered into to violate public
 faith and the most solemn treaties; that it might be that Spain thought of
 subjecting England once more to the popish pretender. Even in 1713, it was
 one of the principal points in controversy between the Tories and Whigs,
 whether, in a commercial treaty with France, the latter should be accorded
 the rights of the most favored nations. Compare <i>Daniel Defoe</i>, A
 Plan of the English Commerce, and <i>per contra</i>, The British

 instance, France granted the right of coast-sailing proper

 navigation qu'ils accorderaient à un autre état gratuitement ou avec

<a href="#fnanchor_A2-6-13" class="pginternal">[A2-6-13]</a>
 Napoleon III. had a preference for commercial treaties, because these, as
 acts of foreign politics, lay in the plenitude of his imperial power (art.
 6 of the constitution of 1852; senatus consultum of Dec. 23, 1852), while
 in legislation, his free trade tendencies were limited by popular
 representation. And so also Prussia, by its commercial treaty with him
 (1862), was actually freed from the hindrances which the free veto of the
 Zollverein-conferences would have opposed to its reform. Opposition to the
 treaty-form because too binding. (<i>Chaptal</i>, De l'Industrie
 Française, II, 242 ff.) The free-trade party lauds it precisely on this
 account. See the report of the Leipzig Chamber of Commerce for 1874-75, p.

TRADE.</h3>
<p class="p2 center">SECTION I.</p>
<p class="center smaller">PROXIMATE ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF THE INDUSTRIAL
PROTECTIVE SYSTEM.</p>
<p>That the principal measures which the mercantile system recommended,
artificially to increase a nation's wealth, could not produce the immediate
effects expected of them, has been shown, especially from the natural
history of money. Their proximate economic consequences necessarily
consisted in this, that they diverted the existing productive forces of the
nation from their places of application (<i>Verwendungsplätzen</i>)
hitherto, to others which the government thought more advantageous.</p>
<p>A. If home producers are in a condition to offer their commodities as
good and as cheap as foreigners, all protection of the former by import
duties, or even by prohibitions, is superfluous. The home producer has, as
a rule, not only the advantage of the smaller cost of freight to the place
of consumption,<a id="fnanchor_A3-1-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A3-1-1">[A3-1-1]</a> but that of being
earlier informed, because of his <span class="pagenum">[Pg 424]</span>
proximity to consumers, of a change in their tastes.<a id="fnanchor_A3-1-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A3-1-2">[A3-1-2]</a> If, indeed, foreigners could supply us
better and cheaper, and if they are kept from supplying our market only by
artificial means, the state compels our consumers to a sacrifice of
enjoyment;<a id="fnanchor_A3-1-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A3-1-3">[A3-1-3]</a> and such a sacrifice as is
not fully compensated for by the profit made by the favored producers in
any manner. The latter are generally soon compelled by home competition to
arrange their prices in accordance with the rate of profit usual in the
country. If they had no "protection" they would simply employ their
productive forces in other branches of production; and in those in which
they were equal or even superior to foreign competitors. By means of the
products thus obtained, the people might then get in exchange all those

 It is of course different in the working (<i>Verarbeitung</i>) of foreign
 raw material. Much also depends on the situation of the industrial
 provinces. For instance, manufactured articles can reach the interior of
 Spain and the Western states of the American Union only after they have
 passed the industrial coast-regions of both countries. In Russia, on the
 other hand, the center is the principal industrial region; and hence the
 coast may be actually nearer to foreign than to home manufacturers.
 Similarly, in France, at least for iron and coal. Compare <i>Adam
 Smith</i>, W. of N., II, p. 279 Bas.</p>

 People would, however, have to calculate on the foolish luxury which
 despises the home product because "it came from no great distance."
 World-supremacy of Paris fashions! A manufacturer of excellent German
 <i>Schaumwein</i> (foaming wine) complained to me, in 1861, that, after
 suffering heavy losses, he was compelled by his customers to adopt French
 labels. Here, a wise prince may have a favorable influence by his example.
 Louis XIV. himself insisted, when his mother died, that the court should
 use only French articles of mourning. <i>Gee</i>, Trade and Navigation, p.
 46. Augustus I., of Saxony, always wore home cloth. (<i>Weisse</i>, Museum
 für Sächsische Geschichte, II, 2, 109.) Similar requirements by the prince
 of Orange (1749) of all officials: Richesse de Hollande, II, 317. Dutch
 executioners were dressed in calico. (Discourse of Trade, Coyn, etc.,
 1697.) American popular stipulations not to wear foreign articles of
 luxury. (<i>Ebeling</i>, Geschichte und Erdbeschreibung, II, 481.) Rhode
 Island tailors placed the working wages for home stuffs much lower than
 for foreign. (II, 149.)</p>

<i>Prince Smith</i> calls protective duties scarcity-duties
 (<i>Theuerungszölle</i>). Because of this increased dearness of the
 "protected" commodities, consumers can no longer pay for as many other
 home commodities. If the industry was previously in existence, the
 protective duty imposed is wont to enhance the price, not only of the
 foreign commodity, but also of the home commodity.</p>

 If, for instance, the English had never had a protective tariff on silk,
 nor the French a protective tariff on iron, the former would probably get
 all the silk commodities they want from France and pay for them in iron
 ware. In this way, both nations would be well off in what concerns the
 relation between the cost of production and the satisfaction of wants.
 <i>Say</i> calls protective duties a fight against nature, in which we
 take pains to refuse a part of the gifts which nature offers us. He leaves
 himself open to the charge of exaggeration, however, when he compares a
 nation that wants to produce everything itself to a shoemaker who wanted
 to be tailor, carpenter, to build houses and cultivate a farm also.
 Although no nation is all-sided, yet every nation is a great deal

 Whoever keeps a people from purchasing in the cheapest market, thereby
 prevents their selling in the dearest. (<i>McCulloch.</i>) It was no mere
 desire of revenge that induced Holland, in the 17th century, to threaten
 the Poles, in case the enhancement of their duties continued in Danzig and
 Pillau, they would supply their corn-want from Russia, (<i>Boxhorn</i>,
 Varii Tractat. polit., p. 240.) Thus the tariff-measures adopted by France
 against the German cattle trade and the Swedish iron trade promoted the
 growth of the Crefeld silk manufacture, and lessened the exportation of
 French wine to Sweden. When, in 1809, England heavily taxed Norwegian
 wood, in favor of Canada, the Norwegians began, instead of purchasing
 English manufactured articles, to supply themselves from Hamburg, Altona
 and France. (<i>Blom</i>, Norwegen, I, 257.)</p>

<i>Fr. List</i> assumed altogether too unconditionally such an effect from
 import duties to be the rule. The more developed the self-confidence of a
 nation is, the more vigorous the life of its industries, the more
 many-sided the commerce of its people; the less disposed are its
 industrial classes to give up their home and carry their market with them.
 But, for instance, Swiss labor and, still more, Swiss capital have been
 induced by the tariff-systems of the great neighboring countries to settle
 in Mühlhausen, Baden and Voralberg, or at least to establish branch houses
 in these places. Similarly, Neumark cloth makers were induced to emigrate
 to Russia, and Nürnberg industrial workmen to Austria (<i>Roth</i>,
 Geschichte des Nürnbergen Handels, II, 170) etc. Compare <i>Burkhardt</i>,

 Compare <i>Alby</i> in the Revue des deux Mondes, Oct., 1869, and, <i>per

 internal disquiet have frequently driven away the best labor-forces of an
 old industrial state, and thus powerfully promoted a young protective
 system in the neighborhood. Reception of Byzantine silk-weavers in Venice,

<p class="footnote">England, indeed, had, up to 1849, protective duties
 both for industry and agriculture. But the protective duties were of no
 real importance, except in the case of the latter, because the greater
 part of England's industrial products were superior to foreign competition
 without the help of protective duties. Something similar is true of most
 duties on raw material in the United States.</p>

<p class="center smaller">EFFECT OF EXPORT DUTIES, etc., ON RAW MATERIAL.—EXPORT
PREMIUMS.</p>
<p>B. Export duties on raw material, and prohibitions of the exportation of
raw material, lower the price of such articles, by preventing the
competition of foreign buyers.<a id="fnanchor_A3-2-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A3-2-1">[A3-2-1]</a> To this loss of the producers of raw material,
there is, in the long run, no corresponding gain to the manufacturers.
Rather will there be, when freedom of competition prevails at home, an
increased flow of the forces of production to the favored branch, because
of its rate of profit, which is greater than that usual in the country, and
a corresponding flow from the injured branch, until such time as the level
of profit usual <span class="pagenum">[Pg 427]</span> in the country is
restored.<a id="fnanchor_A3-2-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A3-2-2">[A3-2-2]</a> Hence here, also, the
final result is only a change of the direction, not a direct increase of

<p>C. In the case of export-premiums, it is necessary to distinguish
between the mere refunding back of the taxes which have been paid on the
assumption of a home consumption which has not taken place (drawbacks), and
the actual making of donations because of the exportation of goods
(bounties). The former produces no result except to maintain the
possibility of a production which would otherwise have been prevented by
the tax. The latter, on the contrary, compels all <span class="pagenum">[Pg
428]</span> those who are subject to taxation to make a donation to one
particular class of persons engaged in industry.<a id="fnanchor_A3-2-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A3-2-4">[A3-2-4]</a> Moreover, all consumers are compelled to pay a
higher price for the commodity to the extent that the market price,
inclusive of the premium to be obtained abroad, is higher than the home
market price hitherto usual. But, as the cost of production has not
increased, this profit of the producers, which is greater than that usual
in the country, must induce other productive forces to enter into the
favored branch; so that here, also, the lasting result is not a higher rate
of profit of the individuals engaged in the industry, but an extension of
the industry itself. Foreign countries chiefly reap the greatest advantage
from this course, since they obtain the commodities at gift-prices.<a id="fnanchor_A3-2-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A3-2-5">[A3-2-5]</a> The premiums paid, not for exportation, but
for the production of a commodity, have a meaning akin to this.<a id="fnanchor_A3-2-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A3-2-6">[A3-2-6]</a> Either the industry could not maintain itself
without premiums, in which case the state encourages a losing
production,—and the more there is produced the greater is the loss to
the national economy;—or the industry might exist without the payment
of premiums, and then the newly increased profit <span class="pagenum">[Pg

follow, and all the effects of export-premiums appear.<a id="fnanchor_A3-2-7"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A3-2-7">[A3-2-7]</a></p>

 Rags in Silesia dearer than in Bohemia by the full amount of the Austrian
 export duties (Gutachten über die Erneuerung der Handelsverträge; 1876, p.
 9). When the English export-prohibitions were extended to Scotland, the
 price of Scotch wool fell about 50 per cent. (<i>A. Smith</i>, W. of N.,
 IV, ch. 8.) In the case of foreign raw material, the reëxportation of
 which is prevented, the object of such prohibitions may be largely
 frustrated. When England, to promote its dyeing industries, left the
 importation of colors entirely free, but allowed their exportation only
 under heavy duties (8 George I., c. 15), the importers provided the market
 always with somewhat less than the amount required, and thus raised the
 price.</p>

 Export hindrances have been continued longest in favor of manufacturing
 industries (<i>Verarbeitungsindustrie</i>), in the case of such
 commodities as are not intentionally produced, such as rags, ashes, etc.,
 but which are collected only as the remains of some other kind of
 production or consumption. "Negative production," according to
 <i>Stilling</i>, Grundsätze der Staatswirthschaft, 803, because it is
 desirable to produce as little as possible of such raw material. But the
 dearer rags, for instance, are, the more carefully are they collected.</p>

 When the French prohibition of the exportation of hemp was extended to
 Alsace, its production decreased from 60,000 to 40,000 cwt.
 (<i>Schwerz</i>, Landwirthschaft des Nieder-Elsasses, 378 ff.) Frederick
 the Great soon carried his prohibition of the exportation of raw wool to
 such an extent as to prohibit the exportation even of unshorn sheep, and
 to punish the dropping of a sheepfold by a fine of 1,000 ducats. (Preuss.
 Gesch. Friedrichs III., 42.) Here, also, belong prohibitions relating to
 the exportation of corn, which force considerable capital, etc. into
 industry. The prohibition of the exportation of corn in England, and the
 permitting of the exportation of cattle, wool, etc., was one of the
 principal causes why there were so many complaints at the time of the
 turning of land used for tillage into pasturage-land. When, in 1666, the
 exportation of Irish cattle to England was prohibited, it produced, at the
 outset, great need in Ireland, but afterwards a flourishing condition of
 Irish industry. (<i>Hume</i>, History of England, ch. 64.)</p>

 As to how, by means of German drawbacks (<i>Rückzölle</i>) it is possible
 for beet-sugar to be offered at a cheaper rate in Brazil than home
 cane-sugar, see <i>Wappäus</i>, Brazilien, 1830. The French
 export-premiums for sugar amounted, in 1856, to over 8,000,000 francs.
 Frenchmen subject to taxation were obliged to pay this amount, and thus
 add to the already increasing price which they had to pay for that
 article. (Journ. des Econom., Juill., 1857.) In England, in 1742, the
 export-premiums for linen were defrayed by enhanced entry-duties on
 cambrics. (15 and 16 George II., c. 29.)</p>

<p>From what has been said, we may understand why the so-called free-trade

rejects all those measures of the industrial protective system.<a id="fnanchor_A3-3-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A3-3-1">[A3-3-1]</a> As such measures really injure <span class="pagenum">[Pg 430]</span> the oppressed portions of the people more than
they help the favored classes, their introduction, it is said, uniformly
depends on this, that single classes of producers understand their private
interests better than others, and are better organized than other producers
and especially better than consumers, to take care of their interests.<a id="fnanchor_A3-3-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A3-3-2">[A3-3-2]</a> Adam Smith approves import hindrances for the
purpose of artificially promoting an industry only in two cases:</p>
<p>A. When military safety demands it. Hence he calls the English
navigation act, that great prohibitive and protective law intended to
advance the merchant marine, the wisest perhaps of all English commercial
regulations, although he clearly saw that it compelled England to sell her
own commodities cheaper and buy foreign commodities dearer.<a id="fnanchor_A3-3-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A3-3-3">[A3-3-3]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 431]</span>B. When the import duty is no more
than sufficient to balance the tax imposed on the corresponding home
product. Smith rightly remarks that a universally heavier taxation by the
home country, but which affected all branches of its production equally,
operated like diminished natural fertility, and hence does not make any
equalizing tax for foreign trade necessary.</p>
<p>The person who has only a modest opinion of the power of his own reason,
and therefore a just one of the reason of other men and other times, will
not believe that a system like the industrial protective system which the
greatest theorizers and practitioners favored for centuries, and which
governed all highly developed countries in certain periods of their
national life, proceeded entirely from error and deception. It really
served, in its own time, a great and regularly occurring want; and the
error consisted only in this, that, partly through improper generalization
by doctrinarians and partly by the avarice of the privileged classes and
the inertia of statesmen, the conditioned and transitory was looked upon as
something absolute.<a id="fnanchor_A3-3-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A3-3-4">[A3-3-4]</a></p>

<i>P. de la Court</i>, in his freedom of trade, has in view not the
 interest of consumers—and least of all of the whole world—but
 the interest of the commercial class. Compare Tüb. Ztschr., 1862, p. 273.
 Similarly, <i>Child</i>, Discourse of Trade, 1690; whereas <i>D.
 North</i>, Discourses upon Trade (1690), may be called a free-trader in
 the sense in which the expression is used to-day. No nation has yet grown
 rich by state-measures; but peace, thrift and freedom, and nothing else,
 procure wealth. (Postscr.) <i>Davenant</i> also zealously opposes the
 craving of a people to produce everything themselves, to want only to
 sell, etc. He considered very few laws on commerce a sign of a flourishing
 condition of trade. (Works, I, 99, 104 ff.; V, 379 ff., 387 seq.)
 <i>Fénélon's</i> antipathy for import and export duties in Telémaque, a
 part of his general opposition to the <i>siècle de Louis XIV</i>. The view
 of the Physiocrates (<i>La police du commerce interiéur et extérieur la
 plus sure, la plus exacte, la plus profitable à la nation et à l'état
 consiste dans la pleine liberté de la concurrence</i>: <i>Quesnay</i>,
 Maximes générales, No. 25) is directly connected with their deepest
 fundamental notions of <i>produit net</i> and <i>impôt unique</i>.
 <i>Turgot</i> vindicates the interests of workmen against protective
 duties, for whom no compensation is possible, where one industry gains by
 its being favored in the same way that it loses when another is favored.
 (Sur la Marque de Fer, I, p. 376 ff., Daire.) "Those who cry so loudly for
 protective duties are partly thoughtless persons who wish to avoid the
 consequences of bad speculations, and in part shrewd persons who would
 like to earn during the first years a rate of profit higher than that
 usual in the country." (<i>Rossi.</i>) <i>Bastiat</i> ridicules the
 advocates of a protective tariff by the petition of the lamplighters, lamp
 manufacturers, etc., that to advance their industry, and indirectly almost
 all others, the mighty foreign competition of the sun might be removed
 from all houses. (Sophismes écon., ch. 7.) To him, the protective system
 is precisely the system of want; freedom of trade, the system of
 superabundance. Political economy would have fulfilled its practical
 calling, if, by means of universal freedom of trade, it had done away with
 all that is left of that system which excludes foreign commodities because
 they are cheap, that is, because they include <i>une grande proportion
 d'utilité gratuite</i>. (Harmonies, p. 174, 306.) <i>Cobden's</i> pet
 expression: "Free trade, the international law of the Almighty!" (Polit.
 Writings, II, 110.) <i>K. S. Zachariä</i> calls the protective system a
 step introductory to communism (Staatsw. Abh., 100), because it nearly
 always leads to over-population and <i>List's</i> system, a
 politico-economical absurdity. (Vierzig Bücher vom Staate, VII, pp. 23,

 Among the many frequently wonderful speeches by which persons engaged in
 industry are wont to support their motion for protective duties, etc., the
 following are particularly characteristic. The long struggle of English
 manufactures against the East Indian Company, since the later portion of
 the seventeenth century. Compare <i>Pollexfen</i>, England and East India
 inconsistent in their Manufactures (1697), against which <i>Davenant</i>,
 at the solicitation of the company, wrote his Essay on the E. I. Trade
 (1697). Prohibition of East Indian commodities, 11 and 12 Will. III., ch.
 10. The struggle did not stop until the middle of the eighteenth century,
 when India was outflanked by English machines. When Pitt, in 1785, labored
 for the abolition of the tariff-barriers against Ireland, English
 manufacturers, and among others Robert Peel, declared that they would be
 forced in consequence to transfer a part of their manufactories to
 Ireland! (<i>McCulloch</i>, Literature of Political Economy, p. 55.)

 prohibit foreign straw hats (1. c).</p>

 W. of N., IV, ch. 2. According to <i>Roger Coke</i>, England's Improvement
 (1675), ship-building in England became dearer in a few years by about
 one-third, on account of the navigation act; and the wages of sailors
 advanced to such an extent that England lost its Russian and Greenland
 trade almost entirely, and the Dutch obtained the control of it. This
 <i>J. Child</i>, Discourse of Trade, admits, but still calls the
 navigation act the <i>magna charta maritima</i>. Similarly,
 <i>Davenant</i>, Works, I, 397. Here the relation of the cost to the
 immediate product can as little decide as it can against the exercise of
 troops or the construction of forts. <i>Adam Smith</i> allows the same
 reasons to apply to export premiums for sail-cloth and gunpowder (IV, ch.
 5). Recently, however, <i>Bülau</i> (Staatswirthschaftlehre, 339; Staat

<p>The sacrifices which the protective system directly imposes on the

(<i>Anstrengung</i>) of the productive forces of the country, are produced
and enjoyed, than free trade would procure. But it is possible by its means
to build up (<i>bilden</i>) new productive forces, to awaken slumbering

 a year. The one brings his sons up as tillers of the ground (<i>Bauern</i>
 = peasants) and puts his savings out at interest. The other, on the
 contrary, has two of his sons educated as <i>rational</i>
 (<i>rationelle</i>) agriculturists, and the others as intelligent
 industrial workers, and at a cost which prevents the possibility of his
 accumulating any more capital. Which of the two has cared better for the
 standing, wealth, etc. of his posterity; the adherent of the "theory of
 exchangeable values" or the adherent of the doctrine of "the productive
 forces?"</p>

 Blind free-traders always like to assume that every man capable of working
 always busies himself; whereas idleness frequently excuses the wasting of
 its time, by the plea that a remunerative market of the possible new
 products is improbable, or at least uncertain. Compare <i>J. Möser</i>, P.
 Ph., I, 4. <i>Kröncke</i>, Steuerwesen (1804), 324, 328 seq., and even the

 Let us suppose that a country had hitherto produced $10,000,000 worth of
 corn, and that of this amount it had sent $1,000,000 worth into foreign
 countries as a counter-value for foreign manufactured articles. It now, by
 means of a protective tariff, establishes home manufactures, through the
 instrumentality of which a coal bed or water fall is turned to account.
 The workmen in the manufactories henceforth consume what was formerly
 exported. Of course such a change is not effected without loss; but this
 loss ceases as soon as the home industry becomes the equal of the foreign
 industry which was crowded out. And then the forces which have been made
 useful in the meantime appear as clear gain. <i>List</i> not unfrequently
 called special attention to the fact that a consumption of 70,000 persons
 engaged in home industries means as much to German agriculture as all that
 it exported to England from 1833 to 1836. (Zollvereinsblatt, 1843, No.
 5.)</p>

<a href="#fnanchor_A3-4-7" class="pginternal">[A3-4-7]</a>
<i>Adam Smith's</i> free-trade doctrine has always been contradicted in
 Germany. Even in 1777, his first great reviewer, <i>Feder</i>, says that
 many foreign commodities can be dispensed with without damage; and that
 industries which indemnify the undertakers of them only after a time but
 which are then very useful to the community in general, would not be begun
 always without special favor shown them. (<i>Roscher</i>, Geschichte der
 National Oekonomie, II, p. 599.) <i>Kröncke</i>, Steuerwesen, 324 ff.,
 speaks of attempts towards the education of industries by taxation-favors:
 "If of ten, only one succeeds, even that is to be considered a great
 gain." But modern protectionists base themselves chiefly on their interest
 in the independence of the country, precisely as the free-traders do on
 that of individual freedom. <i>Ad. Müller</i>, with his organic way of
 comprehending things, opposes the assumption of a merely mercantile
 world-market, in which all the merchants engaged in foreign trade
 constitute a species of republic. (<i>Quesnay.</i>) He also rejects on
 national grounds the universal freedom of trade as well as the universal
 empire akin to it; although as a means of opposing it, he suggests not so
 much a protective tariff as the intellectual cultivation of nationality in
 general. (Elemente der Staatskunst, 1809, II, 290, III, 215, II, 240,
 258.) According to <i>Sörgel</i> (Memorial an den Kurfürst v. Sachsen,
 1801,) commercial constraint (<i>Handelszwang</i>), by means of export and
 import duties, is useful in the childhood of manufactures, afterwards
 injurious, because the powerful incentive to perfection is wanting where
 no competition is to be feared (67). <i>P. Kaufmann</i>, the opponent of
 Smith's balance-theory, demands moderate protection against the otherwise
 irresistible advantages to already developed industrial nations.
 (Untersuchungen, 1829, I, 98 ff.) The principal advocate in this direction
 is <i>Fr. List</i>, with a great deal of sense for the historical, but
 with little historical erudition; and after the manner of an intelligent
 journalist, he reproaches the free-trade school with baseless
 cosmopolitanism, deadly materialism, and disorganizing individualism. He
 distinguishes in the development of nations five different stages:
 hunter-life, shepherd-life, agriculture, the agricultural-manufacturing
 period, the agricultural-manufacturing-commercial period; and he demands
 that the state should lend its assistance in the transition from the third
 to the fourth stage, in the nursing or planting of manufacturing forces in
 connection, throughout, with the enfeebling of feudalism and bureaucracy,
 the increase of the middle class, with the power of public opinion,
 especially of the press, the strengthening of the national consciousness
 from within and without. Compare <i>Roscher's</i> review in the Gött.
 gelehrten A. 1842, No. 118 ff. As to how List resembles, and differs from
 Ad. Müller, see <i>Roscher</i>, Gesch. der N. O., II, 975 ff.; <i>von
 Thünen's</i> independent defense of a protective tariff; Isolirter Staat,
 II, 2, 81, 92 ff., 98; Leben, p. 255 seq. The socialist <i>Marlo</i>
 (Weltökonomie, I, ch. 9, 10) distinguishes common products
 (<i>Gemeinprodukte</i>) which may be obtained equally well in every
 properly developed country, and peculiar products (<i>Sonderprodukte</i>),
 like coffee, wine, etc. With respect to the former, he agrees with List;
 in regard to the latter, with Smith. A protective tariff exerts a
 constraint on consumers, compelling them to abridge their enjoyments
 somewhat, and to employ these now in the procuring of instruments of
 production, in the exercise of skill needed in production and the
 accumulation of capital. At the same time foreigners should be kept from
 utilizing home natural forces, and where possible, home manufactures
 should be helped to utilize foreign natural forces. <i>Marlo</i>, indeed,
 assumes, as one-sidedly as the followers of Smith do the contrary, that
 without the tariff the workmen in question would not be employed at all;
 but he is right in this, that the most fruitful employment of the forces
 of labor, and the keeping of them most completely busy, mutually replace
 each other. In France, even <i>Ferrier</i>, Du Gouvernement considéré dans
 ses Rapports avec le Commerce (1808), had defended the Napoleonic
 continental system. See <i>Ganilh</i>, the French List, Theorie de
 l'Economie politique (1822), who grades the branches of a nation's economy
 in a way the reverse of Adam Smith, and finds the protective system
 necessary for the less developed nations, to the end that they may not be
 confined to the most disadvantageous employments of capital (II, p. 192
 ff.). Especially is a greater population made possible in this way (248
 ff.). Similarly, <i>Suzanne</i>, Principes de l'E. polit., 1826. Further,
 <i>H. Richelot</i>, List's translator. <i>M. Chevalier</i>, who recommends
 free trade for France in our day so strongly, approves the system of
 Cromwell and Colbert for their own time, and for a long time afterwards
 (Examen du Système commercial, 1851, ch. 7): a view which <i>Périn</i>
 says is now shared by "all serious writers." (Richesse dans les Sociétés
 Chrétiennes, 1861, I, p. 510.) <i>Demesnil-Marigny</i>, Les libres
 Échangistes et les Protectionistes conciliés (1860), bases his protective
 system on this, chiefly, that it may greatly enhance the money-value of a
 nation's resources to the detriment of other nations, especially by the
 transformation of agricultural labor, estimated in money, into the much
 more productive labor of industry. The value in use of all the national
 resources<a id="fnanchor_TN131"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN131">[TN 131]</a> is doubtless greatest
 where full freedom of trade obtains. In Russia, <i>Cancrin</i> demands
 that every nation should be to some extent independent in respect to all
 the chief wants to the production of which it has at least a middle
 (<i>mittlere</i>) opportunity; especially as all civilization, even the
 higher development of agriculture, must proceed from the cities.
 (Weltreichthum, 1821, 109 ff. Oekonomie der menschlichen Gesellschaften,
 1845, 10, 235 ff.) America's most distinguished protectionist is
 <i>Hamilton</i>, Report on the Subject of Manufactures presented to the
 House of Representatives, December 5, 1791. <i>Jefferson's</i> saying,
 that the industry should settle by the side of agriculture, leads us to
 <i>Carey</i>, who repeats the same idea with wearying unwearisomeness; at
 first for the reason that the "machine of exchange" should not be allowed
 to become too costly; but afterwards rather from the Liebig endeavor to
 prevent the exhaustion of the soil. He describes, indeed, how the East
 Indian producer and consumer of cotton are united with one another by a
 pontoon bridge which leads over England. (Principles of Social Science, I,
 378.) A good soil and good harbors are the greatest misfortune for a
 country like Carolina if free trade prevails, because it is turned into an
 agricultural country (I, 373). The people who, after the manner of the
 Irish, gradually export their soil, will end by exporting themselves.
 <i>Carey</i> would force colonies to demean themselves like old countries
 from the first. If corn be worth 25 cents in Iowa, and in Liverpool $1,
 for which 20 ells of calico are brought back, the Iowa farmer receives of
 this quantity about 4 ells. Hence it would be no injury to him were he to
 supply his want of cotton from a neighbor who produced it at a cost four
 times as great as the Englishmen. Analogies drawn from natural history,
 as, for instance, that every organism, the lower it is in the scale of
 existence, the greater is the homogeneity of its several parts; also a
 deep aversion for centralization, and hatred of England, coöperate in
 <i>Carey's</i> recommendation of the protective system, often called in
 the United States the "American system," in opposition to the "British,"
 advocated by Webster against Calhoun and Clay against Jackson. <i>John
 Stuart Mill</i>, Principles, V, ch. 10, 1, allows a protective tariff
 temporarily, "in hopes of naturalizing a foreign industry in itself
 perfectly suitable to the circumstances of the country." Peel's colleague,
 G. Smythe, said, in 1847, at Canterbury, that as an American (citizen of a
 young country) or as a Frenchman (citizen of an old country with its
 industry undeveloped), he would be a protectionist. (Colton, Public
 Economy, p. 81.) Even <i>Huskisson</i> admitted, in 1826, that England in
 the seventeenth century had been very much advanced by its protective
 system; and that he would continue to vote even now for its maintenance,
 if there were no reprisals to fear.</p>
<p class="p2 center">SECTION V.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 434]</span></p>
<p class="center smaller">PROTECTION AS A POLICY.</p>
<p>A. So long as a nation is, indeed, politically independent, but
economically in a very low stage, it is best served by entire freedom of
trade with the outside world; because such freedom causes the influences of
the incentives, wants, and the means of satisfaction of a higher
civilization to be soonest felt in the country.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 435]</span>B. The further advance which
consists in the development of home industries by the country itself, may,
indeed, be rendered exceedingly difficult by the unrestricted competition
of foreign industries, which are already developed. The carriers <span class="pagenum">[Pg 436]</span> on of industry in an old industrial country
have a superiority over those in the new, in the amount of capital, the
lowness of the rate of interest, the skill of undertakers
(<i>Unternehmer</i>) and workmen, generally, also in the consideration in
which the whole country hold industry, and the interest they take in it;<a id="fnanchor_A3-5-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A3-5-1">[A3-5-1]</a> while in the country which has hitherto been
merely agricultural, it happens only too frequently that industry is
undervalued, <span class="pagenum">[Pg 437]</span> and that young
industrial talent is, as a consequence, forced to emigrate. How frequently
it has happened that England by keeping down her prices for a time has
strangled her foreign rivals.<a id="fnanchor_A3-5-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A3-5-2">[A3-5-2]</a> Even on the supposition of equal natural capacity,
the struggle between the two industries would come to a close similar to
that between a boy of buoyant spirits and an athletically developed man.
What then is to be said of the cases in which the more highly developed
nation is at the same time possessed of the more favorable natural
advantages, such, for instance, as England possesses over Russia in her
incomparable situation in relation to the trade of the world, and which
gives her for all distant countries, without any active commerce, a
monopoly-like advantage; farther, her magnificent harbors, streams, her
well-situated wealth in iron and coal, etc. The advantages of mere priority
weigh most heavily, when the great development of all means of
transportation almost does away with the natural protection afforded by
remoteness; and when, at the same time, a certain universality of fashion,
which, as a rule, is governed by the most highly developed nations, causes
national and local differences of taste, which could be satisfied only by
national or local production, to become obsolete.<a id="fnanchor_A3-5-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A3-5-3">[A3-5-3]</a> Under such circumstances, it would be possible,
that a whole nation might be <span class="pagenum">[Pg 438]</span> made
continually to act the part of an agricultural district (<i>plattes
Land</i>), to one earlier developed, leaving to the latter, almost
exclusively, the life of the city and of industry.<a id="fnanchor_A3-5-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A3-5-4">[A3-5-4]</a> A wisely conducted protective system might act as a
preventive against this evil, the temporary sacrifices which such a system
necessitates being justifiable where some of the factors of industrial
production unquestionably exist but remain unused, because others, on
account of the mere posteriority of the nation, cannot be built up. The
abusive term "hot-house plant" should not be used where there is question
only of transitory protection, and where there is the full intention to
surrender the grown tree to all the wind, rain and sunshine of free
competition, and where it is foreseen that it shall be so surrendered.<a id="fnanchor_A3-5-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A3-5-5">[A3-5-5]</a> <a id="fnanchor_A3-5-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A3-5-6">[A3-5-6]</a> The want of a certain economic many-sidedness which
must <span class="pagenum">[Pg 439]</span> be given to a nation manifests
itself in a particularly urgent manner in times of protracted war. Here the
error of so many free-traders, that different states should comport
themselves towards one another as the different provinces of the same state
do, is most clearly refuted.<a id="fnanchor_A3-5-7"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A3-5-7">[A3-5-7]</a></p>
<p>C. No less important is the political side of the question. Since the
protective system forces capital and labor away from the production of raw
material and into industry, it exerts a great influence on the relations of
the classes or estates of a country to one another. The immense
preponderance possessed in medieval times by the nobility, agriculture, the
country in general as contradistinguished from the city, by the
aristocratic and conservative elements, is curtailed in favor of the
bourgeoisie, of industry, of the cities generally, and of the democratic
and progressive elements. If when the history of a nation is at its highest
point, there is supposed a certain equilibrium of the different elements,
all of which are equally necessary to the prime of a nation's life, this
height is now attained sooner than it would otherwise be. It is no mere
accident that in almost every instance, those monarchs who humbled the
medieval nobility and introduced the modern era, also established a
protective system.<a id="fnanchor_A3-5-8"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A3-5-8">[A3-5-8]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 440]</span>D. However, such an education of
industry can be attempted with proper success only on a large scale, that
is, on a national basis. The least hazardous (<i>unbedenklich</i>) measure
of the system, import-duties supposes a relatively short boundary line,
such as only a great country, even where its formation is the most
favorable imaginable, can possess.<a id="fnanchor_A3-5-9"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A3-5-9">[A3-5-9]</a> The greater the tariff territory
(<i>Zollgebiet</i>), the less one-sided is its natural capacity wont to be,
the sooner may an active competition in its interior be built up, while the
foreign market always suffers from uncertainty. Hence all tariff-unions
(<i>Zollverein</i>) between related states are to be recommended not only
as financially but also as economically advantageous. Between states not
related and of equal power, so far-reaching a reciprocity, embracing nearly
the whole of economic policy, can scarcely be established; and it would be
still harder for it to continue long. If the states not related are of very
unequal power, the probable consequence would be the early absorption of
the weaker by the stronger.<a id="fnanchor_A3-5-10"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A3-5-10">[A3-5-10]</a> <a id="fnanchor_A3-5-11"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A3-5-11">[A3-5-11]</a></p>

<a href="#fnanchor_A3-5-2" class="pginternal">[A3-5-2]</a>
<i>Hume</i>, in the parliamentary session of 1828, uses the expression
 "strangulate," to convey this idea. As early as 1815, Brougham said: "It
 was well worth while to incur a loss on the exportation of English
 manufactures in order to stifle in the cradle the foreign manufactures."
 The report of the House of Commons on the condition of the mining district
 (1854) speaks of the great losses, frequently in from three to four years,
 of £300,000 to £400,000, which the employers of labor voluntarily
 underwent, in order to control foreign markets. "The large capitals of
 this country are the great instruments of warfare against the competing
 capital of foreign countries, and are the most essential instruments now
 remaining by which our manufacturing supremacy can be maintained."</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_A3-5-3"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_A3-5-3" class="pginternal">[A3-5-3]</a>
 Before the development of the machinery system, also, the preponderance of
 the greatest industrial power could not be nearly as oppressive as later;
 especially as in highly developed commercial countries, the wages of labor
 are always high. (<i>List</i>, Zollvereinsblatt, 1843, No. 44, 1845, No.
 5, ff.)</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_A3-5-4"></a>

 "Shall the forester wait until the wind in the course of centuries carries
 the seed from one place to another, and the barren heath is converted into
 a dense wood?" (<i>List</i>, Gesammelte Schriften, III, 123 seq.) When the
 Romans had conquered an industrial country, its industries began generally
 to flourish better, because of the greater market opened to them; whereas,
 those which had no industries before, continued, for the most part, to
 remain producers of the raw material after the conquest, also. Related to
 this is the phenomenon, that the provinces not favored by nature, were
 much less backward in the middle ages than they are to-day. Compare the
 description of the misery of Mitchelstown, after the Earl of Kingston had
 ceased to consume £40,000 there: <i>Inglis</i>, Journey through Ireland,
 1835, I, 142. The royal commission appointed to investigate the misery of
 Spessart in 1852, show that the home-made clothing had gone out of use
 there, and that the wooden shoes, so well adapted to wooded countries, had
 been changed for leather ones. This becoming acquainted with foreign wants
 in a region not adapted to industries, without a large market, greatly
 increased the distress. As soon as such a region becomes an independent
 state, a productive system would suggest itself.</p>

<i>List</i> very well remarks that otherwise most of our fruit trees,

<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_A3-5-6"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_A3-5-6" class="pginternal">[A3-5-6]</a>
 That a posterior people would never be in a condition to establish
 industries of their own, where full freedom of trade prevails, I do not by
 any means assert. Compare the list of industries which attained to so
 flourishing a condition without the aid of a protective tariff, that they
 were able to supply foreign markets, in <i>Rau</i>, Lehrbuch, II, § 206,
 a. But when Switzerland is so frequently cited as an illustration in this
 connection (<i>J. Bowring</i>, On the Commerce and Manufactures of
 Switzerland, 1836), people forget the many favorable circumstances of
 another kind which coöperated here to elevate industry; a neutrality of
 three hundred years, during the French Huguenot War, the Thirty Years'
 War, the Wars of Louis XIV., and as a consequence of this, no military
 budgets, few taxes and state debts, etc. In addition to this, at an
 earlier period, the many mercenary troops, and afterwards the foreign
 travelers.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_A3-5-7"></a>

 As free trade in Holland's best period was more an international law than
 a politico-economical system, so, afterwards, the Dutch protective system
 grew out of war prohibitions; and, in times of peace, the newly
 established industry was not abandoned. At last, in the time of its
 decline, all industries, with a strange logic, sought protection, even the
 most ancient one, the one whose growth was the most natural, the
 fisheries. (<i>Laspeyres</i>, Gesch. der volksw. Ansch., 134 ff., 146,
 159.) The United States, during the war of 1812, with England, doubled
 their protective duties. (<i>A. Young</i>, Report on the Customs-tariff
 Legislation of the U. S., 1874.)</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_A3-5-8"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_A3-5-8" class="pginternal">[A3-5-8]</a>
 Hence, we should not judge the Russian and the American systems of
 industrial protection, for instance, by the same rule. In Russia, it may
 be necessary to strengthen artificially the still weak bourgeoisie, and to
 awaken numberless slumbering forces and opportunities by encouragement of
 their use by state measures. Here, also, the absolute ruler is called
 upon, and accustomed to educate his people. In the United States, on the
 other hand, there is no nobility; the whole nation belongs to the class of
 burghers, and even the cultivators of the land are raisers of corn, cattle
 traders, land speculators etc. Considering the universal activity and
 laborious energy of the people, it is to be expected that every really
 profitable opportunity will be turned to account in such a country,
 without any suggestion or assistance from the state. Here, therefore,
 <i>A. Walker's</i> saying is true: America should produce no iron, not
 because it does not know how, because it has not sufficient capital,
 because the nature of the country is not adapted to it, or because it has
 no natural protection, but "because we can do better." (Sc. of W., 94
 seq.) Since a democracy cannot, properly speaking, educate the people, the
 protective duties of the United States are, for the most part, only
 attempts by one part of the people, who claim to be the whole, to prey
 upon the other parts.</p>

 The fact that among the ancients there was so little thought bestowed on
 the protection of industry is related to the comparative insignificance of
 their industry. Compare <i>Roscher</i>, Ansichten der Volkswirthschaft, 3
 ed., 1878, vol. 1, p. 23 ff. It occasionally happened in the east that
 workers in metal, especially the makers of metallic weapons, were dragged
 out of the country. I <i>Sam.</i>, 13, 19; II <i>Kings</i>, 24, 14 ff.;
 <i>Jerem.</i>, 24, 1, 29, 2. Among the Jews, certain costly products were
 subjected to export prohibitions for fear that the heathen might use them
 for purposes of sacrifice. (<i>Mischna</i>, De Cultu peregr., § 6.)
 Persian law, that the king should consume only home products:
 <i>Athen.</i>, V, p. 372; XIV, p. c. 62. The Athenians went farthest in
 reducing such provisions to a system. Solon had strictly prohibited the
 exportation of all raw material save oil (<i>Plutarch</i>, Sol., 24), and
 a complaint was allowed against any one who scoffed at a citizen because
 of the industry he carried on in the market. (<i>Demosth.</i>, adv.
 Eubul., p. 1308.) The exportation of corn was always prohibited; also that
 of the principal materials used in ship-building. In war, prohibitions of
 the exportation of weapons; importation from enemy countries also
 prohibited. No Athenian was permitted to loan money on ships which did not
 bring a return cargo to Athens (<i>Demosth.</i> adv. Lacrit., p. 941), nor
 carry wheat to any place but Athens. (<i>Böckh.</i>, Staatsh. der Ath., I,
 73 ff.) In Argos and Ægina, the importation of Athenian clay commodities
 and articles of adornment, prohibited. (<i>Herodot.</i>, V, 88; Athen.,
 IV, 13; XI, 60.)</p>
<p class="footnote">The Athenians imposed a duty of two per cent. both on
 imports and exports. Similarly, in Rome, where the higher duties imposed
 on many articles of luxury served an ethico-political purpose. We have,
 besides, accounts of prohibitions of the exportation of money:
 <i>Cicero</i>, pro Flacco, 28 (L., 2, Cod. Just., IV, 63). Plato's advice
 to prohibit the importation of luxuries and the exportation of the means
 of subsistence (<i>De Legg.</i>) on ethico-political considerations; and
 the Byzantine prohibition of the exportation of certain articles of
 display from court vanity. (Porph. Decaerim, p. 271 ff. Reiske.)</p>

 In Italy's best period, the protective system bears a specifically
 municipal complexion; in democracies, a guild-complexion; the former
 especially because of the many differential duties in favor of the
 capital.</p>
<p class="footnote">A very highly-developed protective system in Florence.
 The exportation of the means of subsistence forbidden (Della Decima, II,
 13), and so likewise the importation of finished cloths. (Stat Flor.,
 1415, V, p. 3; Rubr., 32, 39, 41, 43, 45.) In the streets devoted to the
 woolen industries, it was not permitted to give the manufacturers notice
 to quit their dwellings, nor to increase their rent, unless the
 connoisseurs in the industry had admitted a higher rate of profit.
 (Decima, II, 88.) In order to promote the silk industry, the importation
 of silk-worms and of the mulberry leaf was freed from the payment of
 duties in 1423, the exportation of raw silk, cocoons and of the mulberry
 leaf forbidden in 1443; and in 1440, every countryman was commanded to
 plant mulberry trees. (Decima, II, 115.) When Pisa was subdued, the
 Florentines reserved to themselves all the wholesale trade, and prohibited
 there all silk and woolen industries. (<i>Sismondi</i>, Gesch. der
 italienischen Republic, XII, 171.) It was a principle followed by Milan in
 its best period, to exempt manufacturers from taxation. Yearly subsidies,
 accorded about 1442, to Florentine silk-manufacturers, who immigrated; in
 1493, a species of <i>expropriation</i>, in case of houses which a
 neighbor needed for manufacturing purposes. (<i>Verri</i>, Mem. Storiche,
 p. 62.) Bolognese prohibition of the exportation of manuscripts, because
 they wanted to monopolize science. (<i>Cibrario</i>, E. polit. del. medio.
 Evo., III, 166.) Even in the seventeenth century, a city like Urbino
 forbade the exportation of cattle, wheat, wood, wool, skins, coal, as well
 as the importation of cloth, with the exception of the very costliest
 kinds. (Constitut. Due. Urbin., I, p. 388 ff., 422 ff.)</p>

 In England, since the fourteenth century, all genuinely national and
 popular kings always bore it in mind both to secure emancipation from the
 Hanseates, to invite foreigners skilled in industry to the country (the
 Flemings since 1331, although the English people disliked to see them
 come; <i>Rymer</i>, Foedd., IV, 496) and to adopt protective measures,
 especially when they had reason to rely on the bourgeoisie. (<i>Pauli</i>,
 Gesch. von England, V, 372.) The precursors of the navigation act, 1381,
 1390, 1440. (<i>Anderson</i>, Origin of Commerce.) The prohibition of
 exporting raw wool (1337, II Edw. III., c. 1 ff.) lasted only one year.
 Wool remained a long time still so much of a chief staple commodity that
 in 1354, for instance, £277,000 worth were exported; of all other
 commodities taken together, only £16,400. (<i>Anderson.</i>) On the other
 hand, the prohibition to import foreign stuffs (1337), for instance, was
 repeated in 1399, and the prohibition to export woolen yarn and unfulled
 cloths in 1376, 1467, 1488. The statutes of employment operated very
 generally. The statutes provided that foreign merchants should employ the
 English money they received only to purchase English commodities, and
 their hosts, with whom they were obliged to live, had to become security
 therefor. Thus, in 1390, 4 Henry IV., c. 15, and 15 Henry IV., c. 9; 18
 Henry VI., c. 4, 1477. Prohibitions of the exportation of money, 1335,
 1344, 1381. Even in the case of payment by the bishops to the pope, the
 exportation of money was forbidden in 1391, 1406, 1414. Henry VIII. (3
 Henry VIII., c. 1) threatened the exportation of money with the penalty of
 double payment. Even in 1455, the importation of all finished silk wares
 was prohibited for five years. See a long list of similar prohibitions in
 <i>Anderson</i>. The prohibitions relating to the exporting of raw
 materials, and especially wool, were exceedingly strict in Elizabeth's
 time, and stricter yet in the seventeenth century. The penalty of death
 was attached to their violation, and producers subjected to the most
 burthensome control. Moderated especially by 8 Geo. I., c. 15. In the
 eighteenth century we again find a series of import-premiums for raw
 material from the English colonies. Compare <i>Adam Smith</i>, IV, ch.
 8.</p>

<i>Sismondi</i>, Histoire des Français, XIX, 126, considers as the
 beginning of the French industrial protective system, the edict of 1572,
 by which, with a view of promoting the woolen, hemp and linen
 manufactures, the exportation of the raw material and the importation of
 the finished commodities are prohibited. (<i>Isambert</i>, Recueil, XIV,
 p. 241.) Yet even Philip IV., in 1302, had prohibited the exportation of
 the precious metals, of corn, wine and other means of subsistence.
 (Ordonn., I, 351, 372.) About 1332, the decision of the question whether
 the exportation of wool also should be forbidden was made to depend on who
 offered the most, the raw-producers or those engaged in industry.
 (<i>Sismondi</i>, X, 67 seq.) The third estate not unfrequently asked for
 protective measures from the parliaments: thus, in 1484, a prohibition
 against the importation of cloth and silk stuffs, and against the
 exportation of money (<i>Sismondi</i>, XIV, 673), claims which went much
 further in 1614, when freedom of trade, reform of the guilds, etc., were
 desired. Opposition of Sully to the industrial-political measures of Henry
 IV., whose prohibition of foreign and gold stuffs lasted scarcely one
 year. (<i>Forbonnais</i>, Finances de Fr., c. 44.) The edict of 1664,
 which, for the first time, created a boundary tariff-system for the
 greater part of France, with the removal of numerous export and import
 duties of the several provinces, and the abolition even of the
 duty-liberties of the King's court, marks an epoch. The introduction in
 which Colbert lets the King speak of his services to the taxation-system,
 the marine, colonies, etc., in which he describes the chaos of those
 earlier duties, and demonstrates their desirability of doing away with
 them, is very interesting. Colbert, inconsistently enough, allowed a
 number of export duties for industrial products to remain, that he might
 not alienate any domanial rights. (<i>Forbonnais</i>, I, 352.) The tariff,
 then very moderate, was, in 1677, doubled in part, and even trebled, which
 provoked retaliation, and led to the war of 1672. Hence, in 1678, the
 tariff of 1664 was, for the most part, restored. Colbert entirely
 prohibited these commodities, which were still imported, spite of the
 tariff: thus, Venetian mirrors and laces in 1669 and 1671. Among his
 characteristic measures are the export-premiums for salt-meats which went
 to the colonies in order to draw this business away from Holland to
 France. (<i>Forbonnais</i>, I, 465.) He caused the transit between
 Portugal and Flanders to be made through France by providing that it
 should be carried on by means of royal ships at any price.
 (<i>Forbonnais</i>, I, 438.) Compare <i>Clement</i>, Histoire de la vie et
 de l'Administration de C. (1846). <i>Jonbleau</i>, Études sur C. ou
 Exposition du Système d'Économie Politique suivi de 1661 à 1683 (II,
 1856). Lettres, Instructions et Mémoires de C. publiés par Clément (1861

<a href="#fnanchor_A3-6-5" class="pginternal">[A3-6-5]</a>
 In Germany, the tariff projects of the empire of 1522, contemplated no
 protection, inasmuch as imports and exports were equally taxed, but the
 importation of the most necessary means of subsistence was left free.
 Prohibition of the exportation of the precious metals in 1524; of the
 exportation of raw wool <i>mit grossen Haufen</i> (R. P. O., of 1548, art.
 21; 1566, and in the R. P. O. of 1577, limited to the pleasure of the
 several districts). Hence, in Brandenburg, 1572 and 1578, the Saxons,
 Pommeranians and Mecklenburghers were prohibited to export wool and to
 import cloth, in retaliation. Individual states had much earlier adopted
 protective measures: Göttingen, in 1430, prohibited the exportation of
 yarn, and in 1438, the wearing of foreign woolen stuffs. (<i>Havemann</i>,
 Gesch. von Braunschweig und Luneburg, I, 780 seq.) Hanseatic politics
 recall in many respects the Venetian. After 1426, the sale of Prussian
 ships to non-Hanseates was made as difficult as possible; and in 1433, the
 importation of Spanish wool was prohibited in order to compel the payment
 of debts by Spain. (<i>Hirsch</i>, Gesch. des Danziger, H. 87, 268.)
 Prohibition of the exportation of the precious metals to Russia at the end
 of the thirteenth century. <i>Sartorius</i>, II, 444, 453, III, 191. The
 elector, Augustus of Saxony, forbade the exportation of corn, wool, hemp
 and flax (Cod. Aug. I., 1414). The Bavarian L. O., of 1553, prohibits
 generally the sale of corn, cattle, malt, tallow, leather or other
 <i>Plennwerthe</i> to foreigners; which prohibition was, in 1557, limited
 to cattle, malt, tallow, wool and yarn.</p>
<p class="footnote">The protective system received its most important
 development in Prussia. Prohibition by the margrave, about the end of the
 thirteenth century, of the exportation of woolen yarn. (<i>Stengel</i>,
 Pr. Gesch., I, 84.) In the privilege accorded to the weavers of woolen
 wares, in 1414, the importation of the less important cloths is forbidden
 for two years. (<i>Droysen</i>, Preuss. Gesch. I, 323.) The prohibition of
 the exportation of wool of 1582 assigns as a reason of the prohibition,
 that the numerous leading weavers should not be ruined for the sake of a
 few unmarried journeymen and sellers. (<i>Mylius</i>, C. C. M., V, 2,
 207.) In the prohibitions of 1611 and 1629, the domains, the estates of
 prelates and knights were exempted; similarly, in Saxony, 1613-1626; which
 is one of the many symptoms of the then growing <i>Junkerthum</i>. The
 great elector, who attached, both in war and peace, great value to the
 possession of coasts, men-of-war and colonies, forbade, for instance, the
 importation of copper and brass wares (1654), of glass (1658), of steel
 and iron (1666), of tin (1687); farther, the exportation of wool (1644),
 leather (1669), skins and furs (1678), silver (1683), rags (1685). Home
 commodities were, for the most part, stamped with the elector's arms, and
 all which were not so stamped were prohibited. The prohibition was
 generally preceded by a notice that the elector had himself established or
 improved a manufactory, or that the guilds (<i>Innungen</i>) had entered
 complaints against foreign competition. Not till 1682 did the idea occur
 to impose a moderate excise on the home product to be favored, and a much
 higher duty on the foreign one; thus in the case of sugar. (<i>Mylius</i>,
 IV, 3, 2, 16.) Frederick I. continued this system especially for the
 forty-three branches of industry hitherto unknown, and the introduction of
 which was contemporaneous with the reception of the Huguenots.
 (<i>Stengel</i>, 3, 48, 208.) Frederick William I., in 1719 and 1723,
 threatened the exportation of wool, under certain circumstances, with
 death. (<i>Mylius</i>, V, 2, 4, 64, 80.) The severity with which he
 insisted that his officials and officers should wear only home cloth is
 characteristic; and the fact that in 1719 he threatened tailors who worked
 foreign cloth, with heavy money fines and the loss of their guild-rights.
 At the same time all workers in wool were freed from military duty, and
 capitalists who had loaned money to wool manufacturers were given a
 preference (1729). Frederick the Great, who continued nearly all this,
 prohibited the exportation of Silesian yarn, with the exception of the
 very coarsest and finest, as well as of that which had been bleached. Its
 exportation was allowed to Bohemia only, because from here the linen went
 back again to Silesia to be bleached and sold there. (<i>Mirabeau</i>, De
 la Monarchie Pruss., II, 54.)</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_A3-6-6"></a>

 Important beginnings of a protective system in Sweden, under Gustavus
 Wasa, and again under Charles IX., the violent opponent of the supremacy
 of the nobility (<i>Geijer</i>, Schwed. Gesch. II, 118 ff., 346); while
 Christian II., of Denmark, failed in all such endeavors. The founder of
 the Russian industrial protection was Peter the Great, who was in complete
 accordance with the native theorist, <i>I. Possoschkow</i>: Compare
 <i>Brückner</i>, in the Baltische Monatschrift, Bd. VI (1862), and VI
 (1863). Spain first adopted a real protective system under the Bourbons.
 The export prohibitions issued mostly at the request of the cortes between
 1550 and 1560 (<i>Ranke</i>, Fürsten und Völker, I, 400 ff.) must be
 considered as a remnant of the medieval scarcity-policy, induced
 principally by a misunderstood depreciation of the precious metals.</p>

respect to fashionable commodities, so that they will hardly purchase such
from abroad, even without a protective tariff; and the cultured of most

<i>Colbert</i> advised the companies in Lyons to consider the privileges
 granted them only as crutches, by means of which they might learn to walk
 the soonest possible, it being the intention afterwards to do away with
 them. (Journ. des Econom., Mai, 1854, p. 277.) Thiers said, in the chamber
 of deputies, in 1834: <i>Employé comme représailles,</i><a id="fnanchor_TN132"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_TN132">[TN 132]</a> <i>le tarif est funeste; Comme faveur, il

 importable il est impuissant et inutile. Employé pour protéger un produit,
 qui a chance de réussir, il est bon; mais il est bon temporairement, il
 doit finer quand l'education de l'industrie est finie, quand elle est
 adulte.</i> <i>Schmitthenner</i>, Zwölf Bücher vom Staate, I, 657 ff.,
 admits that full freedom of trade between England and Germany would be
 advantageous to the world in general; but that England might here secure
 the entire gain even at the cost of Germany, in part.
 <i>Schmitthenner's</i> view is distinguished from that of <i>List's</i>,
 against which <i>Schmitthenner</i> zealously seeks to maintain the
 priority of his own (II, 365), disadvantageously enough, by this, that it
 contains no pledge of subsequent freedom of trade. <i>List</i>, on the
 contrary, considers universal freedom of trade, not only as the ideal, but
 also as the object which is to be striven for by temporary limitations on
 trade; an object, indeed, attainable only where there are a great many
 nations highly developed and in an equal degree, just as perpetual peace
 supposes a plurality of states equal in power. Ges. Schr., II, 35; III,
 194. Compare, on this point, <i>Hildebrand</i>, N. O. der Gegenwart und
 Zukunft, I, 87. That <i>Carey</i> advocates a perpetual protective tariff
 is connected with his absolute inability to conceive the Malthusian law of
 population. (<i>Held</i>, Carey's Socialwissenschaft und das

<p class="footnote">Thus, for instance, the prohibition of foreign cloths
 in Florence begins in 1393, that is, at a time when the protected industry
 had long been developed, so that its products were exported on a great
 scale, but when it began to fear the young, vigorous, competition of the

 How frequently it happened in the conquests of the French revolution or of
 Napoleon, or when the Zollverein was extended, that two territories, now
 united to each other, feared an outflanking of their industries, each by
 the other, whose competition was formerly excluded; and that, afterwards,
 the abolition of the barriers to trade worked advantageously to both
 parties! (<i>Dunoyer</i>, Liberté du Travail, VII, ch. 3.) The Belgian
 manufacture of (coarse) porcelain flourished under Napoleon, spite of the
 competition of Sèvres. It declined after the separation from France,
 notwithstanding protective duties of 20 per cent. (<i>Briavoinne</i>,
 Industrie Belge, II, 483.) The French cotton manufacturers feared, in
 1791, that the incorporation of Mülhausen would necessarily produce their
 downfall.</p>

 In Venice, the relations of a workman who had emigrated and refused to
 return home were imprisoned. If this was of no avail, the emigrant was to
 be put to death. (<i>Daru</i>, Hist. de V., III, 90.) It is said that this
 was still the practice in 1754. (Acad. des Sc. mor. et polit., 1866, I,
 132.) Florence, in 1419, threatened its subjects who carried on the
 brocade or silk industry, in foreign countries, with death. Similarly,
 when the Nürnberg Rothgiessers were prohibited, under pain of the house of
 correction, showing their mills to a stranger. (<i>Roth</i>, Gesch. des N.
 Handles, III, 176.) In Belgium, enticing manufacturers of bone lace to
 emigrate was made punishable. Austrian prohibition for glass-makers, in
 1752; for scythe-makers, in 1781. Colbert also approved of the
 imprisonment of manufacturers desirous to emigrate. (Lettres, etc., II,
 568 ff.) By 5 Geo. I., ch. 28, and 23 Geo. II., ch. 13, the soliciting of
 an artificer to emigrate to foreign countries is punished by one year's
 imprisonment and £500 fine; and even workmen who do not respond to a call
 home within six months lose all their reachable property in England, and
 their capacity to inherit there. Every emigrant had to certify that he was
 no artificer. The only effect of this law was that the emigration of
 artificers to the United States was made by the way of Canada; the poorer
 ones, at most, were kept back by the cost of this circuitous route. Hence
 the law was repealed in 1825. Compare Edinb. Rev., XXXIX, p. 341 ff.</p>

 The first English prohibition of the exportation of machinery was made in
 reference to the Lee stocking frame, in 1696, the second in 1750;
 whereupon others followed very rapidly after 1774. As late as 1825,
 prohibitions of the exportation of a large number of machines and of parts
 of machines were still in force; but the Board of Trade might dispense
 with them. Here it was considered whether a greater disadvantage was
 caused to the industries by permitting the exportation, or to the
 manufacturers of the machines by prohibiting it. <i>Porter</i>, Progress,
 I, 318 ff., recommends full freedom of exportation especially for the
 reason that Englishmen can now procure all new machines, and sell the old
 ones to foreign countries. On the other hand, a French manufacturer
 purchased old machines <i>parce que sous le système prohibitif je gagnerai
 encore de l'argent avec ces metiers</i>. (<i>Rau</i>, Lehrbuch, II, §

<a href="#fnanchor_A3-7-7" class="pginternal">[A3-7-7]</a>
 How much more convenient it is for the statesman, when he does not need to
 give any thought to the education of industry, is shown, especially by the
 great difficulty of striking precisely the proper height of a protective
 tariff. If too low, it fails of its object; and so, likewise, if too high;
 because then, in a very unpedagogical way, it lulls one into a lazy
 security. And how impossible it is to make the tariff vary with every
 variation in the cost of production, in price, etc.; as List desired it
 should, not, however, without a good deal of variation in his own views.
 (<i>Roscher</i>, Gesch. der N. O., II, 989 seq.) How greatly would not
 List have been obliged to limit his assumptions, if he had lived to see
 the universal exposition of 1862, at which English connoisseurs expressed
 their pleasure that England had not remained behind France and Germany in
 locomotive building? (Ausland, 19 Oct., 1862.) Hence <i>Schäffle</i>
 opposes all protective duties as an educational measure, because the
 "protected" classes, by means of diets (<i>Landtage</i>), newspapers, etc.
 so greatly influence legislation; that is, the educator is influenced by
 the pupil! (System, 409 ff.) The usual calculation of the cost for home
 undertakers (<i>Unternehmer</i>) can always only strike the average, and
 hence it is too high for some and too low for others. (<i>Rau</i>,
 Lehrbuch, II, § 214.) It frequently occurs that large manufacturers
 already existing desire a low protective tariff to facilitate their
 competition with foreign countries, possible even without such tariff, but
 not high enough to encourage others to compete with them at home.</p>

<p class="center smaller">INDUSTRIAL-PROTECTIVE POLICY IN PARTICULAR.</p>
<p>If it be once established generally that an industry is to be
artificially promoted, and if there be question only of a choice between
the different measures to be adopted to thus promote it, moderate<a id="fnanchor_A3-8-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A3-8-1">[A3-8-1]</a> import duties are not only the most equable,
least <span class="pagenum">[Pg 450]</span> subject to abuse, but also
attended by the greatest number of secondary advantages. Here the sacrifice
is imposed on all the consumers of the "protected" commodity, that is, on
the entire people, to the extent that they come in contact with the
commodity in question. Export duties on raw materials, on the other hand,
compel one single class of the people to make sacrifices in order to
advance the favored industry.<a id="fnanchor_A3-8-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A3-8-2">[A3-8-2]</a> Export premiums for commodities on which labor has
been expended are distinguished from import duties as the offensive from
the defensive: the former promote the artificial trade, the trade which has
gone beyond its natural basis, the latter curtail it.</p>
<p>Premiums, advances without interest, gifts of machinery etc., to persons
engaged in industry would operate very usefully under an omniscient
government.<a id="fnanchor_A3-8-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A3-8-3">[A3-8-3]</a> But they generally
fall to the lot not of the most skillful manufacturers, but of the most
acceptable supplicants, who now are doubly dangerous to the former as
competitors.<a id="fnanchor_A3-8-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A3-8-4">[A3-8-4]</a> The same is true to a
still greater extent of monopolies granted to undertakings which <span class="pagenum">[Pg 451]</span> it is intended to promote.<a id="fnanchor_A3-8-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A3-8-5">[A3-8-5]</a> They require, at least, to be vigilantly
superintended in case of sale from one person to another; otherwise the
individual to whom they were first granted is very apt to withdraw with the
capitalized value of the privilege accorded, and his successors, loaded
with a heavy debt in the nature of a mortgage, to derive no advantage from
it.<a id="fnanchor_A3-8-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A3-8-6">[A3-8-6]</a></p>
<p>Further, import duties, besides the fiscal advantage which they afford,
have the police advantage that they may, like quarantine provisions,
prevent somewhat the inroads of many economic diseases: thus, for instance,
gluts of the market, and still more, the severe chronic disease of
ruinously low wages.<a id="fnanchor_A3-8-7"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A3-8-7">[A3-8-7]</a> But only very
moderate hopes from protective duties should be entertained in all such
respects as these.<a id="fnanchor_A3-8-8"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A3-8-8">[A3-8-8]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 452]</span>Prohibition proper operates, as a
rule, very disastrously.<a id="fnanchor_A3-8-9"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A3-8-9">[A3-8-9]</a> It spoils those engaged in industry by a feeling of
too great security (mortals' chiefest enemy: Shakespeare). It may even lead
to complete monopoly, when the industry requires very large means and the
country is small. The inducement to smuggling is peculiarly great here. But
even duties, so high that they far exceed the insurance premium of
smuggling, can be of very little advantage either to industry or to the
exchequer. They can only promote the smuggling trade. However, the repeal
of an import prohibition or the abolition of a tariff approaching to a
prohibition should be announced long enough in advance to enable the
capital invested in the protected industry to be withdrawn without too
heavy a loss.</p>

 In general, <i>Mäser</i> was in favor of <i>Colbert</i>, and opposed to
 <i>Mirabeau</i>. (P. Ph. II, 26.) He ridicules the prohibitions of the
 exportation of raw material by saying that not only flax-seed, flax-yarn,
 but also the linen, must remain in the country. As Raphael Mengs once
 ennobled four ells of linen to a value of 10,000 ducats, a hundred Mengs
 should be sent for, to the end that all the linen should be exported
 painted. (v. 25.)</p>

<a href="#fnanchor_A3-8-2" class="pginternal">[A3-8-2]</a>
<i>Rau</i>, Lehrbuch, II, § 214, would prefer to tolerate state premiums
 (politically so dangerous), rather than protective duties, because, in the
 case of the former, the magnitude of the assumed sacrifice may be exactly
 estimated in advance. Similarly, <i>Bastiat</i>, Sophismes, ch. 5.</p>

 Under <i>Colbert</i>, the granting of a monopoly had frequently no effect
 but to ruin an already existing rural industry in the interest of a city
 manufactory. Thus, in the case of lace, in Bourges and Alençon, and soap
 in the south, etc. The upshot of the matter in some places was simply that
 the carriers on of industry on a small scale were allowed to carry on
 their industries in consideration of a payment made to the owners of the
 privilege. (Journ. des Econ., 1857, II, 290.) The King of Denmark bought
 back, in 1756, at a high price, industrial privileges which his
 predecessors had granted gratis. (<i>Justi</i>, Polizeiwissensch., § 444.)
 The Colbert monopoly of the Hollander v. Robais (1665), who was the first
 to manufacture fine cloths in France, was not abolished until 1767.
 (Encycl. Mech. Arts et Manuf., II, 345.)</p>

 Thus, for instance, in 1863, the apothecary shops of the governmental
 district of Breslau had a value of 2,791,227 thalers, of which the land
 and inventories of stock were only 29 per cent. The concessions
 represented 71 per cent. The sick, in the entire state of Prussia, were
 obliged to contribute 1,780,000 thalers a year to compensate these
 monopolists. Compare <i>Brefeld</i>, Die Apotheken, Schutz oder Freiheit?
 (1863).</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_A3-8-6"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_A3-8-6" class="pginternal">[A3-8-6]</a>
<i>Hermann</i>, in his review of Dönniges' System des freien Handels und
 der Schützzölle (Münch. G. A. Sept. und Octbr., 1847) calls attention to
 the point that a decrease of the cost of production, by merely lowering
 wages, is no gain to the national resources, but only an altered
 distribution of them, for the most part a very unfavorable one. But when a
 nation is advancing on this road, it may strengthen its exportation by
 such means, as it might granting export premiums at the expense of the
 workmen. This would lead, on the supposition of entire freedom of trade,
 to a corresponding depression of the lower classes in other countries; and
 against such contagion a protective tariff may operate in a manner similar
 to the quarantine. This is much exaggerated by <i>Colton</i>, Public
 Economy of the United States (1849), p. 65, 178. America needs a
 protective tariff more than any other nation, because of its dear workmen
 and capital. In Europe, the upper classes rob labor of its product, while
 in America, labor itself enjoys its products. Free trade would lower
 America to the level of Europe.</p>

 Severe crisis in the woolen industries of America in 1874 ff., spite of an
 enormously high protective tariff. The financial utility of a protective
 tariff can be scarcely great, because the intention of the tariff to
 permit as little as possible to be imported, and of the tax to levy as
 much as possible, are irreconcilable.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a id="footnote_A3-8-8"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_A3-8-8" class="pginternal">[A3-8-8]</a>
 Frederick II., in 1766, forbade the importation of 490 different
 commodities which, up to that time, had only paid high duties.
 (<i>Mirabeau</i>, Monarchie, Pr., II, 168.) In 1835, France still had 58
 import and 25 export prohibitions.</p>
<p class="footnote">They might, by way of exception, become necessary, in
 case a foreign state should desire to make our protective duties illusory
 by export premiums. But the exportation of Prussian cotton stuffs, for
 instance, has increased, with a moderate tariff, much more than the
 Austrian, with full prohibition. The English silk manufactures were, so
 long as the prohibition continued, inferior to the French, even in respect
 to the machinery system. (<i>McCulloch</i>, Statist., I, 681.)</p>

<a href="#fnanchor_A3-8-9" class="pginternal">[A3-8-9]</a>
 In the case of circulating capital this is generally done rapidly. The
 machines would have worn out, and care is taken not to renew them.
 Buildings also can, for the most part, serve other purposes. The most
 difficult thing of all is for the masses of men, gathered together at the
 principal seats of industry, artificially created, to distribute
 themselves. Between the two rules: "No leap, but gradual transition," and
 "cut the dog's tail off at once, not piecemeal," the right mean is struck
 in the abolition of a prohibitive protection, when, what it is intended to
 do, is announced long in advance without maintaining vain hopes, and a
 long space of time is left to enable people to make their arrangements
 accordingly. This plan was followed in a model manner in reference to the
 English silk prohibition, under Huskisson. It was announced as early as
 1824 that protective duties of 30 per cent. would on the 5th of July,
 1826, take the place of the prohibition. The duty on raw silk was
 immediately reduced from 4 sh. to 3d. per pound, and after a time, even to
 1d., which so increased the demand that the number of spindles rapidly
 increased from 780,000 to 1,180,000. During the 10 years from 1824, the
 importation of raw and twisted silk amounted to about 1,941,000 pounds,
 and in the 10 years after, to 4,164,000 pounds. The English exports of
 silk wares had before 1824 a value of £350,000 to £380,000; in 1830, of
 over £521,000; in 1854, of almost £1,700,000; in 1863, of £3,147,000.
 Compare <i>Porter</i>, Progress, I, 255 ff. On the other hand, Austria was
 over-hasty when it went over from the prohibition of foreign silk stuffs
 to duties of 180 florins per cwt. (Oest. Weltausstellungsbericht von 1867,
 IV, 140.)</p>

<p class="center smaller">WHAT INDUSTRIES ONLY SHOULD BE FAVORED.</p>
<p>That as a rule only such industries should be favored which, by reason
of the natural capacities of the country and of the people, have a good
prospect of being able soon to dispense with the favors accorded, would be
self-evident were it not for the fact that it has been ignored a thousand
times in practice.<a id="fnanchor_A3-9-1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A3-9-1">[A3-9-1]</a> It is especially
necessary to take the natural station (<i>Standort</i>)<a id="fnanchor_A3-9-2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A3-9-2">[A3-9-2]</a> as well as the natural succession of the
different branches of industry into consideration. Half manufactured
articles of <span class="pagenum">[Pg 454]</span> foreign raw material
should not be protected until the entire manufactured article has
completely outgrown protection; which condition manifests itself most
clearly by a strong, independent exportation of the article.<a id="fnanchor_A3-9-3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A3-9-3">[A3-9-3]</a> The celebrated tariff controversy between
the cotton spinners and the weavers in the Zollverein was probably without
any conscious plan, but certainly to the well-being of German industry,
settled essentially in accordance with these principles. In such struggles
of the different stages of a branch of production with one another, it is
necessary not only mechanically to weigh the number of workmen, the amount
of capital, etc., on both sides, but also organically the capacity for
development and the influence of both sides on the entire national life.<a id="fnanchor_A3-9-4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A3-9-4">[A3-9-4]</a> Half-manufactured <span class="pagenum">[Pg
455]</span> articles of a very superior quality should not be kept away,
since by promoting commodities of the first quality they have an
educational influence on the whole industry. Thus, in the case of the
duties on iron, it should not be forgotten, that they enhance the price of
all instruments of industry.<a id="fnanchor_A3-9-5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A3-9-5">[A3-9-5]</a> Just as objectionable are protective duties for
machines or for intellectual elements of training.<a id="fnanchor_A3-9-6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#footnote_A3-9-6">[A3-9-6]</a></p>

<i>Torrens</i> calls an industry which can, in the long run, bear no
 competition: "A parasitical formation, wanting the vital energies while
 permitted to remain, and yet requiring for its removal a painful
 operation." (Budget, p. 49.) Especially frequent in the case of
 luxury—industries in which the court was interested. The oysters
 which were sent for to Venice under Leopold I., in order to stock the
 artificial beds in the garden of the president of the Exchequer reached
 Vienna, dead. (<i>Mailath</i>, Gesch., IV, 384.) As to how Elizabeth, and
 Catharine II. in Russia, desired to compel the cultivation of silk, and
 caused the peasantry to be levied like recruits for that purpose; as to
 how the latter petitioned against it in a thousand ways, and endeavored to
 destroy the silk worms, mulberry trees, etc., see <i>Pallas</i>, Reise
 durch das südliche Russland, I, 154 ff. Frederick II.'s silk-protection is
 characterized mainly by the order for church-inspectors to keep tables
 (<i>Tabellen</i>) concerning it, and to look after clergymen's and
 teachers' knowledge of the cultivation of silk. Tragico-comic endeavors of
 the Shah Nasreddin to establish manufactories in Persia: <i>Pollak</i>,
 Persien, II, 138 ff. One of the principal effects of the Mexican
 protective system, since 1827, was the establishing of manufactories on
 the coast only to cover up smuggling. (<i>Wappäus</i>, Mexiko, 83 ff.)</p>

 Even before <i>Colbert's</i> time, French jewelry was prepared from
 Italian gold wire, and exported in great quantities. The mere rumor that
 it was contemplated to impose heavy duties on gold wire, provoked plans
 for the removal of the industry from Geneva to Avignon.
 (<i>Farbonnais</i>, F. de Fr., I, 275.) When France protects its raw silk,
 it makes the purchase of raw material in Italy cheaper to all its
 competitors.</p>

<a href="#fnanchor_A3-9-4" class="pginternal">[A3-9-4]</a>
 According to <i>L. Kühne</i> (Preuss. Staatszeitung, 17 Decbr., 1842), the
 cotton yarn consumption of Germany amounted to 561,000 cwt. per annum, of
 which the home spin-houses yielded 194,000 cwt. Weaving employed 311,500
 workmen with 32,250,000 thalers wages, spinning only 16,300 workmen with a
 little over 1,000,000 thalers wages. Even if the entire yarn-want
 (<i>Garnbedarf</i>) were spun in the interior, yet spinning would stand to
 weaving only as 1:5 in the number of workmen, and as 1:8 in the amount of
 wages. Hence the tariff of the Zollverein defended by Prussia, placed the
 tariff on tissues (<i>Gewebe</i>) 25 times as high as on yarn, while their
 prices stood to each other as 1:3-4. <i>List</i> (Zollvereinsblatt, 1844,
 No. 40 ff.) objected that only by spinning industries of its own could
 Germany's cotton-tissue industries become independent; since it was a very
 different thing to procure the material to be worked from the many
 mutually competing cotton countries, rather than from an intermediate
 hand; and indeed, from the most powerful industrial country of the world.
 (Compare, however, <i>Faucher's</i> Vierteljahrsschrift, 1863, Bd. I.)
 Besides, there is the great importance of the spinning industries, in
 order to come into immediate connection with America, the most rapidly
 growing market, to influence Holland, and also to advance navigation and
 the manufacture of machinery. In opposition to <i>Kühne's</i> calculation,
 <i>List</i> says: A man who lost eyes, ears, fingers and toes, would
 undergo only a small loss of weight.</p>

 Frederick II. threatened the prosecution of one's studies at a foreign
 university with a lifelong exclusion from all civil and ecclesiastical
 offices; and, in the case of the nobility, even with the confiscation of

<h3>Transcriber's Notes:</h3>
<p>Footnotes were moved to the end of the section to which they pertain.
Because footnote numbers in the original begin at '1' for each section, the
section number has been added before the footnote number, e.g. <span class="smaller"> <sup>[156-1]</sup></span>. Anchors for footnotes 208-4 and
232-5, missing in the original text, were placed in their most likely
position. Spelling corrections and transliterations of Greek are provided
as footnotes, below, annotated as <span class="smaller"><sup>[TN
1]</sup></span>.</p>
<p>In the Index to Names of Authors, references to sections 1 - 143 pertain
to Volume 1. See https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27698. <a id="TN"></a>Eight entries have section numbers following the Roman
numeral "II" that may have been inadvertently added by the publisher to
this book from an earlier edition. There is no text in this book to which
links could be established for these eight entries.</p>
<p>Punctuation, including accents in French and Spanish, was standardized.
Hyphenated words were standardized. For consistency with the remaining
text, an umlaut was added to 'coöperate.' Duplicate words, e.g. 'the the,'
were removed. Obsolete and alternative spellings were retained.</p>
<p>A few tables were adjusted with addition of column headers, use of key
codes instead of headers, and addition of decimal points within column
data, to improve display in browsers and e-readers.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

</div><div>
To protect the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg”), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg™ License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™
electronic works
</div><div>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div><div>
1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div><div>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div><div>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div><div>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div><div>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div><blockquote><div>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div></blockquote><div>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div><div>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div><div>
1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.
</div><div>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.
</div><div>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain

Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

</div><div class="secthead">
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
