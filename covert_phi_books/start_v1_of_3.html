<span style="font-size: 173%">Translators' Preface.</span></h1>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The style of
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung”</span>
        is sometimes loose and involved, as is so often the case in German
        philosophical treatises. The translation of the book has consequently
        been a matter of no little difficulty. It was found that extensive
        alteration of the long and occasionally involved sentences, however
        likely to prove conducive to a satisfactory English style, tended not
        only to obliterate the form of the original but even to imperil the
        meaning. Where a choice has had to be made, the alternative of a
        somewhat slavish adherence to Schopenhauer's <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ipsissima verba</span></span> has accordingly
        been preferred to that of inaccuracy. The result is a piece of work
        which leaves much to be desired, but which has yet consistently
        sought to reproduce faithfully the spirit as well as the letter of
        the original.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As regards the
        rendering of the technical terms about which there has been so much
        controversy, the equivalents used have only been adopted after
        careful consideration of their meaning in the theory of knowledge.
        For example, <span class="tei tei-q">“Vorstellung”</span> has been
        rendered by <span class="tei tei-q">“idea,”</span> in preference to
        <span class="tei tei-q">“representation,”</span> which is neither
        accurate, intelligible, nor elegant. <span class="tei tei-q">“Idee,”</span> is translated by the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagevi">[pg vi]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pgvi"></a> same word, but spelled with a
        capital,—<span class="tei tei-q">“Idea.”</span> Again, <span class="tei tei-q">“Anschauung”</span> has been rendered according to the
        context, either by <span class="tei tei-q">“perception”</span>
        simply, or by <span class="tei tei-q">“intuition or
        perception.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Notwithstanding
        statements to the contrary in the text, the book is probably quite
        intelligible in itself, apart from the treatise <span class="tei tei-q">“On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient
        Reason.”</span> It has, however, been considered desirable to add an
        abstract of the latter work in an appendix to the third volume of
        this translation.</p>

<span style="font-size: 173%">Preface To The First
        Edition.</span></h1>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I propose to point
        out here how this book must be read in order to be thoroughly
        understood. By means of it I only intend to impart a single thought.
        Yet, notwithstanding all my endeavours, I could find no shorter way
        of imparting it than this whole book. I hold this thought to be that
        which has very long been sought for under the name of philosophy, and
        the discovery of which is therefore regarded by those who are
        familiar with history as quite as impossible as the discovery of the
        philosopher's stone, although it was already said by Pliny:
        <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Quam multa fieri non posse, priusquam sint
        facta, judicantur?</span></span> (Hist. nat. 7, 1.)</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">According as we
        consider the different aspects of this one thought which I am about
        to impart, it exhibits itself as that which we call metaphysics, that
        which we call ethics, and that which we call æsthetics; and certainly
        it must be all this if it is what I have already acknowledged I take
        it to be.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">system of
        thought</span></em> must always have an architectonic connection or
        coherence, that is, a connection in which one part always supports
        the other, though the latter does not support the former, in which
        ultimately the foundation supports all the rest without being
        supported by it, and the apex is supported without supporting. On the
        other hand, a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">single thought</span></em>, however
        comprehensive <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pageviii">[pg
        viii]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pgviii"></a>
        it may be, must preserve the most perfect unity. If it admits of
        being broken up into parts to facilitate its communication, the
        connection of these parts must yet be organic, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, it
        must be a connection in which every part supports the whole just as
        much as it is supported by it, a connection in which there is no
        first and no last, in which the whole thought gains distinctness
        through every part, and even the smallest part cannot be completely
        understood unless the whole has already been grasped. A book,
        however, must always have a first and a last line, and in this
        respect will always remain very unlike an organism, however like one
        its content may be: thus form and matter are here in
        contradiction.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is self-evident
        that under these circumstances no other advice can be given as to how
        one may enter into the thought explained in this work than <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to read the book
        twice</span></em>, and the first time with great patience, a patience
        which is only to be derived from the belief, voluntarily accorded,
        that the beginning presupposes the end almost as much as the end
        presupposes the beginning, and that all the earlier parts presuppose
        the later almost as much as the later presuppose the earlier. I say
        <span class="tei tei-q">“almost;”</span> for this is by no means
        absolutely the case, and I have honestly and conscientiously done all
        that was possible to give priority to that which stands least in need
        of explanation from what follows, as indeed generally to everything
        that can help to make the thought as easy to comprehend and as
        distinct as possible. This might indeed to a certain extent be
        achieved if it were not that the reader, as is very natural, thinks,
        as he reads, not merely of what is actually said, but also of its
        possible consequences, and thus besides the many contradictions
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pageix">[pg ix]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pgix"></a> actually given of the opinions of
        the time, and presumably of the reader, there may be added as many
        more which are anticipated and imaginary. That, then, which is really
        only misunderstanding, must take the form of active disapproval, and
        it is all the more difficult to recognise that it is
        misunderstanding, because although the laboriously-attained clearness
        of the explanation and distinctness of the expression never leaves
        the immediate sense of what is said doubtful, it cannot at the same
        time express its relations to all that remains to be said. Therefore,
        as we have said, the first perusal demands patience, founded on
        confidence that on a second perusal much, or all, will appear in an
        entirely different light. Further, the earnest endeavour to be more
        completely and even more easily comprehended in the case of a very
        difficult subject, must justify occasional repetition. Indeed the
        structure of the whole, which is organic, not a mere chain, makes it
        necessary sometimes to touch on the same point twice. Moreover this
        construction, and the very close connection of all the parts, has not
        left open to me the division into chapters and paragraphs which I
        should otherwise have regarded as very important, but has obliged me
        to rest satisfied with four principal divisions, as it were four
        aspects of one thought. In each of these four books it is especially
        important to guard against losing sight, in the details which must
        necessarily be discussed, of the principal thought to which they
        belong, and the progress of the whole exposition. I have thus
        expressed the first, and like those which follow, unavoidable demand
        upon the reader, who holds the philosopher in small favour just
        because he himself is a philosopher.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The second demand
        is this, that the introduction be <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagex">[pg x]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pgx"></a> read before the book itself, although it is not
        contained in the book, but appeared five years earlier under the
        title, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ueber die vierfache Wurzel des Satzes vom
        zureichenden Grunde: eine philosophische
        Abhandlung</span></span>”</span> (On the fourfold root of the
        principle of sufficient reason: a philosophical essay). Without an
        acquaintance with this introduction and propadeutic it is absolutely
        impossible to understand the present work properly, and the content
        of that essay will always be presupposed in this work just as if it
        were given with it. Besides, even if it had not preceded this book by
        several years, it would not properly have been placed before it as an
        introduction, but would have been incorporated in the first book. As
        it is, the first book does not contain what was said in the earlier
        essay, and it therefore exhibits a certain incompleteness on account
        of these deficiencies, which must always be supplied by reference to
        it. However, my disinclination was so great either to quote myself or
        laboriously to state again in other words what I had already said
        once in an adequate manner, that I preferred this course,
        notwithstanding the fact that I might now be able to give the content
        of that essay a somewhat better expression, chiefly by freeing it
        from several conceptions which resulted from the excessive influence
        which the Kantian philosophy had over me at the time, such
        as—categories, outer and inner sense, and the like. But even there
        these conceptions only occur because as yet I had never really
        entered deeply into them, therefore only by the way and quite out of
        connection with the principal matter. The correction of such passages
        in that essay will consequently take place of its own accord in the
        mind of the reader through his acquaintance with the present work.
        But only if we have fully recognised <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexi">[pg xi]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pgxi"></a> by means of that essay what the principle of
        sufficient reason is and signifies, what its validity extends to, and
        what it does not extend to, and that that principle is not before all
        things, and the whole world merely in consequence of it, and in
        conformity to it, a corollary, as it were, of it; but rather that it
        is merely the form in which the object, of whatever kind it may be,
        which is always conditioned by the subject, is invariably known so
        far as the subject is a knowing individual: only then will it be
        possible to enter into the method of philosophy which is here
        attempted for the first time, and which is completely different from
        all previous methods.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the same
        disinclination to repeat myself word for word, or to say the same
        thing a second time in other and worse words, after I have deprived
        myself of the better, has occasioned another defect in the first book
        of this work. For I have omitted all that is said in the first
        chapter of my essay <span class="tei tei-q">“On Sight and
        Colour,”</span> which would otherwise have found its place here, word
        for word. Therefore the knowledge of this short, earlier work is also
        presupposed.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Finally, the third
        demand I have to make on the reader might indeed be tacitly assumed,
        for it is nothing but an acquaintance with the most important
        phenomenon that has appeared in philosophy for two thousand years,
        and that lies so near us: I mean the principal writings of Kant. It
        seems to me, in fact, as indeed has already been said by others, that
        the effect these writings produce in the mind to which they truly
        speak is very like that of the operation for cataract on a blind man:
        and if we wish to pursue the simile further, the aim of my own work
        may be described by saying that I have sought to put into the hands
        of those upon whom that operation <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexii">[pg xii]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pgxii"></a> has been successfully performed a pair of
        spectacles suitable to eyes that have recovered their
        sight—spectacles of whose use that operation is the absolutely
        necessary condition. Starting then, as I do to a large extent, from
        what has been accomplished by the great Kant, I have yet been
        enabled, just on account of my earnest study of his writings, to
        discover important errors in them. These I have been obliged to
        separate from the rest and prove to be false, in order that I might
        be able to presuppose and apply what is true and excellent in his
        doctrine, pure and freed from error. But not to interrupt and
        complicate my own exposition by a constant polemic against Kant, I
        have relegated this to a special appendix. It follows then, from what
        has been said, that my work presupposes a knowledge of this appendix
        just as much as it presupposes a knowledge of the philosophy of Kant;
        and in this respect it would therefore be advisable to read the
        appendix first, all the more as its content is specially related to
        the first book of the present work. On the other hand, it could not
        be avoided, from the nature of the case, that here and there the
        appendix also should refer to the text of the work; and the only
        result of this is, that the appendix, as well as the principal part
        of the work, must be read twice.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The philosophy of
        Kant, then, is the only philosophy with which a thorough acquaintance
        is directly presupposed in what we have to say here. But if, besides
        this, the reader has lingered in the school of the divine Plato, he
        will be so much the better prepared to hear me, and susceptible to
        what I say. And if, indeed, in addition to this he is a partaker of
        the benefit conferred by the Vedas, the access to which, opened to us
        through the Upanishads, is in my eyes the greatest advantage which
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexiii">[pg xiii]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pgxiii"></a> this still young
        century enjoys over previous ones, because I believe that the
        influence of the Sanscrit literature will penetrate not less deeply
        than did the revival of Greek literature in the fifteenth century:
        if, I say, the reader has also already received and assimilated the
        sacred, primitive Indian wisdom, then is he best of all prepared to
        hear what I have to say to him. My work will not speak to him, as to
        many others, in a strange and even hostile tongue; for, if it does
        not sound too vain, I might express the opinion that each one of the
        individual and disconnected aphorisms which make up the Upanishads
        may be deduced as a consequence from the thought I am going to
        impart, though the converse, that my thought is to be found in the
        Upanishads, is by no means the case.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But most readers
        have already grown angry with impatience, and burst into reproaches
        with difficulty kept back so long. How can I venture to present a
        book to the public under conditions and demands the first two of
        which are presumptuous and altogether immodest, and this at a time
        when there is such a general wealth of special ideas, that in Germany
        alone they are made common property through the press, in three
        thousand valuable, original, and absolutely indispensable works every
        year, besides innumerable periodicals, and even daily papers; at a
        time when especially there is not the least deficiency of entirely
        original and profound philosophers, but in Germany alone there are
        more of them alive at the same time, than several centuries could
        formerly boast of in succession to each other? How is one ever to
        come to the end, asks the indignant reader, if one must set to work
        upon a book in such a fashion?</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexiv">[pg xiv]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pgxiv"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As I have
        absolutely nothing to advance against these reproaches, I only hope
        for some small thanks from such readers for having warned them in
        time, so that they may not lose an hour over a book which it would be
        useless to read without complying with the demands that have been
        made, and which should therefore be left alone, particularly as apart
        from this we might wager a great deal that it can say nothing to
        them, but rather that it will always be only <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">pancorum hominum</span></span>, and must
        therefore quietly and modestly wait for the few whose unusual mode of
        thought may find it enjoyable. For apart from the difficulties and
        the effort which it requires from the reader, what cultured man of
        this age, whose knowledge has almost reached the august point at
        which the paradoxical and the false are all one to it, could bear to
        meet thoughts almost on every page that directly contradict that
        which he has yet himself established once for all as true and
        undeniable? And then, how disagreeably disappointed will many a one
        be if he finds no mention here of what he believes it is precisely
        here he ought to look for, because his method of speculation agrees
        with that of a great living philosopher,<a href="#note_1" id="noteref_1" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1</span></span></a> who has
        certainly written pathetic books, and who only has the trifling
        weakness that he takes all he learned and approved before his
        fifteenth year for inborn ideas of the human mind. Who could stand
        all this? Therefore my advice is simply to lay down the book.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But I fear I shall
        not escape even thus. The reader who has got as far as the preface
        and been stopped by it, has bought the book for cash, and asks how he
        is to be indemnified. My last refuge is now to remind him that he
        knows how to make use of a book in several <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexv">[pg xv]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pgxv"></a> ways, without exactly reading it. It may fill a
        gap in his library as well as many another, where, neatly bound, it
        will certainly look well. Or he can lay it on the toilet-table or the
        tea-table of some learned lady friend. Or, finally, what certainly is
        best of all, and I specially advise it, he can review it.</p>
<div class="tei tei-tb">
<hr style="width: 50%">

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And now that I
        have allowed myself the jest to which in this two-sided life hardly
        any page can be too serious to grant a place, I part with the book
        with deep seriousness, in the sure hope that sooner or later it will
        reach those to whom alone it can be addressed; and for the rest,
        patiently resigned that the same fate should, in full measure, befall
        it, that in all ages has, to some extent, befallen all knowledge, and
        especially the weightiest knowledge of the truth, to which only a
        brief triumph is allotted between the two long periods in which it is
        condemned as paradoxical or disparaged as trivial. The former fate is
        also wont to befall its author. But life is short, and truth works
        far and lives long: let us speak the truth.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Not to my
        contemporaries, not to my compatriots—to mankind I commit my now
        completed work in the confidence that it will not be without value
        for them, even if this should be late recognised, as is commonly the
        lot of what is good. For it cannot have been for the passing
        generation, engrossed with the delusion of the moment, that my mind,
        almost against my will, has uninterruptedly stuck to its work through
        the course of a long life. And while the lapse of time has not been
        able to make me doubt the worth of my work, neither has the lack of
        sympathy; for I constantly saw the false and the bad, and finally the
        absurd and senseless,<a href="#note_2" id="noteref_2" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2</span></span></a> stand in
        universal admiration and honour, and I bethought myself that if it
        were not the case those who are capable of recognising the genuine
        and right are so rare that we may look for them in vain for some
        twenty years, then those who are capable of producing it could not be
        so few that their works afterwards form an exception to the
        perishableness of earthly things; and thus would be lost the reviving
        prospect of posterity which every one who sets before himself a high
        aim requires to strengthen him.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whoever seriously
        takes up and pursues an object that does not lead to material
        advantages, must not count on <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexviii">[pg xviii]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pgxviii"></a> the sympathy of his contemporaries. For the
        most part he will see, however, that in the meantime the superficial
        aspect of that object becomes current in the world, and enjoys its
        day; and this is as it should be. The object itself must be pursued
        for its own sake, otherwise it cannot be attained; for any design or
        intention is always dangerous to insight. Accordingly, as the whole
        history of literature proves, everything of real value required a
        long time to gain acceptance, especially if it belonged to the class
        of instructive, not entertaining, works; and meanwhile the false
        flourished. For to combine the object with its superficial appearance
        is difficult, when it is not impossible. Indeed that is just the
        curse of this world of want and need, that everything must serve and
        slave for these; and therefore it is not so constituted that any
        noble and sublime effort, like the endeavour after light and truth,
        can prosper unhindered and exist for its own sake. But even if such
        an endeavour has once succeeded in asserting itself, and the
        conception of it has thus been introduced, material interests and
        personal aims will immediately take possession of it, in order to
        make it their tool or their mask. Accordingly, when Kant brought
        philosophy again into repute, it had soon to become the tool of
        political aims from above, and personal aims from below; although,
        strictly speaking, not philosophy itself, but its ghost, that passes
        for it. This should not really astonish us; for the incredibly large
        majority of men are by nature quite incapable of any but material
        aims, indeed they can conceive no others. Thus the pursuit of truth
        alone is far too lofty and eccentric an endeavour for us to expect
        all or many, or indeed even a few, faithfully to take part in. If yet
        we see, as for example at present in Germany, a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexix">[pg xix]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pgxix"></a> remarkable activity, a general moving,
        writing, and talking with reference to philosophical subjects, we may
        confidently assume that, in spite of solemn looks and assurances,
        only real, not ideal aims, are the actual <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">primum mobile</span></span>, the concealed
        motive of such a movement; that it is personal, official,
        ecclesiastical, political, in short, material ends that are really
        kept in view, and consequently that mere party ends set the pens of
        so many pretended philosophers in such rapid motion. Thus some design
        or intention, not the desire of insight, is the guiding star of these
        disturbers of the peace, and truth is certainly the last thing that
        is thought of in the matter. It finds no partisans; rather, it may
        pursue its way as silently and unheeded through such a philosophical
        riot as through the winter night of the darkest century bound in the
        rigid faith of the church, when it was communicated only to a few
        alchemists as esoteric learning, or entrusted it may be only to the
        parchment. Indeed I might say that no time can be more unfavourable
        to philosophy than that in which it is shamefully misused, on the one
        hand to further political objects, on the other as a means of
        livelihood. Or is it believed that somehow, with such effort and such
        a turmoil, the truth, at which it by no means aims, will also be
        brought to light? Truth is no prostitute, that throws herself away
        upon those who do not desire her; she is rather so coy a beauty that
        he who sacrifices everything to her cannot even then be sure of her
        favour.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If Governments
        make philosophy a means of furthering political ends, learned men see
        in philosophical professorships a trade that nourishes the outer man
        just like any other; therefore they crowd after them in the assurance
        of their good intentions, that is, the purpose of subserving
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexx">[pg xx]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pgxx"></a> these ends. And they keep their
        word: not truth, not clearness, not Plato, not Aristotle, but the
        ends they were appointed to serve are their guiding star, and become
        at once the criterion of what is true, valuable, and to be respected,
        and of the opposites of these. Whatever, therefore, does not answer
        these ends, even if it were the most important and extraordinary
        things in their department, is either condemned, or, when this seems
        hazardous, suppressed by being unanimously ignored. Look only at
        their zeal against pantheism; will any simpleton believe that it
        proceeds from conviction? And, in general, how is it possible that
        philosophy, degraded to the position of a means of making one's
        bread, can fail to degenerate into sophistry? Just because this is
        infallibly the case, and the rule, <span class="tei tei-q">“I sing
        the song of him whose bread I eat,”</span> has always held good, the
        making of money by philosophy was regarded by the ancients as the
        characteristic of the sophists. But we have still to add this, that
        since throughout this world nothing is to be expected, can be
        demanded, or is to be had for gold but mediocrity, we must be
        contented with it here also. Consequently we see in all the German
        universities the cherished mediocrity striving to produce the
        philosophy which as yet is not there to produce, at its own expense
        and indeed in accordance with a predetermined standard and aim, a
        spectacle at which it would be almost cruel to mock.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While thus
        philosophy has long been obliged to serve entirely as a means to
        public ends on the one side and private ends on the other, I have
        pursued the course of my thought, undisturbed by them, for more than
        thirty years, and simply because I was obliged to do so and could not
        help myself, from an instinctive impulse, which <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxi">[pg xxi]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pgxxi"></a> was, however, supported by the confidence
        that anything true one may have thought, and anything obscure one may
        have thrown light upon, will appeal to any thinking mind, no matter
        when it comprehends it, and will rejoice and comfort it. To such an
        one we speak as those who are like us have spoken to us, and have so
        become our comfort in the wilderness of this life. Meanwhile the
        object is pursued on its own account and for its own sake. Now it
        happens curiously enough with philosophical meditations, that
        precisely that which one has thought out and investigated for
        oneself, is afterwards of benefit to others; not that, however, which
        was originally intended for others. The former is confessedly nearest
        in character to perfect honesty; for a man does not seek to deceive
        himself, nor does he offer himself empty husks; so that all
        sophistication and all mere talk is omitted, and consequently every
        sentence that is written at once repays the trouble of reading it.
        Thus my writings bear the stamp of honesty and openness so distinctly
        on the face of them, that by this alone they are a glaring contrast
        to those of three celebrated sophists of the post-Kantian period. I
        am always to be found at the standpoint of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">reflection</span></em>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
        rational deliberation and honest statement, never at that of
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">inspiration</span></em>, called intellectual
        intuition, or absolute thought; though, if it received its proper
        name, it would be called empty bombast and charlatanism. Working then
        in this spirit, and always seeing the false and bad in universal
        acceptance, yea, bombast<a href="#note_3" id="noteref_3" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3</span></span></a> and
        charlatanism<a href="#note_4" id="noteref_4" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">4</span></span></a> in the
        highest honour, I have long renounced the approbation of my
        contemporaries. It is impossible that an age which for twenty years
        has applauded a Hegel, that intellectual Caliban, as the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxii">[pg xxii]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pgxxii"></a> greatest of the philosophers, so
        loudly that it echoes through the whole of Europe, could make him who
        has looked on at that desirous of its approbation. It has no more
        crowns of honour to bestow; its applause is prostituted, and its
        censure has no significance. That I mean what I say is attested by
        the fact that if I had in any way sought the approbation of my
        contemporaries, I would have had to strike out a score of passages
        which entirely contradict all their opinions, and indeed must in part
        be offensive to them. But I would count it a crime to sacrifice a
        single syllable to that approbation. My guiding star has, in all
        seriousness, been truth. Following it, I could first aspire only to
        my own approbation, entirely averted from an age deeply degraded as
        regards all higher intellectual efforts, and a national literature
        demoralised even to the exceptions, a literature in which the art of
        combining lofty words with paltry significance has reached its
        height. I can certainly never escape from the errors and weaknesses
        which, in my case as in every one else's, necessarily belong to my
        nature; but I will not increase them by unworthy accommodations.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As regards this
        second edition, first of all I am glad to say that after five and
        twenty years I find nothing to retract; so that my fundamental
        convictions have only been confirmed, as far as concerns myself at
        least. The alterations in the first volume therefore, which contains
        the whole text of the first edition, nowhere touch what is essential.
        Sometimes they concern things of merely secondary importance, and
        more often consist of very short explanatory additions inserted here
        and there. Only the criticism of the Kantian philosophy has received
        important corrections and large additions, for these could not be put
        into a supplementary book, such as <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxiii">[pg xxiii]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pgxxiii"></a> those which are given in the second volume, and
        which correspond to each of the four books that contain the
        exposition of my own doctrine. In the case of the latter, I have
        chosen this form of enlarging and improving them, because the five
        and twenty years that have passed since they were composed have
        produced so marked a change in my method of exposition and in my
        style, that it would not have done to combine the content of the
        second volume with that of the first, as both must have suffered by
        the fusion. I therefore give both works separately, and in the
        earlier exposition, even in many places where I would now express
        myself quite differently, I have changed nothing, because I desired
        to guard against spoiling the work of my earlier years through the
        carping criticism of age. What in this regard might need correction
        will correct itself in the mind of the reader with the help of the
        second volume. Both volumes have, in the full sense of the word, a
        supplementary relation to each other, so far as this rests on the
        fact that one age of human life is, intellectually, the supplement of
        another. It will therefore be found, not only that each volume
        contains what the other lacks, but that the merits of the one consist
        peculiarly in that which is wanting in the other. Thus, if the first
        half of my work surpasses the second in what can only be supplied by
        the fire of youth and the energy of first conceptions, the second
        will surpass the first by the ripeness and complete elaboration of
        the thought which can only belong to the fruit of the labour of a
        long life. For when I had the strength originally to grasp the
        fundamental thought of my system, to follow it at once into its four
        branches, to return from them to the unity of their origin, and then
        to explain the whole distinctly, I could not yet be in a position to
        work out all <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxiv">[pg
        xxiv]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pgxxiv"></a>
        the branches of the system with the fulness, thoroughness, and
        elaborateness which is only reached by the meditation of many
        years—meditation which is required to test and illustrate the system
        by innumerable facts, to support it by the most different kinds of
        proof, to throw light on it from all sides, and then to place the
        different points of view boldly in contrast, to separate thoroughly
        the multifarious materials, and present them in a well-arranged
        whole. Therefore, although it would, no doubt, have been more
        agreeable to the reader to have my whole work in one piece, instead
        of consisting, as it now does, of two halves, which must be combined
        in using them, he must reflect that this would have demanded that I
        should accomplish at one period of life what it is only possible to
        accomplish in two, for I would have had to possess the qualities at
        one period of life that nature has divided between two quite
        different ones. Hence the necessity of presenting my work in two
        halves supplementary to each other may be compared to the necessity
        in consequence of which a chromatic object-glass, which cannot be
        made out of one piece, is produced by joining together a convex lens
        of flint glass and a concave lens of crown glass, the combined effect
        of which is what was sought. Yet, on the other hand, the reader will
        find some compensation for the inconvenience of using two volumes at
        once, in the variety and the relief which is afforded by the handling
        of the same subject, by the same mind, in the same spirit, but in
        very different years. However, it is very advisable that those who
        are not yet acquainted with my philosophy should first of all read
        the first volume without using the supplementary books, and should
        make use of these only on a second perusal; otherwise it would be too
        difficult for them to grasp the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxv">[pg xxv]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pgxxv"></a> system in its connection. For it is only thus
        explained in the first volume, while the second is devoted to a more
        detailed investigation and a complete development of the individual
        doctrines. Even those who should not make up their minds to a second
        reading of the first volume had better not read the second volume
        till after the first, and then for itself, in the ordinary sequence
        of its chapters, which, at any rate, stand in some kind of
        connection, though a somewhat looser one, the gaps of which they will
        fully supply by the recollection of the first volume, if they have
        thoroughly comprehended it. Besides, they will find everywhere the
        reference to the corresponding passages of the first volume, the
        paragraphs of which I have numbered in the second edition for this
        purpose, though in the first edition they were only divided by
        lines.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I have already
        explained in the preface to the first edition, that my philosophy is
        founded on that of Kant, and therefore presupposes a thorough
        knowledge of it. I repeat this here. For Kant's teaching produces in
        the mind of every one who has comprehended it a fundamental change
        which is so great that it may be regarded as an intellectual
        new-birth. It alone is able really to remove the inborn realism which
        proceeds from the original character of the intellect, which neither
        Berkeley nor Malebranche succeed in doing, for they remain too much
        in the universal, while Kant goes into the particular, and indeed in
        a way that is quite unexampled both before and after him, and which
        has quite a peculiar, and, we might say, immediate effect upon the
        mind in consequence of which it undergoes a complete undeception, and
        forthwith looks at all things in another light. Only in this way can
        any one become susceptible to the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxvi">[pg xxvi]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pgxxvi"></a> more positive expositions which I have to give.
        On the other hand, he who has not mastered the Kantian philosophy,
        whatever else he may have studied, is, as it were, in a state of
        innocence; that is to say, he remains in the grasp of that natural
        and childish realism in which we are all born, and which fits us for
        everything possible, with the single exception of philosophy. Such a
        man then stands to the man who knows the Kantian philosophy as a
        minor to a man of full age. That this truth should nowadays sound
        paradoxical, which would not have been the case in the first thirty
        years after the appearance of the Critique of Reason, is due to the
        fact that a generation has grown up that does not know Kant properly,
        because it has never heard more of him than a hasty, impatient
        lecture, or an account at second-hand; and this again is due to the
        fact that in consequence of bad guidance, this generation has wasted
        its time with the philosophemes of vulgar, uncalled men, or even of
        bombastic sophists, which are unwarrantably commended to it. Hence
        the confusion of fundamental conceptions, and in general the
        unspeakable crudeness and awkwardness that appears from under the
        covering of affectation and pretentiousness in the philosophical
        attempts of the generation thus brought up. But whoever thinks he can
        learn Kant's philosophy from the exposition of others makes a
        terrible mistake. Nay, rather I must earnestly warn against such
        accounts, especially the more recent ones; and indeed in the years
        just past I have met with expositions of the Kantian philosophy in
        the writings of the Hegelians which actually reach the incredible.
        How should the minds that in the freshness of youth have been
        strained and ruined by the nonsense of Hegelism, be still capable of
        following Kant's profound <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxvii">[pg
        xxvii]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pgxxvii"></a> investigations? They are early accustomed to
        take the hollowest jingle of words for philosophical thoughts, the
        most miserable sophisms for acuteness, and silly conceits for
        dialectic, and their minds are disorganised through the admission of
        mad combinations of words to which the mind torments and exhausts
        itself in vain to attach some thought. No Critique of Reason can
        avail them, no philosophy, they need a <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">medicina mentis</span></span>, first as a sort
        of purgative, <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">un petit cours de
        senscommunologie</span></span>, and then one must further see
        whether, in their case, there can even be any talk of philosophy. The
        Kantian doctrine then will be sought for in vain anywhere else but in
        Kant's own works; but these are throughout instructive, even where he
        errs, even where he fails. In consequence of his originality, it
        holds good of him in the highest degree, as indeed of all true
        philosophers, that one can only come to know them from their own
        works, not from the accounts of others. For the thoughts of any
        extraordinary intellect cannot stand being filtered through the
        vulgar mind. Born behind the broad, high, finely-arched brow, from
        under which shine beaming eyes, they lose all power and life, and
        appear no longer like themselves, when removed to the narrow lodging
        and low roofing of the confined, contracted, thick-walled skull from
        which dull glances steal directed to personal ends. Indeed we may say
        that minds of this kind act like an uneven glass, in which everything
        is twisted and distorted, loses the regularity of its beauty, and
        becomes a caricature. Only from their authors themselves can we
        receive philosophical thoughts; therefore whoever feels himself drawn
        to philosophy must himself seek out its immortal teachers in the
        still sanctuary of their works. The principal chapters of any one of
        these true philosophers will afford <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxviii">[pg xxviii]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pgxxviii"></a> a thousand times more insight into their
        doctrines than the heavy and distorted accounts of them that everyday
        men produce, who are still for the most part deeply entangled in the
        fashionable philosophy of the time, or in the sentiments of their own
        minds. But it is astonishing how decidedly the public seizes by
        preference on these expositions at second-hand. It seems really as if
        elective affinities were at work here, by virtue of which the common
        nature is drawn to its like, and therefore will rather hear what a
        great man has said from one of its own kind. Perhaps this rests on
        the same principle as that of mutual instruction, according to which
        children learn best from children.</p>
<div class="tei tei-tb">
<hr style="width: 50%">
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One word more for
        the professors of philosophy. I have always been compelled to admire
        not merely the sagacity, the true and fine tact with which,
        immediately on its appearance, they recognised my philosophy as
        something altogether different from and indeed dangerous to their own
        attempts, or, in popular language, something that would not suit
        their turn; but also the sure and astute policy by virtue of which
        they at once discovered the proper procedure with regard to it, the
        complete harmony with which they applied it, and the persistency with
        which they have remained faithful to it. This procedure, which
        further commended itself by the great ease of carrying it out,
        consists, as is well known, in altogether ignoring and thus in
        secreting—according to Goethe's malicious phrase, which just means
        the appropriating of what is of weight and significance. The
        efficiency of this quiet means is increased by the Corybantic shouts
        with which those who are at one reciprocally greet the birth of their
        own spiritual children—shouts which compel <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxix">[pg xxix]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pgxxix"></a> the public to look and note the air of
        importance with which they congratulate themselves on the event. Who
        can mistake the object of such proceedings? Is there then nothing to
        oppose to the maxim, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">primum vivere, deinde
        philosophari</span></span>? These gentlemen desire to live, and
        indeed to live by philosophy. To philosophy they are assigned with
        their wives and children, and in spite of Petrarch's <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">povera e nuda vai
        filosofia</span></span>, they have staked everything upon it. Now my
        philosophy is by no means so constituted that any one can live by it.
        It lacks the first indispensable requisite of a well-paid
        professional philosophy, a speculative theology, which—in spite of
        the troublesome Kant with his Critique of Reason—should and must, it
        is supposed, be the chief theme of all philosophy, even if it thus
        takes on itself the task of talking straight on of that of which it
        can know absolutely nothing. Indeed my philosophy does not permit to
        the professors the fiction they have so cunningly devised, and which
        has become so indispensable to them, of a reason that knows,
        perceives, or apprehends immediately and absolutely. This is a
        doctrine which it is only necessary to impose upon the reader at
        starting, in order to pass in the most comfortable manner in the
        world, as it were in a chariot and four, into that region beyond the
        possibility of all experience, which Kant has wholly and for ever
        shut out from our knowledge, and in which are found immediately
        revealed and most beautifully arranged the fundamental dogmas of
        modern, Judaising, optimistic Christianity. Now what in the world has
        my subtle philosophy, deficient as it is in these essential
        requisites, with no intentional aim, and unable to afford a means of
        subsistence, whose pole star is truth alone <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxx">[pg xxx]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pgxxx"></a> the naked, unrewarded, unbefriended, often
        persecuted truth, and which steers straight for it without looking to
        the right hand or the left,—what, I say, has this to do with that
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">alma
        mater</span></span>, the good, well-to-do university philosophy
        which, burdened with a hundred aims and a thousand motives, comes on
        its course cautiously tacking, while it keeps before its eyes at all
        times the fear of the Lord, the will of the ministry, the laws of the
        established church, the wishes of the publisher, the attendance of
        the students, the goodwill of colleagues, the course of current
        politics, the momentary tendency of the public, and Heaven knows what
        besides? Or what has my quiet, earnest search for truth in common
        with the noisy scholastic disputations of the chair and the benches,
        the inmost motives of which are always personal aims. The two kinds
        of philosophy are, indeed, radically different. Thus it is that with
        me there is no compromise and no fellowship, that no one reaps any
        benefit from my works but the man who seeks the truth alone, and
        therefore none of the philosophical parties of the day; for they all
        follow their own aims, while I have only insight into truth to offer,
        which suits none of these aims, because it is not modelled after any
        of them. If my philosophy is to become susceptible of professorial
        exposition, the times must entirely change. What a pretty thing it
        would be if a philosophy by which nobody could live were to gain for
        itself light and air, not to speak of the general ear! This must be
        guarded against, and all must oppose it as one man. But it is not
        just such an easy game to controvert and refute; and, moreover, these
        are mistaken means to employ, because they just direct the attention
        of the public to the matter, and its taste for the lucubrations
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxxi">[pg xxxi]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pgxxxi"></a> of the professors of
        philosophy might be destroyed by the perusal of my writings. For
        whoever has tasted of earnest will not relish jest, especially when
        it is tiresome. Therefore the silent system, so unanimously adopted,
        is the only right one, and I can only advise them to stick to it and
        go on with it as long as it will answer, that is, until to ignore is
        taken to imply ignorance; then there will just be time to turn back.
        Meanwhile it remains open to every one to pluck out a small feather
        here and there for his own use, for the superfluity of thoughts at
        home should not be very oppressive. Thus the ignoring and silent
        system may hold out a good while, at least the span of time I may
        have yet to live, whereby much is already won. And if, in the
        meantime, here and there an indiscreet voice has let itself be heard,
        it is soon drowned by the loud talking of the professors, who, with
        important airs, know how to entertain the public with very different
        things. I advise, however, that the unanimity of procedure should be
        somewhat more strictly observed, and especially that the young men
        should be looked after, for they are sometimes so fearfully
        indiscreet. For even so I cannot guarantee that the commended
        procedure will last for ever, and cannot answer for the final issue.
        It is a nice question as to the steering of the public, which, on the
        whole, is good and tractable. Although we nearly at all times see the
        Gorgiases and the Hippiases uppermost, although the absurd, as a
        rule, predominates, and it seems impossible that the voice of the
        individual can ever penetrate through the chorus of the befooling and
        the befooled, there yet remains to the genuine works of every age a
        quite peculiar, silent, slow, and powerful influence; and,
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxxii">[pg xxxii]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pgxxxii"></a> as if by a
        miracle, we see them rise at last out of the turmoil like a balloon
        that floats up out of the thick atmosphere of this globe into purer
        regions, where, having once arrived, it remains at rest, and no one
        can draw it down again.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 1.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“The world is my idea:”</span>—this is a
          truth which holds good for everything that lives and knows, though
          man alone can bring it into reflective and abstract consciousness.
          If he really does this, he has attained to philosophical wisdom. It
          then becomes clear and certain to him that what he knows is not a
          sun and an earth, but only an eye that sees a sun, a hand that
          feels an earth; that the world which surrounds him is there only as
          idea, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, only in relation to
          something else, the consciousness, which is himself. If any truth
          can be asserted <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span>, it is
          this: for it is the expression of the most general form of all
          possible and thinkable experience: a form which is more general
          than time, or space, or causality, for they all presuppose it; and
          each of these, which we have seen to be just so many modes of the
          principle of sufficient reason, is valid only for a particular
          class of ideas; whereas the antithesis of object and subject is the
          common form of all these classes, is that form under which alone
          any idea of whatever kind it may be, abstract or intuitive, pure or
          empirical, is possible and thinkable. No truth therefore is more
          certain, more independent of all others, and less in need of proof
          than this, that all that exists for knowledge, and therefore this
          whole world, is only object in relation to subject, perception of a
          perceiver, in a word, idea. This is obviously true of the past and
          the future, as well as of the present, of what is farthest off, as
          of what is near; for it is true of time and space themselves, in
          which alone these distinctions arise. All that in any way
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page004">[pg 004]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg004"></a> belongs or can
          belong to the world is inevitably thus conditioned through the
          subject, and exists only for the subject. The world is idea.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This truth is by
          no means new. It was implicitly involved in the sceptical
          reflections from which Descartes started. Berkeley, however, was
          the first who distinctly enunciated it, and by this he has rendered
          a permanent service to philosophy, even though the rest of his
          teaching should not endure. Kant's primary mistake was the neglect
          of this principle, as is shown in the appendix. How early again
          this truth was recognised by the wise men of India, appearing
          indeed as the fundamental tenet of the Vedânta philosophy ascribed
          to Vyasa, is pointed out by Sir William Jones in the last of his
          essays: <span class="tei tei-q">“On the philosophy of the
          Asiatics”</span> (Asiatic Researches, vol. iv. p. 164), where he
          says, <span class="tei tei-q">“The fundamental tenet of the Vedanta
          school consisted not in denying the existence of matter, that is,
          of solidity, impenetrability, and extended figure (to deny which
          would be lunacy), but in correcting the popular notion of it, and
          in contending that it has no essence independent of mental
          perception; that existence and perceptibility are convertible
          terms.”</span> These words adequately express the compatibility of
          empirical reality and transcendental ideality.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this first
          book, then, we consider the world only from this side, only so far
          as it is idea. The inward reluctance with which any one accepts the
          world as merely his idea, warns him that this view of it, however
          true it may be, is nevertheless one-sided, adopted in consequence
          of some arbitrary abstraction. And yet it is a conception from
          which he can never free himself. The defectiveness of this view
          will be corrected in the next book by means of a truth which is not
          so immediately certain as that from which we start here; a truth at
          which we can arrive only by deeper research and more severe
          abstraction, by the separation of what is different and the union
          of what is identical. This <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page005">[pg 005]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg005"></a> truth, which must be very serious and
          impressive if not awful to every one, is that a man can also say
          and must say, <span class="tei tei-q">“the world is my
          will.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this book,
          however, we must consider separately that aspect of the world from
          which we start, its aspect as knowable, and therefore, in the
          meantime, we must, without reserve, regard all presented objects,
          even our own bodies (as we shall presently show more fully), merely
          as ideas, and call them merely ideas. By so doing we always
          abstract from will (as we hope to make clear to every one further
          on), which by itself constitutes the other aspect of the world. For
          as the world is in one aspect entirely <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">idea</span></em>,
          so in another it is entirely <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em>. A reality which is neither
          of these two, but an object in itself (into which the thing in
          itself has unfortunately dwindled in the hands of Kant), is the
          phantom of a dream, and its acceptance is an <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ignis fatuus</span></span> in philosophy.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 2. That which
          knows all things and is known by none is the subject. Thus it is
          the supporter of the world, that condition of all phenomena, of all
          objects which is always pre-supposed throughout experience; for all
          that exists, exists only for the subject. Every one finds himself
          to be subject, yet only in so far as he knows, not in so far as he
          is an object of knowledge. But his body is object, and therefore
          from this point of view we call it idea. For the body is an object
          among objects, and is conditioned by the laws of objects, although
          it is an immediate object. Like all objects of perception, it lies
          within the universal forms of knowledge, time and space, which are
          the conditions of multiplicity. The subject, on the contrary, which
          is always the knower, never the known, does not come under these
          forms, but is presupposed by them; it has therefore neither
          multiplicity nor its opposite unity. We never know it, but it is
          always the knower wherever there is knowledge.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So then the
          world as idea, the only aspect in which <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page006">[pg 006]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg006"></a> we consider it at present, has two
          fundamental, necessary, and inseparable halves. The one half is the
          object, the forms of which are space and time, and through these
          multiplicity. The other half is the subject, which is not in space
          and time, for it is present, entire and undivided, in every
          percipient being. So that any one percipient being, with the
          object, constitutes the whole world as idea just as fully as the
          existing millions could do; but if this one were to disappear, then
          the whole world as idea would cease to be. These halves are
          therefore inseparable even for thought, for each of the two has
          meaning and existence only through and for the other, each appears
          with the other and vanishes with it. They limit each other
          immediately; where the object begins the subject ends. The
          universality of this limitation is shown by the fact that the
          essential and hence universal forms of all objects, space, time,
          and causality, may, without knowledge of the object, be discovered
          and fully known from a consideration of the subject, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          in Kantian language, they lie <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          priori</span></span> in our consciousness. That he discovered this
          is one of Kant's principal merits, and it is a great one. I however
          go beyond this, and maintain that the principle of sufficient
          reason is the general expression for all these forms of the object
          of which we are <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span>
          conscious; and that therefore all that we know purely <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span>, is merely the content
          of that principle and what follows from it; in it all our certain
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span> knowledge is expressed.
          In my essay on the principle of sufficient reason I have shown in
          detail how every possible object comes under it; that is, stands in
          a necessary relation to other objects, on the one side as
          determined, on the other side as determining: this is of such wide
          application, that the whole existence of all objects, so far as
          they are objects, ideas and nothing more, may be entirely traced to
          this their necessary relation to each other, rests only in it, is
          in fact merely relative; but of this more presently. I have further
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page007">[pg 007]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg007"></a> shown, that the
          necessary relation which the principle of sufficient reason
          expresses generally, appears in other forms corresponding to the
          classes into which objects are divided, according to their
          possibility; and again that by these forms the proper division of
          the classes is tested. I take it for granted that what I said in
          this earlier essay is known and present to the reader, for if it
          had not been already said it would necessarily find its place
          here.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 3. The chief
          distinction among our ideas is that between ideas of perception and
          abstract ideas. The latter form just one class of ideas, namely
          concepts, and these are the possession of man alone of all
          creatures upon earth. The capacity for these, which distinguishes
          him from all the lower animals, has always been called
          reason.<a href="#note_5" id="noteref_5" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">5</span></span></a> We
          shall consider these abstract ideas by themselves later, but, in
          the first place, we shall speak exclusively of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ideas of
          perception</span></em>. These comprehend the whole visible world,
          or the sum total of experience, with the conditions of its
          possibility. We have already observed that it is a highly important
          discovery of Kant's, that these very conditions, these forms of the
          visible world, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the absolutely universal
          element in its perception, the common property of all its
          phenomena, space and time, even when taken by themselves and apart
          from their content, can, not only be thought in the abstract, but
          also be directly perceived; and that this perception or intuition
          is not some kind of phantasm arising from constant recurrence in
          experience, but is so entirely independent of experience that we
          must rather regard the latter as dependent on it, inasmuch as the
          qualities of space and time, as they are known in <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span> perception or
          intuition, are valid for all possible experience, as rules to which
          it must invariably conform. Accordingly, in my <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page008">[pg 008]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg008"></a> essay on the principle of sufficient
          reason, I have treated space and time, because they are perceived
          as pure and empty of content, as a special and independent class of
          ideas. This quality of the universal forms of intuition, which was
          discovered by Kant, that they may be perceived in themselves and
          apart from experience, and that they may be known as exhibiting
          those laws on which is founded the infallible science of
          mathematics, is certainly very important. Not less worthy of
          remark, however, is this other quality of time and space, that the
          principle of sufficient reason, which conditions experience as the
          law of causation and of motive, and thought as the law of the basis
          of judgment, appears here in quite a special form, to which I have
          given the name of the ground of being. In time, this is the
          succession of its moments, and in space the position of its parts,
          which reciprocally determine each other <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ad
          infinitum</span></span>.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Any one who has
          fully understood from the introductory essay the complete identity
          of the content of the principle of sufficient reason in all its
          different forms, must also be convinced of the importance of the
          knowledge of the simplest of these forms, as affording him insight
          into his own inmost nature. This simplest form of the principle we
          have found to be time. In it each instant is, only in so far as it
          has effaced the preceding one, its generator, to be itself in turn
          as quickly effaced. The past and the future (considered apart from
          the consequences of their content) are empty as a dream, and the
          present is only the indivisible and unenduring boundary between
          them. And in all the other forms of the principle of sufficient
          reason, we shall find the same emptiness, and shall see that not
          time only but also space, and the whole content of both of them,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, all that proceeds from
          causes and motives, has a merely relative existence, is only
          through and for another like to itself, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          not more enduring. The substance of this doctrine is old: it
          appears in Heraclitus when he laments the eternal <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page009">[pg 009]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg009"></a> flux of things; in Plato when he
          degrades the object to that which is ever becoming, but never
          being; in Spinoza as the doctrine of the mere accidents of the one
          substance which is and endures. Kant opposes what is thus known as
          the mere phenomenon to the thing in itself. Lastly, the ancient
          wisdom of the Indian philosophers declares, <span class="tei tei-q">“It is Mâyâ, the veil of deception, which blinds the
          eyes of mortals, and makes them behold a world of which they cannot
          say either that it is or that it is not: for it is like a dream; it
          is like the sunshine on the sand which the traveller takes from
          afar for water, or the stray piece of rope he mistakes for a
          snake.”</span> (These similes are repeated in innumerable passages
          of the Vedas and the Puranas.) But what all these mean, and that of
          which they all speak, is nothing more than what we have just
          considered—the world as idea subject to the principle of sufficient
          reason.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 4. Whoever has
          recognised the form of the principle of sufficient reason, which
          appears in pure time as such, and on which all counting and
          arithmetical calculation rests, has completely mastered the nature
          of time. Time is nothing more than that form of the principle of
          sufficient reason, and has no further significance. Succession is
          the form of the principle of sufficient reason in time, and
          succession is the whole nature of time. Further, whoever has
          recognised the principle of sufficient reason as it appears in the
          presentation of pure space, has exhausted the whole nature of
          space, which is absolutely nothing more than that possibility of
          the reciprocal determination of its parts by each other, which is
          called position. The detailed treatment of this, and the
          formulation in abstract conceptions of the results which flow from
          it, so that they may be more conveniently used, is the subject of
          the science of geometry. Thus also, whoever has recognised the law
          of causation, the aspect of the principle of sufficient reason
          which appears in what fills these forms (space and time) as objects
          of perception, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page010">[pg
          010]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg010"></a>
          that is to say matter, has completely mastered the nature of matter
          as such, for matter is nothing more than causation, as any one will
          see at once if he reflects. Its true being is its action, nor can
          we possibly conceive it as having any other meaning. Only as active
          does it fill space and time; its action upon the immediate object
          (which is itself matter) determines that perception in which alone
          it exists. The consequence of the action of any material object
          upon any other, is known only in so far as the latter acts upon the
          immediate object in a different way from that in which it acted
          before; it consists only of this. Cause and effect thus constitute
          the whole nature of matter; its true being is its action. (A fuller
          treatment of this will be found in the essay on the Principle of
          Sufficient Reason, § 21, p. 77.) The nature of all material things
          is therefore very appropriately called in German <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">Wirklichkeit</span></span>,<a href="#note_6" id="noteref_6" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">6</span></span></a> a word
          which is far more expressive than <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">Realität</span></span>. Again, that which is
          acted upon is always matter, and thus the whole being and essence
          of matter consists in the orderly change, which one part of it
          brings about in another part. The existence of matter is therefore
          entirely relative, according to a relation which is valid only
          within its limits, as in the case of time and space.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But time and
          space, each for itself, can be mentally presented apart from
          matter, whereas matter cannot be so presented apart from time and
          space. The form which is inseparable from it presupposes space, and
          the action in which its very existence consists, always imports
          some change, in other words a determination in time. But space and
          time are not only, each for itself, presupposed by matter, but a
          union of the two constitutes its essence, for this, as we have
          seen, consists in action, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, in causation. All the
          innumerable conceivable phenomena and conditions of things, might
          be coexistent <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page011">[pg
          011]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg011"></a>
          in boundless space, without limiting each other, or might be
          successive in endless time without interfering with each other:
          thus a necessary relation of these phenomena to each other, and a
          law which should regulate them according to such a relation, is by
          no means needful, would not, indeed, be applicable: it therefore
          follows that in the case of all co-existence in space and change in
          time, so long as each of these forms preserves for itself its
          condition and its course without any connection with the other,
          there can be no causation, and since causation constitutes the
          essential nature of matter, there can be no matter. But the law of
          causation receives its meaning and necessity only from this, that
          the essence of change does not consist simply in the mere variation
          of things, but rather in the fact that at the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">same part of
          space</span></em> there is now <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one
          thing</span></em> and then <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">another</span></em>, and at <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> and
          the same point of time there is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">here</span></em>
          one thing and there <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">another</span></em>: only this reciprocal
          limitation of space and time by each other gives meaning, and at
          the same time necessity, to a law, according to which change must
          take place. What is determined by the law of causality is therefore
          not merely a succession of things in time, but this succession with
          reference to a definite space, and not merely existence of things
          in a particular place, but in this place at a different point of
          time. Change, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, variation which takes
          place according to the law of causality, implies always a
          determined part of space and a determined part of time together and
          in union. Thus causality unites space with time. But we found that
          the whole essence of matter consisted in action, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          in causation, consequently space and time must also be united in
          matter, that is to say, matter must take to itself at once the
          distinguishing qualities both of space and time, however much these
          may be opposed to each other, and must unite in itself what is
          impossible for each of these independently, that is, the fleeting
          course of time, with the rigid unchangeable perduration of
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page012">[pg 012]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg012"></a> space: infinite
          divisibility it receives from both. It is for this reason that we
          find that co-existence, which could neither be in time alone, for
          time has no contiguity, nor in space alone, for space has no
          before, after, or now, is first established through matter. But the
          co-existence of many things constitutes, in fact, the essence of
          reality, for through it permanence first becomes possible; for
          permanence is only knowable in the change of something which is
          present along with what is permanent, while on the other hand it is
          only because something permanent is present along with what
          changes, that the latter gains the special character of change,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the mutation of quality
          and form in the permanence of substance, that is to say, in
          matter.<a href="#note_7" id="noteref_7" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">7</span></span></a> If the
          world were in space alone, it would be rigid and immovable, without
          succession, without change, without action; but we know that with
          action, the idea of matter first appears. Again, if the world were
          in time alone, all would be fleeting, without persistence, without
          contiguity, hence without co-existence, and consequently without
          permanence; so that in this case also there would be no matter.
          Only through the union of space and time do we reach matter, and
          matter is the possibility of co-existence, and, through that, of
          permanence; through permanence again matter is the possibility of
          the persistence of substance in the change of its states.<a href="#note_8" id="noteref_8" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">8</span></span></a> As
          matter consists in the union of space and time, it bears throughout
          the stamp of both. It manifests its origin in space, partly through
          the form which is inseparable from it, but especially through its
          persistence (substance), the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          priori</span></span> certainty of which is therefore wholly
          deducible from that of space<a href="#note_9" id="noteref_9" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">9</span></span></a> (for
          variation belongs to time alone, but in it alone and for itself
          nothing is persistent). Matter shows that it springs <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page013">[pg 013]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg013"></a> from time by quality (accidents),
          without which it never exists, and which is plainly always
          causality, action upon other matter, and therefore change (a time
          concept). The law of this action, however, always depends upon
          space and time together, and only thus obtains meaning. The
          regulative function of causality is confined entirely to the
          determination of what must occupy <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">this time and this
          space</span></span>. The fact that we know <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          priori</span></span> the unalterable characteristics of matter,
          depends upon this derivation of its essential nature from the forms
          of our knowledge of which we are conscious <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          priori</span></span>. These unalterable characteristics are
          space-occupation, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, impenetrability,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, causal action,
          consequently, extension, infinite divisibility, persistence,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, indestructibility, and
          lastly mobility: weight, on the other hand, notwithstanding its
          universality, must be attributed to <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          posteriori</span></span> knowledge, although Kant, in his
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Metaphysical Introduction to Natural
          Philosophy,”</span> p. 71 (p. 372 of Rosenkranz's edition), treats
          it as knowable <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span>.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But as the
          object in general is only for the subject, as its idea, so every
          special class of ideas is only for an equally special quality in
          the subject, which is called a faculty of perception. This
          subjective correlative of time and space in themselves as empty
          forms, has been named by Kant pure sensibility; and we may retain
          this expression, as Kant was the first to treat of the subject,
          though it is not exact, for sensibility presupposes matter. The
          subjective correlative of matter or of causation, for these two are
          the same, is understanding, which is nothing more than this. To
          know causality is its one function, its only power; and it is a
          great one, embracing much, of manifold application, yet of
          unmistakable identity in all its manifestations. Conversely all
          causation, that is to say, all matter, or the whole of reality, is
          only for the understanding, through the understanding, and in the
          understanding. The first, simplest, and ever-present example of
          understanding is the perception of the actual <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page014">[pg 014]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg014"></a> world. This is throughout knowledge of
          the cause from the effect, and therefore all perception is
          intellectual. The understanding could never arrive at this
          perception, however, if some effect did not become known
          immediately, and thus serve as a starting-point. But this is the
          affection of the animal body. So far, then, the animal body is the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">immediate
          object</span></em> of the subject; the perception of all other
          objects becomes possible through it. The changes which every animal
          body experiences, are immediately known, that is, felt; and as
          these effects are at once referred to their causes, the perception
          of the latter as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">objects</span></em> arises. This relation is
          no conclusion in abstract conceptions; it does not arise from
          reflection, nor is it arbitrary, but immediate, necessary, and
          certain. It is the method of knowing of the pure understanding,
          without which there could be no perception; there would only remain
          a dull plant-like consciousness of the changes of the immediate
          object, which would succeed each other in an utterly unmeaning way,
          except in so far as they might have a meaning for the will either
          as pain or pleasure. But as with the rising of the sun the visible
          world appears, so at one stroke, the understanding, by means of its
          one simple function, changes the dull, meaningless sensation into
          perception. What the eye, the ear, or the hand feels, is not
          perception; it is merely its data. By the understanding passing
          from the effect to the cause, the world first appears as perception
          extended in space, varying in respect of form, persistent through
          all time in respect of matter; for the understanding unites space
          and time in the idea of matter, that is, causal action. As the
          world as idea exists only through the understanding, so also it
          exists only for the understanding. In the first chapter of my essay
          on <span class="tei tei-q">“Light and Colour,”</span> I have
          already explained how the understanding constructs perceptions out
          of the data supplied by the senses; how by comparison of the
          impressions which the various senses receive from the object, a
          child <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page015">[pg 015]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg015"></a> arrives at
          perceptions; how this alone affords the solution of so many
          phenomena of the senses; the single vision of two eyes, the double
          vision in the case of a squint, or when we try to look at once at
          objects which lie at unequal distances behind each other; and all
          illusion which is produced by a sudden alteration in the organs of
          sense. But I have treated this important subject much more fully
          and thoroughly in the second edition of the essay on <span class="tei tei-q">“The Principle of Sufficient Reason,”</span> § 21. All
          that is said there would find its proper place here, and would
          therefore have to be said again; but as I have almost as much
          disinclination to quote myself as to quote others, and as I am
          unable to explain the subject better than it is explained there, I
          refer the reader to it, instead of quoting it, and take for granted
          that it is known.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The process by
          which children, and persons born blind who have been operated upon,
          learn to see, the single vision of the double sensation of two
          eyes, the double vision and double touch which occur when the
          organs of sense have been displaced from their usual position, the
          upright appearance of objects while the picture on the retina is
          upside down, the attributing of colour to the outward objects,
          whereas it is merely an inner function, a division through
          polarisation, of the activity of the eye, and lastly the
          stereoscope,—all these are sure and incontrovertible evidence that
          perception is not merely of the senses, but intellectual—that is,
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pure
          knowledge through the understanding of the cause from the
          effect</span></em>, and that, consequently, it presupposes the law
          of causality, in a knowledge of which all perception—that is to say
          all experience, by virtue of its primary and only possibility,
          depends. The contrary doctrine that the law of causality results
          from experience, which was the scepticism of Hume, is first refuted
          by this. For the independence of the knowledge of causality of all
          experience,—that is, its <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          priori</span></span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page016">[pg
          016]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg016"></a>
          character—can only be deduced from the dependence of all experience
          upon it; and this deduction can only be accomplished by proving, in
          the manner here indicated, and explained in the passages referred
          to above, that the knowledge of causality is included in perception
          in general, to which all experience belongs, and therefore in
          respect of experience is completely <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          priori</span></span>, does not presuppose it, but is presupposed by
          it as a condition. This, however, cannot be deduced in the manner
          attempted by Kant, which I have criticised in the essay on
          <span class="tei tei-q">“The Principle of Sufficient
          Reason,”</span> § 23.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 5. It is
          needful to guard against the grave error of supposing that because
          perception arises through the knowledge of causality, the relation
          of subject and object is that of cause and effect. For this
          relation subsists only between the immediate object and objects
          known indirectly, thus always between objects alone. It is this
          false supposition that has given rise to the foolish controversy
          about the reality of the outer world; a controversy in which
          dogmatism and scepticism oppose each other, and the former appears,
          now as realism, now as idealism. Realism treats the object as
          cause, and the subject as its effect. The idealism of Fichte
          reduces the object to the effect of the subject. Since however, and
          this cannot be too much emphasised, there is absolutely no relation
          according to the principle of sufficient reason between subject and
          object, neither of these views could be proved, and therefore
          scepticism attacked them both with success. Now, just as the law of
          causality precedes perception and experience as their condition,
          and therefore cannot (as Hume thought) be derived from them, so
          object and subject precede all knowledge, and hence the principle
          of sufficient reason in general, as its first condition; for this
          principle is merely the form of all objects, the whole nature and
          possibility of their existence as phenomena: but the object always
          presupposes the subject; and therefore between these two
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page017">[pg 017]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg017"></a> there can be no
          relation of reason and consequent. My essay on the principle of
          sufficient reason accomplishes just this: it explains the content
          of that principle as the essential form of every object—that is to
          say, as the universal nature of all objective existence, as
          something which pertains to the object as such; but the object as
          such always presupposes the subject as its necessary correlative;
          and therefore the subject remains always outside the province in
          which the principle of sufficient reason is valid. The controversy
          as to the reality of the outer world rests upon this false
          extension of the validity of the principle of sufficient reason to
          the subject also, and starting with this mistake it can never
          understand itself. On the one side realistic dogmatism, looking
          upon the idea as the effect of the object, desires to separate
          these two, idea and object, which are really one, and to assume a
          cause quite different from the idea, an object in itself,
          independent of the subject, a thing which is quite inconceivable;
          for even as object it presupposes subject, and so remains its idea.
          Opposed to this doctrine is scepticism, which makes the same false
          presupposition that in the idea we have only the effect, never the
          cause, therefore never real being; that we always know merely the
          action of the object. But this object, it supposes, may perhaps
          have no resemblance whatever to its effect, may indeed have been
          quite erroneously received as the cause, for the law of causality
          is first to be gathered from experience, and the reality of
          experience is then made to rest upon it. Thus both of these views
          are open to the correction, firstly, that object and idea are the
          same; secondly, that the true being of the object of perception is
          its action, that the reality of the thing consists in this, and the
          demand for an existence of the object outside the idea of the
          subject, and also for an essence of the actual thing different from
          its action, has absolutely no meaning, and is a contradiction: and
          that the knowledge of the nature of the effect of any <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page018">[pg 018]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg018"></a> perceived object, exhausts such an
          object itself, so far as it is object, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          idea, for beyond this there is nothing more to be known. So far
          then, the perceived world in space and time, which makes itself
          known as causation alone, is entirely real, and is throughout
          simply what it appears to be, and it appears wholly and without
          reserve as idea, bound together according to the law of causality.
          This is its empirical reality. On the other hand, all causality is
          in the understanding alone, and for the understanding. The whole
          actual, that is, active world is determined as such through the
          understanding, and apart from it is nothing. This, however, is not
          the only reason for altogether denying such a reality of the outer
          world as is taught by the dogmatist, who explains its reality as
          its independence of the subject. We also deny it, because no object
          apart from a subject can be conceived without contradiction. The
          whole world of objects is and remains idea, and therefore wholly
          and for ever determined by the subject; that is to say, it has
          transcendental ideality. But it is not therefore illusion or mere
          appearance; it presents itself as that which it is, idea, and
          indeed as a series of ideas of which the common bond is the
          principle of sufficient reason. It is according to its inmost
          meaning quite comprehensible to the healthy understanding, and
          speaks a language quite intelligible to it. To dispute about its
          reality can only occur to a mind perverted by over-subtilty, and
          such discussion always arises from a false application of the
          principle of sufficient reason, which binds all ideas together of
          whatever kind they may be, but by no means connects them with the
          subject, nor yet with a something which is neither subject nor
          object, but only the ground of the object; an absurdity, for only
          objects can be and always are the ground of objects. If we examine
          more closely the source of this question as to the reality of the
          outer world, we find that besides the false application of the
          principle of sufficient reason generally to what lies <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page019">[pg 019]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg019"></a> beyond its province, a special
          confusion of its forms is also involved; for that form which it has
          only in reference to concepts or abstract ideas, is applied to
          perceived ideas, real objects; and a ground of knowing is demanded
          of objects, whereas they can have nothing but a ground of being.
          Among the abstract ideas, the concepts united in the judgment, the
          principle of sufficient reason appears in such a way that each of
          these has its worth, its validity, and its whole existence, here
          called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">truth</span></em>, simply and solely through
          the relation of the judgment to something outside of it, its ground
          of knowledge, to which there must consequently always be a return.
          Among real objects, ideas of perception, on the other hand, the
          principle of sufficient reason appears not as the principle of the
          ground of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">knowing</span></em>, but of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">being</span></em>,
          as the law of causality: every real object has paid its debt to it,
          inasmuch as it has come to be, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          has appeared as the effect of a cause. The demand for a ground of
          knowing has therefore here no application and no meaning, but
          belongs to quite another class of things. Thus the world of
          perception raises in the observer no question or doubt so long as
          he remains in contact with it: there is here neither error nor
          truth, for these are confined to the province of the abstract—the
          province of reflection. But here the world lies open for sense and
          understanding; presents itself with naive truth as that which it
          really is—ideas of perception which develop themselves according to
          the law of causality.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So far as we
          have considered the question of the reality of the outer world, it
          arises from a confusion which amounts even to a misunderstanding of
          reason itself, and therefore thus far, the question could be
          answered only by explaining its meaning. After examination of the
          whole nature of the principle of sufficient reason, of the relation
          of subject and object, and the special conditions of sense
          perception, the question itself disappeared because it had no
          longer any meaning. There <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page020">[pg
          020]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg020"></a>
          is, however, one other possible origin of this question, quite
          different from the purely speculative one which we have considered,
          a specially empirical origin, though the question is always raised
          from a speculative point of view, and in this form it has a much
          more comprehensible meaning than it had in the first. We have
          dreams; may not our whole life be a dream? or more exactly: is
          there a sure criterion of the distinction between dreams and
          reality? between phantasms and real objects? The assertion that
          what is dreamt is less vivid and distinct than what we actually
          perceive is not to the point, because no one has ever been able to
          make a fair comparison of the two; for we can only compare the
          recollection of a dream with the present reality. Kant answers the
          question thus: <span class="tei tei-q">“The connection of ideas
          among themselves, according to the law of causality, constitutes
          the difference between real life and dreams.”</span> But in dreams,
          as well as in real life, everything is connected individually at
          any rate, in accordance with the principle of sufficient reason in
          all its forms, and this connection is broken only between life and
          dreams, or between one dream and another. Kant's answer therefore
          could only run thus:—the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">long</span></em> dream (life) has throughout
          complete connection according to the principle of sufficient
          reason; it has not this connection, however, with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">short</span></em>
          dreams, although each of these has in itself the same connection:
          the bridge is therefore broken between the former and the latter,
          and on this account we distinguish them.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But to institute
          an inquiry according to this criterion, as to whether something was
          dreamt or seen, would always be difficult and often impossible. For
          we are by no means in a position to trace link by link the causal
          connection between any experienced event and the present moment,
          but we do not on that account explain it as dreamt. Therefore in
          real life we do not commonly employ that method of distinguishing
          between dreams and reality. The only sure criterion by which to
          distinguish <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page021">[pg
          021]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg021"></a>
          them is in fact the entirely empirical one of awaking, through
          which at any rate the causal connection between dreamed events and
          those of waking life, is distinctly and sensibly broken off. This
          is strongly supported by the remark of Hobbes in the second chapter
          of Leviathan, that we easily mistake dreams for reality if we have
          unintentionally fallen asleep without taking off our clothes, and
          much more so when it also happens that some undertaking or design
          fills all our thoughts, and occupies our dreams as well as our
          waking moments. We then observe the awaking just as little as the
          falling asleep, dream and reality run together and become
          confounded. In such a case there is nothing for it but the
          application of Kant's criterion; but if, as often happens, we fail
          to establish by means of this criterion, either the existence of
          causal connection with the present, or the absence of such
          connection, then it must for ever remain uncertain whether an event
          was dreamt or really happened. Here, in fact, the intimate
          relationship between life and dreams is brought out very clearly,
          and we need not be ashamed to confess it, as it has been recognised
          and spoken of by many great men. The Vedas and Puranas have no
          better simile than a dream for the whole knowledge of the actual
          world, which they call the web of Mâyâ, and they use none more
          frequently. Plato often says that men live only in a dream; the
          philosopher alone strives to awake himself. Pindar says (ii. η.
          135): σκιας οναρ ανθρωπος (umbræ somnium homo), and Sophocles:—</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lastly, Calderon
          was so deeply impressed with this view of life that he sought to
          embody it in a kind of metaphysical drama—<span class="tei tei-q">“Life a Dream.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After these
          numerous quotations from the poets, perhaps I also may be allowed
          to express myself by a metaphor. Life and dreams are leaves of the
          same book. The systematic reading of this book is real life, but
          when the reading hours (that is, the day) are over, we often
          continue idly to turn over the leaves, and read a page here and
          there without method or connection: often one we have read before,
          sometimes one that is new to us, but always in the same book. Such
          an isolated page is indeed out of connection with the systematic
          study of the book, but it does not seem so very different when we
          remember that the whole continuous perusal begins and ends just as
          abruptly, and may therefore be regarded as merely a larger single
          page.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus although
          individual dreams are distinguished from real life by the fact that
          they do not fit into that continuity which runs through the whole
          of experience, and the act of awaking brings this into
          consciousness, yet that very continuity of experience belongs to
          real life as its form, and the dream on its part can point to a
          similar continuity in itself. If, therefore, we consider the
          question from a point of view external to both, there is no
          distinct difference in their nature, and we are forced to concede
          to the poets that life is a long dream.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Let us turn back
          now from this quite independent empirical origin of the question of
          the reality of the outer world, to its speculative origin. We found
          that this consisted, first, in the false application of the
          principle of sufficient reason to the relation of subject and
          object; and secondly, in the confusion of its forms, inasmuch as
          the principle of sufficient reason of knowing was extended to a
          province in which the principle of sufficient reason of being is
          valid. But the question could hardly have occupied philosophers so
          constantly if it <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page023">[pg
          023]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg023"></a>
          were entirely devoid of all real content, and if some true thought
          and meaning did not lie at its heart as its real source.
          Accordingly, we must assume that when the element of truth that
          lies at the bottom of the question first came into reflection and
          sought its expression, it became involved in these confused and
          meaningless forms and problems. This at least is my opinion, and I
          think that the true expression of that inmost meaning of the
          question, which it failed to find, is this:—What is this world of
          perception besides being my idea? Is that of which I am conscious
          only as idea, exactly like my own body, of which I am doubly
          conscious, in one aspect as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">idea</span></em>, in another aspect as
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em>? The fuller explanation of
          this question and its answer in the affirmative, will form the
          content of the second book, and its consequences will occupy the
          remaining portion of this work.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 6. For the
          present, however, in this first book we consider everything merely
          as idea, as object for the subject. And our own body, which is the
          starting-point for each of us in our perception of the world, we
          consider, like all other real objects, from the side of its
          knowableness, and in this regard it is simply an idea. Now the
          consciousness of every one is in general opposed to the explanation
          of objects as mere ideas, and more especially to the explanation of
          our bodies as such; for the thing in itself is known to each of us
          immediately in so far as it appears as our own body; but in so far
          as it objectifies itself in the other objects of perception, it is
          known only indirectly. But this abstraction, this one-sided
          treatment, this forcible separation of what is essentially and
          necessarily united, is only adopted to meet the demands of our
          argument; and therefore the disinclination to it must, in the
          meantime, be suppressed and silenced by the expectation that the
          subsequent treatment will correct the one-sidedness of the present
          one, and complete our knowledge of the nature of the world.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At present
          therefore the body is for us immediate <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page024">[pg 024]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg024"></a> object; that is to say, that idea which forms
          the starting-point of the subject's knowledge; because the body,
          with its immediately known changes, precedes the application of the
          law of causality, and thus supplies it with its first data. The
          whole nature of matter consists, as we have seen, in its causal
          action. But cause and effect exist only for the understanding,
          which is nothing but their subjective correlative. The
          understanding, however, could never come into operation if there
          were not something else from which it starts. This is simple
          sensation—the immediate consciousness of the changes of the body,
          by virtue of which it is immediate object. Thus the possibility of
          knowing the world of perception depends upon two conditions; the
          first, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">objectively expressed</span></em>, is the
          power of material things to act upon each other, to produce changes
          in each other, without which common quality of all bodies no
          perception would be possible, even by means of the sensibility of
          the animal body. And if we wish to express this condition
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">subjectively</span></em> we say: The
          understanding first makes perception possible; for the law of
          causality, the possibility of effect and cause, springs only from
          the understanding, and is valid only for it, and therefore the
          world of perception exists only through and for it. The second
          condition is the sensibility of animal bodies, or the quality of
          being immediate objects of the subject which certain bodies
          possess. The mere modification which the organs of sense sustain
          from without through their specific affections, may here be called
          ideas, so far as these affections produce neither pain nor
          pleasure, that is, have no immediate significance for the will, and
          are yet perceived, exist therefore only for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">knowledge</span></em>. Thus far, then, I say
          that the body is immediately <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">known</span></em>, is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">immediate
          object</span></em>. But the conception of object is not to be taken
          here in its fullest sense, for through this immediate knowledge of
          the body, which precedes the operation of the understanding, and is
          mere sensation, our own body does not exist <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page025">[pg 025]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg025"></a> specifically as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">object</span></em>,
          but first the material things which affect it: for all knowledge of
          an object proper, of an idea perceived in space, exists only
          through and for the understanding; therefore not before, but only
          subsequently to its operation. Therefore the body as object proper,
          that is, as an idea perceived in space, is first known indirectly,
          like all other objects, through the application of the law of
          causality to the action of one of its parts upon another, as, for
          example, when the eye sees the body or the hand touches it.
          Consequently the form of our body does not become known to us
          through mere feeling, but only through knowledge, only in idea;
          that is to say, only in the brain does our own body first come to
          appear as extended, articulate, organic. A man born blind receives
          this idea only little by little from the data afforded by touch. A
          blind man without hands could never come to know his own form; or
          at the most could infer and construct it little by little from the
          effects of other bodies upon him. If, then, we call the body an
          immediate object, we are to be understood with these
          reservations.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In other
          respects, then, according to what has been said, all animal bodies
          are immediate objects; that is, starting-points for the subject
          which always knows and therefore is never known in its perception
          of the world. Thus the distinctive characteristic of animal life is
          knowledge, with movement following on motives, which are determined
          by knowledge, just as movement following on stimuli is the
          distinctive characteristic of plant-life. Unorganised matter,
          however, has no movement except such as is produced by causes
          properly so called, using the term in its narrowest sense. All this
          I have thoroughly discussed in my essay on the principle of
          sufficient reason, § 20, in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Ethics,”</span> first essay, iii., and in my work on
          Sight and Colour, § 1, to which I therefore refer.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It follows from
          what has been said, that all animals, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page026">[pg 026]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg026"></a> even the least developed, have understanding;
          for they all know objects, and this knowledge determines their
          movements as motive. Understanding is the same in all animals and
          in all men; it has everywhere the same simple form; knowledge of
          causality, transition from effect to cause, and from cause to
          effect, nothing more; but the degree of its acuteness, and the
          extension of the sphere of its knowledge varies enormously, with
          innumerable gradations from the lowest form, which is only
          conscious of the causal connection between the immediate object and
          objects affecting it—that is to say, perceives a cause as an object
          in space by passing to it from the affection which the body feels,
          to the higher grades of knowledge of the causal connection among
          objects known indirectly, which extends to the understanding of the
          most complicated system of cause and effect in nature. For even
          this high degree of knowledge is still the work of the
          understanding, not of the reason. The abstract concepts of the
          reason can only serve to take up the objective connections which
          are immediately known by the understanding, to make them permanent
          for thought, and to relate them to each other; but reason never
          gives us immediate knowledge. Every force and law of nature, every
          example of such forces and laws, must first be immediately known by
          the understanding, must be apprehended through perception before it
          can pass into abstract consciousness for reason. Hooke's discovery
          of the law of gravitation, and the reference of so many important
          phenomena to this one law, was the work of immediate apprehension
          by the understanding; and such also was the proof of Newton's
          calculations, and Lavoisier's discovery of acids and their
          important function in nature, and also Goethe's discovery of the
          origin of physical colours. All these discoveries are nothing more
          than a correct immediate passage from the effect to the cause,
          which is at once followed by the recognition of the ideality of the
          force of nature which expresses itself in all <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page027">[pg 027]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg027"></a> causes of the same kind; and this
          complete insight is just an example of that single function of the
          understanding, by which an animal perceives as an object in space
          the cause which affects its body, and differs from such a
          perception only in degree. Every one of these great discoveries is
          therefore, just like perception, an operation of the understanding,
          an immediate intuition, and as such the work of an instant, an
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">apperçu</span></span>, a flash of insight.
          They are not the result of a process of abstract reasoning, which
          only serves to make the immediate knowledge of the understanding
          permanent for thought by bringing it under abstract concepts,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, it makes knowledge
          distinct, it puts us in a position to impart it and explain it to
          others. The keenness of the understanding in apprehending the
          causal relations of objects which are known indirectly, does not
          find its only application in the sphere of natural science (though
          all the discoveries in that sphere are due to it), but it also
          appears in practical life. It is then called good sense or
          prudence, as in its other application it is better called
          acuteness, penetration, sagacity. More exactly, good sense or
          prudence signifies exclusively understanding at the command of the
          will. But the limits of these conceptions must not be too sharply
          defined, for it is always that one function of the understanding by
          means of which all animals perceive objects in space, which, in its
          keenest form, appears now in the phenomena of nature, correctly
          inferring the unknown causes from the given effects, and providing
          the material from which the reason frames general rules as laws of
          nature; now inventing complicated and ingenious machines by
          adapting known causes to desired effects; now in the sphere of
          motives, seeing through and frustrating intrigues and machinations,
          or fitly disposing the motives and the men who are susceptible to
          them, setting them in motion, as machines are moved by levers and
          wheels, and directing them at will to the accomplishment of its
          ends. Deficiency of understanding is called <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page028">[pg 028]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg028"></a> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">stupidity</span></em>. It is just <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dulness in applying
          the law of causality</span></em>, incapacity for the immediate
          apprehension of the concatenations of causes and effects, motives
          and actions. A stupid person has no insight into the connection of
          natural phenomena, either when they follow their own course, or
          when they are intentionally combined, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          are applied to machinery. Such a man readily believes in magic and
          miracles. A stupid man does not observe that persons, who
          apparently act independently of each other, are really in
          collusion; he is therefore easily mystified, and outwitted; he does
          not discern the hidden motives of proffered advice or expressions
          of opinion, &amp;c. But it is always just one thing that he
          lacks—keenness, rapidity, ease in applying the law of causality,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, power of understanding.
          The greatest, and, in this reference, the most instructive example
          of stupidity I ever met with, was the case of a totally imbecile
          boy of about eleven years of age, in an asylum. He had reason,
          because he spoke and comprehended, but in respect of understanding
          he was inferior to many of the lower animals. Whenever I visited
          him he noticed an eye-glass which I wore round my neck, and in
          which the window of the room and the tops of the trees beyond were
          reflected: on every occasion he was greatly surprised and delighted
          with this, and was never tired of looking at it with astonishment,
          because he did not understand the immediate causation of
          reflection.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While the
          difference in degree of the acuteness of the understanding, is very
          great between man and man, it is even greater between one species
          of animal and another. In all species of animals, even those which
          are nearest to plants, there is at least as much understanding as
          suffices for the inference from the effect on the immediate object,
          to the indirectly known object as its cause, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          sufficient for perception, for the apprehension of an object. For
          it is this that constitutes them animals, as it gives them the
          power of movement following on motives, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page029">[pg 029]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg029"></a> thereby the power of seeking for food,
          or at least of seizing it; whereas plants have only movement
          following on stimuli, whose direct influence they must await, or
          else decay, for they cannot seek after them nor appropriate them.
          We marvel at the great sagacity of the most developed species of
          animals, such as the dog, the elephant, the monkey or the fox,
          whose cleverness has been so admirably sketched by Buffon. From
          these most sagacious animals, we can pretty accurately determine
          how far understanding can go without reason, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          abstract knowledge embodied in concepts. We could not find this out
          from ourselves, for in us understanding and reason always
          reciprocally support each other. We find that the manifestation of
          understanding in animals is sometimes above our expectation, and
          sometimes below it. On the one hand, we are surprised at the
          sagacity of the elephant, who, after crossing many bridges during
          his journey in Europe, once refused to go upon one, because he
          thought it was not strong enough to bear his weight, though he saw
          the rest of the party, consisting of men and horses, go upon it as
          usual. On the other hand, we wonder that the intelligent
          Orang-outangs, who warm themselves at a fire they have found, do
          not keep it alight by throwing wood on it; a proof that this
          requires a deliberation which is not possible without abstract
          concepts. It is clear that the knowledge of cause and effect, as
          the universal form of understanding, belongs to all animals
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span>, because to them as to
          us it is the prior condition of all perception of the outer world.
          If any one desires additional proof of this, let him observe, for
          example, how a young dog is afraid to jump down from a table,
          however much he may wish to do so, because he foresees the effect
          of the weight of his body, though he has not been taught this by
          experience. In judging of the understanding of animals, we must
          guard against ascribing to it the manifestations of instinct, a
          faculty which is quite distinct both from understanding and
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page030">[pg 030]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg030"></a> reason, but the
          action of which is often very analogous to the combined action of
          the two. We cannot, however, discuss this here; it will find its
          proper place in the second book, when we consider the harmony or
          so-called teleology of nature: and the 27th chapter of the
          supplementary volume is expressly devoted to it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Deficiency of
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">understanding</span></em> we call <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">stupidity</span></em>: deficiency in the
          application of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">reason</span></em> to practice we shall
          recognise later as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">foolishness</span></em>: deficiency of
          judgment as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">silliness</span></em>, and lastly, partial or
          entire deficiency of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">memory</span></em> as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">madness</span></em>. But each of these will be
          considered in its own place. That which is correctly known by
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">reason</span></em> is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">truth</span></em>,
          that is, an abstract judgment on sufficient grounds (Essay on the
          Principle of Sufficient Reason, § 29 and following paragraphs);
          that which is correctly known by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">understanding</span></em> is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">reality</span></em>, that is correct inference
          from effect on the immediate object to its cause. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Error</span></em>
          is opposed to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">truth</span></em>, as deception of the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">reason</span></em>: <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">illusion</span></em> is opposed to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">reality</span></em>, as deception of the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">understanding</span></em>. The full discussion
          of all this will be found in the first chapter of my essay on Light
          and Colour. Illusion takes place when the same effect may be
          attributed to two causes, of which one occurs very frequently, the
          other very seldom; the understanding having no data to decide which
          of these two causes operates in any particular case,—for their
          effects are exactly alike,—always assumes the presence of the
          commoner cause, and as the activity of the understanding is not
          reflective and discursive, but direct and immediate, this false
          cause appears before us as a perceived object, whereas it is merely
          illusion. I have explained in the essay referred to, how in this
          way double sight and double feeling take place if the organs of
          sense are brought into an unusual position; and have thus given an
          incontrovertible proof that perception exists only through and for
          the understanding. As additional examples of such illusions or
          deceptions of the understanding, we may mention the broken
          appearance <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page031">[pg
          031]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg031"></a>
          of a stick dipped in water; the reflections in spherical mirrors,
          which, when the surface is convex appear somewhat behind it, and
          when the surface is concave appear a long way in front of it. To
          this class also belongs the apparently greater extension of the
          moon at the horizon than at the zenith. This appearance is not
          optical, for as the micrometre proves, the eye receives the image
          of the moon at the zenith, at an even greater angle of vision than
          at the horizon. The mistake is due to the understanding, which
          assumes that the cause of the feebler light of the moon and of all
          stars at the horizon is that they are further off, thus treating
          them as earthly objects, according to the laws of atmospheric
          perspective, and therefore it takes the moon to be much larger at
          the horizon than at the zenith, and also regards the vault of
          heaven as more extended or flattened out at the horizon. The same
          false application of the laws of atmospheric perspective leads us
          to suppose that very high mountains, whose summits alone are
          visible in pure transparent air, are much nearer than they really
          are, and therefore not so high as they are; for example, Mont Blanc
          seen from Salenche. All such illusions are immediately present to
          us as perceptions, and cannot be dispelled by any arguments of the
          reason. Reason can only prevent error, that is, a judgment on
          insufficient grounds, by opposing to it a truth; as for example,
          the abstract knowledge that the cause of the weaker light of the
          moon and the stars at the horizon is not greater distance, but the
          denser atmosphere; but in all the cases we have referred to, the
          illusion remains in spite of every abstract explanation. For the
          understanding is in itself, even in the case of man, irrational,
          and is completely and sharply distinguished from the reason, which
          is a faculty of knowledge that belongs to man alone. The reason can
          only <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">know</span></em>; perception remains free from
          its influence and belongs to the understanding alone.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 7. With
          reference to our exposition up to this point, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page032">[pg 032]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg032"></a> it must be observed that we did not
          start either from the object or the subject, but from the idea,
          which contains and presupposes them both; for the antithesis of
          object and subject is its primary, universal and essential form. We
          have therefore first considered this form as such; then (though in
          this respect reference has for the most part been made to the
          introductory essay) the subordinate forms of time, space and
          causality. The latter belong exclusively to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">object</span></em>,
          and yet, as they are essential to the object <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as
          such</span></em>, and as the object again is essential to the
          subject <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as such</span></em>, they may be discovered
          from the subject, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, they may be known
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span>, and so far they are to
          be regarded as the common limits of both. But all these forms may
          be referred to one general expression, the principle of sufficient
          reason, as we have explained in the introductory essay.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This procedure
          distinguishes our philosophical method from that of all former
          systems. For they all start either from the object or from the
          subject, and therefore seek to explain the one from the other, and
          this according to the principle of sufficient reason. We, on the
          contrary, deny the validity of this principle with reference to the
          relation of subject and object, and confine it to the object. It
          may be thought that the philosophy of identity, which has appeared
          and become generally known in our own day, does not come under
          either of the alternatives we have named, for it does not start
          either from the subject or from the object, but from the absolute,
          known through <span class="tei tei-q">“intellectual
          intuition,”</span> which is neither object nor subject, but the
          identity of the two. I will not venture to speak of this revered
          identity, and this absolute, for I find myself entirely devoid of
          all <span class="tei tei-q">“intellectual intuition.”</span> But as
          I take my stand merely on those manifestoes of the <span class="tei tei-q">“intellectual intuiter”</span> which are open to all,
          even to profane persons like myself, I must yet observe that this
          philosophy is not to be excepted from the alternative errors
          mentioned above. For it does not escape these <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page033">[pg 033]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg033"></a> two opposite errors in spite of its
          identity of subject and object, which is not thinkable, but only
          <span class="tei tei-q">“intellectually intuitable,”</span> or to
          be experienced by a losing of oneself in it. On the contrary, it
          combines them both in itself; for it is divided into two parts,
          firstly, transcendental idealism, which is just Fichte's doctrine
          of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ego</span></em>, and therefore teaches that
          the object is produced by the subject, or evolved out of it in
          accordance with the principle of sufficient reason; secondly, the
          philosophy of nature, which teaches that the subject is produced
          little by little from the object, by means of a method called
          construction, about which I understand very little, yet enough to
          know that it is a process according to various forms of the
          principle of sufficient reason. The deep wisdom itself which that
          construction contains, I renounce; for as I entirely lack
          <span class="tei tei-q">“intellectual intuition,”</span> all those
          expositions which presuppose it must for me remain as a book sealed
          with seven seals. This is so truly the case that, strange to say, I
          have always been unable to find anything at all in this doctrine of
          profound wisdom but atrocious and wearisome bombast.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The systems
          starting from the object had always the whole world of perception
          and its constitution as their problem; yet the object which they
          take as their starting-point is not always this whole world of
          perception, nor its fundamental element, matter. On the contrary, a
          division of these systems may be made, based on the four classes of
          possible objects set forth in the introductory essay. Thus Thales
          and the Ionic school, Democritus, Epicurus, Giordano Bruno, and the
          French materialists, may be said to have started from the first
          class of objects, the real world: Spinoza (on account of his
          conception of substance, which is purely abstract, and exists only
          in his definition) and, earlier, the Eleatics, from the second
          class, the abstract conception: the Pythagoreans and Chinese
          philosophy in Y-King, from the third class, time, and consequently
          number: and, lastly, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page034">[pg
          034]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg034"></a>
          the schoolmen, who teach a creation out of nothing by the act of
          will of an extra-mundane personal being, started from the fourth
          class of objects, the act of will directed by knowledge.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of all systems
          of philosophy which start from the object, the most consistent, and
          that which may be carried furthest, is simple materialism. It
          regards matter, and with it time and space, as existing absolutely,
          and ignores the relation to the subject in which alone all this
          really exists. It then lays hold of the law of causality as a
          guiding principle or clue, regarding it as a self-existent order
          (or arrangement) of things, <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">veritas
          aeterna</span></span>, and so fails to take account of the
          understanding, in which and for which alone causality is. It seeks
          the primary and most simple state of matter, and then tries to
          develop all the others from it; ascending from mere mechanism, to
          chemism, to polarity, to the vegetable and to the animal kingdom.
          And if we suppose this to have been done, the last link in the
          chain would be animal sensibility—that is knowledge—which would
          consequently now appear as a mere modification or state of matter
          produced by causality. Now if we had followed materialism thus far
          with clear ideas, when we reached its highest point we would
          suddenly be seized with a fit of the inextinguishable laughter of
          the Olympians. As if waking from a dream, we would all at once
          become aware that its final result—knowledge, which it reached so
          laboriously, was presupposed as the indispensable condition of its
          very starting-point, mere matter; and when we imagined that we
          thought matter, we really thought only the subject that perceives
          matter; the eye that sees it, the hand that feels it, the
          understanding that knows it. Thus the tremendous <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">petitio principii</span></span> reveals itself
          unexpectedly; for suddenly the last link is seen to be the
          starting-point, the chain a circle, and the materialist is like
          Baron Münchausen who, when swimming in water on horseback, drew the
          horse into the air with his legs, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page035">[pg 035]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg035"></a> and himself also by his cue. The fundamental
          absurdity of materialism is that it starts from the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">objective</span></em>, and takes as the
          ultimate ground of explanation something <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">objective</span></em>, whether it be matter in
          the abstract, simply as it is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thought</span></em>, or after it has taken
          form, is empirically given—that is to say, is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">substance</span></em>, the chemical element
          with its primary relations. Some such thing it takes, as existing
          absolutely and in itself, in order that it may evolve organic
          nature and finally the knowing subject from it, and explain them
          adequately by means of it; whereas in truth all that is objective
          is already determined as such in manifold ways by the knowing
          subject through its forms of knowing, and presupposes them; and
          consequently it entirely disappears if we think the subject away.
          Thus materialism is the attempt to explain what is immediately
          given us by what is given us indirectly. All that is objective,
          extended, active—that is to say, all that is material—is regarded
          by materialism as affording so solid a basis for its explanation,
          that a reduction of everything to this can leave nothing to be
          desired (especially if in ultimate analysis this reduction should
          resolve itself into action and reaction). But we have shown that
          all this is given indirectly and in the highest degree determined,
          and is therefore merely a relatively present object, for it has
          passed through the machinery and manufactory of the brain, and has
          thus come under the forms of space, time and causality, by means of
          which it is first presented to us as extended in space and ever
          active in time. From such an indirectly given object, materialism
          seeks to explain what is immediately given, the idea (in which
          alone the object that materialism starts with exists), and finally
          even the will from which all those fundamental forces, that
          manifest themselves, under the guidance of causes, and therefore
          according to law, are in truth to be explained. To the assertion
          that thought is a modification of matter we may always, with equal
          right, oppose the contrary assertion that all <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page036">[pg 036]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg036"></a> matter is merely the modification of
          the knowing subject, as its idea. Yet the aim and ideal of all
          natural science is at bottom a consistent materialism. The
          recognition here of the obvious impossibility of such a system
          establishes another truth which will appear in the course of our
          exposition, the truth that all science properly so called, by which
          I understand systematic knowledge under the guidance of the
          principle of sufficient reason, can never reach its final goal, nor
          give a complete and adequate explanation: for it is not concerned
          with the inmost nature of the world, it cannot get beyond the idea;
          indeed, it really teaches nothing more than the relation of one
          idea to another.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Every science
          must start from two principal data. One of these is always the
          principle of sufficient reason in some form or another, as organon;
          the other is its special object as problem. Thus, for example,
          geometry has space as problem, and the ground of existence in space
          as organon. Arithmetic has time as problem, and the ground of
          existence in time as organon. Logic has the combination of concepts
          as such as problem, and the ground of knowledge as organon. History
          has the past acts of men treated as a whole as problem, and the law
          of human motives as organon. Natural science has matter as problem,
          and the law of causality as organon. Its end and aim is therefore,
          by the guidance of causality, to refer all possible states of
          matter to other states, and ultimately to one single state; and
          again to deduce these states from each other, and ultimately from
          one single state. Thus two states of matter stand over against each
          other in natural science as extremes: that state in which matter is
          furthest from being the immediate object of the subject, and that
          state in which it is most completely such an immediate object,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the most dead and crude
          matter, the primary element, as the one extreme, and the human
          organism as the other. Natural science as chemistry seeks for the
          first, as physiology for the second. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page037">[pg 037]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg037"></a> But as yet neither extreme has been reached,
          and it is only in the intermediate ground that something has been
          won. The prospect is indeed somewhat hopeless. The chemists, under
          the presupposition that the qualitative division of matter is not,
          like quantitative division, an endless process, are always trying
          to decrease the number of the elements, of which there are still
          about sixty; and if they were to succeed in reducing them to two,
          they would still try to find the common root of these. For, on the
          one hand, the law of homogeneity leads to the assumption of a
          primary chemical state of matter, which alone belongs to matter as
          such, and precedes all others which are not essentially matter as
          such, but merely contingent forms and qualities. On the other hand,
          we cannot understand how this one state could ever experience a
          chemical change, if there did not exist a second state to affect
          it. Thus the same difficulty appears in chemistry which Epicurus
          met with in mechanics. For he had to show how the first atom
          departed from the original direction of its motion. Indeed this
          contradiction, which develops entirely of itself and can neither be
          escaped nor solved, might quite properly be set up as a chemical
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">antinomy</span></em>. Thus an antinomy appears
          in the one extreme of natural science, and a corresponding one will
          appear in the other. There is just as little hope of reaching this
          opposite extreme of natural science, for we see ever more clearly
          that what is chemical can never be referred to what is mechanical,
          nor what is organic to what is chemical or electrical. Those who in
          our own day are entering anew on this old, misleading path, will
          soon slink back silent and ashamed, as all their predecessors have
          done before them. We shall consider this more fully in the second
          book. Natural science encounters the difficulties which we have
          cursorily mentioned, in its own province. Regarded as philosophy,
          it would further be materialism; but this, as we have seen, even at
          its birth, has death in its heart, because it ignores <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page038">[pg 038]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg038"></a> the subject and the forms of knowledge,
          which are presupposed, just as much in the case of the crudest
          matter, from which it desires to start, as in that of the organism,
          at which it desires to arrive. For, <span class="tei tei-q">“no
          object without a subject,”</span> is the principle which renders
          all materialism for ever impossible. Suns and planets without an
          eye that sees them, and an understanding that knows them, may
          indeed be spoken of in words, but for the idea, these words are
          absolutely meaningless. On the other hand, the law of causality and
          the treatment and investigation of nature which is based upon it,
          lead us necessarily to the conclusion that, in time, each more
          highly organised state of matter has succeeded a cruder state: so
          that the lower animals existed before men, fishes before land
          animals, plants before fishes, and the unorganised before all that
          is organised; that, consequently, the original mass had to pass
          through a long series of changes before the first eye could be
          opened. And yet, the existence of this whole world remains ever
          dependent upon the first eye that opened, even if it were that of
          an insect. For such an eye is a necessary condition of the
          possibility of knowledge, and the whole world exists only in and
          for knowledge, and without it is not even thinkable. The world is
          entirely idea, and as such demands the knowing subject as the
          supporter of its existence. This long course of time itself, filled
          with innumerable changes, through which matter rose from form to
          form till at last the first percipient creature appeared,—this
          whole time itself is only thinkable in the identity of a
          consciousness whose succession of ideas, whose form of knowing it
          is, and apart from which, it loses all meaning and is nothing at
          all. Thus we see, on the one hand, the existence of the whole world
          necessarily dependent upon the first conscious being, however
          undeveloped it may be; on the other hand, this conscious being just
          as necessarily entirely dependent upon a long chain of causes and
          effects which have preceded it, and in which it itself <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page039">[pg 039]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg039"></a> appears as a small link. These two
          contradictory points of view, to each of which we are led with the
          same necessity, we might again call an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">antinomy</span></em> in our faculty of
          knowledge, and set it up as the counterpart of that which we found
          in the first extreme of natural science. The fourfold antinomy of
          Kant will be shown, in the criticism of his philosophy appended to
          this volume, to be a groundless delusion. But the necessary
          contradiction which at last presents itself to us here, finds its
          solution in the fact that, to use Kant's phraseology, time, space,
          and causality do not belong to the thing-in-itself, but only to its
          phenomena, of which they are the form; which in my language means
          this: The objective world, the world as idea, is not the only side
          of the world, but merely its outward side; and it has an entirely
          different side—the side of its inmost nature—its kernel—the
          thing-in-itself. This we shall consider in the second book, calling
          it after the most immediate of its objective manifestations—will.
          But the world as idea, with which alone we are here concerned, only
          appears with the opening of the first eye. Without this medium of
          knowledge it cannot be, and therefore it was not before it. But
          without that eye, that is to say, outside of knowledge, there was
          also no before, no time. Thus time has no beginning, but all
          beginning is in time. Since, however, it is the most universal form
          of the knowable, in which all phenomena are united together through
          causality, time, with its infinity of past and future, is present
          in the beginning of knowledge. The phenomenon which fills the first
          present must at once be known as causally bound up with and
          dependent upon a sequence of phenomena which stretches infinitely
          into the past, and this past itself is just as truly conditioned by
          this first present, as conversely the present is by the past.
          Accordingly the past out of which the first present arises, is,
          like it, dependent upon the knowing subject, without which it is
          nothing. It necessarily happens, however, that this first
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page040">[pg 040]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg040"></a> present does not
          manifest itself as the first, that is, as having no past for its
          parent, but as being the beginning of time. It manifests itself
          rather as the consequence of the past, according to the principle
          of existence in time. In the same way, the phenomena which fill
          this first present appear as the effects of earlier phenomena which
          filled the past, in accordance with the law of causality. Those who
          like mythological interpretations may take the birth of Kronos
          (χρονος), the youngest of the Titans, as a symbol of the moment
          here referred to at which time appears, though, indeed it has no
          beginning; for with him, since he ate his father, the crude
          productions of heaven and earth cease, and the races of gods and
          men appear upon the scene.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This explanation
          at which we have arrived by following the most consistent of the
          philosophical systems which start from the object, materialism, has
          brought out clearly the inseparable and reciprocal dependence of
          subject and object, and at the same time the inevitable antithesis
          between them. And this knowledge leads us to seek for the inner
          nature of the world, the thing-in-itself, not in either of the two
          elements of the idea, but in something quite distinct from it, and
          which is not encumbered with such a fundamental and insoluble
          antithesis.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Opposed to the
          system we have explained, which starts from the object in order to
          derive the subject from it, is the system which starts from the
          subject and tries to derive the object from it. The first of these
          has been of frequent and common occurrence throughout the history
          of philosophy, but of the second we find only one example, and that
          a very recent one; the <span class="tei tei-q">“philosophy of
          appearance”</span> of J. G. Fichte. In this respect, therefore, it
          must be considered; little real worth or inner meaning as the
          doctrine itself had. It was indeed for the most part merely a
          delusion, but it was delivered with an air of the deepest
          earnestness, with sustained loftiness of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page041">[pg 041]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg041"></a> tone and zealous ardour, and was defended
          with eloquent polemic against weak opponents, so that it was able
          to present a brilliant exterior and seemed to be something. But the
          genuine earnestness which keeps truth always steadfastly before it
          as its goal, and is unaffected by any external influences, was
          entirely wanting to Fichte, as it is to all philosophers who, like
          him, concern themselves with questions of the day. In his case,
          indeed, it could not have been otherwise. A man becomes a
          philosopher by reason of a certain perplexity, from which he seeks
          to free himself. This is Plato's θαυμαξειν, which he calls a μαλα
          φιλοσοφικον παθος. But what distinguishes the false philosopher
          from the true is this: the perplexity of the latter arises from the
          contemplation of the world itself, while that of the former results
          from some book, some system of philosophy which is before him. Now
          Fichte belongs to the class of the false philosophers. He was made
          a philosopher by Kant's doctrine of the thing-in-itself, and if it
          had not been for this he would probably have pursued entirely
          different ends, with far better results, for he certainly possessed
          remarkable rhetorical talent. If he had only penetrated somewhat
          deeply into the meaning of the book that made him a philosopher,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“The Critique of Pure Reason,”</span> he
          would have understood that its principal teaching about mind is
          this. The principle of sufficient reason is not, as all scholastic
          philosophy maintains, a <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">veritas
          aeterna</span></span>—that is to say, it does not possess an
          unconditioned validity before, outside of, and above the world. It
          is relative and conditioned, and valid only in the sphere of
          phenomena, and thus it may appear as the necessary nexus of space
          and time, or as the law of causality, or as the law of the ground
          of knowledge. The inner nature of the world, the thing-in-itself
          can never be found by the guidance of this principle, for all that
          it leads to will be found to be dependent and relative and merely
          phenomenal, not the thing-in-itself. Further, it does not concern
          the subject, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page042">[pg
          042]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg042"></a>
          but is only the form of objects, which are therefore not
          things-in-themselves. The subject must exist along with the object,
          and the object along with the subject, so that it is impossible
          that subject and object can stand to each other in a relation of
          reason and consequent. But Fichte did not take up the smallest
          fragment of all this. All that interested him about the matter was
          that the system started from the subject. Now Kant had chosen this
          procedure in order to show the fallacy of the prevalent systems,
          which started from the object, and through which the object had
          come, to be regarded as a thing-in-itself. Fichte, however, took
          this departure from the subject for the really important matter,
          and like all imitators, he imagined that in going further than Kant
          he was surpassing him. Thus he repeated the fallacy with regard to
          the subject, which all the previous dogmatism had perpetrated with
          regard to the object, and which had been the occasion of Kant's
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Critique”</span>. Fichte then made no
          material change, and the fundamental fallacy, the assumption of a
          relation of reason and consequent between object and subject,
          remained after him as it was before him. The principle of
          sufficient reason possessed as before an unconditioned validity,
          and the only difference was that the thing-in-itself was now placed
          in the subject instead of, as formerly, in the object. The entire
          relativity of both subject and object, which proves that the
          thing-in-itself, or the inner nature of the world, is not to be
          sought in them at all, but outside of them, and outside everything
          else that exists merely relatively, still remained unknown. Just as
          if Kant had never existed, the principle of sufficient reason is to
          Fichte precisely what it was to all the schoolmen, a <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">veritas aeterna</span></span>. As an eternal
          fate reigned over the gods of old, so these <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">aeternæ veritates</span></span>, these
          metaphysical, mathematical and metalogical truths, and in the case
          of some, the validity of the moral law also, reigned over the God
          of the schoolmen. These <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">veritates</span></span> alone were independent
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page043">[pg 043]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg043"></a> of everything, and
          through their necessity both God and the world existed. According
          to the principle of sufficient reason, as such a <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">veritas aeterna</span></span>, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ego</span></em> is
          for Fichte the ground of the world, or of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">non-ego</span></em>, the object, which is just
          its consequent, its creation. He has therefore taken good care to
          avoid examining further or limiting the principle of sufficient
          reason. If, however, it is thought I should specify the form of the
          principle of sufficient reason under the guidance of which Fichte
          derives the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">non-ego</span></em> from the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ego</span></em>, as
          a spider spins its web out of itself, I find that it is the
          principle of sufficient reason of existence in space: for it is
          only as referred to this that some kind of meaning and sense can be
          attached to the laboured deductions of the way in which the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ego</span></em> produces and fabricates the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">non-ego</span></em> from itself, which form
          the content of the most senseless, and consequently the most
          wearisome book that was ever written. This philosophy of Fichte,
          otherwise not worth mentioning, is interesting to us only as the
          tardy expression of the converse of the old materialism. For
          materialism was the most consistent system starting from the
          object, as this is the most consistent system starting from the
          subject. Materialism overlooked the fact that, with the simplest
          object, it assumed the subject also; and Fichte overlooked the fact
          that with the subject (whatever he may call it) he assumed the
          object also, for no subject is thinkable without an object. Besides
          this he forgot that all <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          priori</span></span> deduction, indeed all demonstration in
          general, must rest upon some necessity, and that all necessity is
          based on the principle of sufficient reason, because to be
          necessary, and to follow from given grounds are convertible
          conceptions.<a href="#note_10" id="noteref_10" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">10</span></span></a> But
          the principle of sufficient reason is just the universal form of
          the object as such. Thus it is in the object, but is not valid
          before <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page044">[pg
          044]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg044"></a>
          and outside of it; it first produces the object and makes it appear
          in conformity with its regulative principle. We see then that the
          system which starts from the subject contains the same fallacy as
          the system, explained above, which starts from the object; it
          begins by assuming what it proposes to deduce, the necessary
          correlative of its starting-point.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The method of
          our own system is <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">toto genere</span></span>
          distinct from these two opposite misconceptions, for we start
          neither from the object nor from the subject, but from the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">idea</span></em>, as the first fact of
          consciousness. Its first essential, fundamental form is the
          antithesis of subject and object. The form of the object again is
          the principle of sufficient reason in its various forms. Each of
          these reigns so absolutely in its own class of ideas that, as we
          have seen, when the special form of the principle of sufficient
          reason which governs any class of ideas is known, the nature of the
          whole class is known also: for the whole class, as idea, is no more
          than this form of the principle of sufficient reason itself; so
          that time itself is nothing but the principle of existence in it,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, succession; space is
          nothing but the principle of existence in it, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          position; matter is nothing but causality; the concept (as will
          appear immediately) is nothing but relation to a ground of
          knowledge. This thorough and consistent relativity of the world as
          idea, both according to its universal form (subject and object),
          and according to the form which is subordinate to this (the
          principle of sufficient reason) warns us, as we said before, to
          seek the inner nature of the world in an aspect of it which is
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">quite
          different and quite distinct from the idea</span></em>; and in the
          next book we shall find this in a fact which is just as immediate
          to every living being as the idea.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But we must
          first consider that class of ideas which belongs to man alone. The
          matter of these is the concept, and the subjective correlative is
          reason, just as the subjective correlative of the ideas we have
          already considered <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page045">[pg
          045]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg045"></a>
          was understanding and sensibility, which are also to be attributed
          to all the lower animals.<a href="#note_11" id="noteref_11" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">11</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 8. As from the
          direct light of the sun to the borrowed light of the moon, we pass
          from the immediate idea of perception, which stands by itself and
          is its own warrant, to reflection, to the abstract, discursive
          concepts of the reason, which obtain their whole content from
          knowledge of perception, and in relation to it. As long as we
          continue simply to perceive, all is clear, firm, and certain. There
          are neither questions nor doubts nor errors; we desire to go no
          further, can go no further; we find rest in perceiving, and
          satisfaction in the present. Perception suffices for itself, and
          therefore what springs purely from it, and remains true to it, for
          example, a genuine work of art, can never be false, nor can it be
          discredited through the lapse of time, for it does not present an
          opinion but the thing itself. But with abstract knowledge, with
          reason, doubt and error appear in the theoretical, care and sorrow
          in the practical. In the idea of perception, illusion may at
          moments take the place of the real; but in the sphere of abstract
          thought, error may reign for a thousand years, impose its yoke upon
          whole nations, extend to the noblest impulses of humanity, and, by
          the help of its slaves and its dupes, may chain and fetter those
          whom it cannot deceive. It is the enemy against which the wisest
          men of all times have waged unequal war, and only what they have
          won from it has become the possession of mankind. Therefore it is
          well to draw attention to it at once, as we already tread the
          ground to which its province belongs. It has often been said that
          we ought to follow truth even although no utility can be seen in
          it, because it may have indirect utility which may appear when it
          is least expected; and I would add to this, that we ought to be
          just as anxious to discover and to root out all error even
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page046">[pg 046]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg046"></a> when no harm is
          anticipated from it, because its mischief may be very indirect, and
          may suddenly appear when we do not expect it, for all error has
          poison at its heart. If it is mind, if it is knowledge, that makes
          man the lord of creation, there can be no such thing as harmless
          error, still less venerable and holy error. And for the consolation
          of those who in any way and at any time may have devoted strength
          and life to the noble and hard battle against error, I cannot
          refrain from adding that, so long as truth is absent, error will
          have free play, as owls and bats in the night; but sooner would we
          expect to see the owls and the bats drive back the sun in the
          eastern heavens, than that any truth which has once been known and
          distinctly and fully expressed, can ever again be so utterly
          vanquished and overcome that the old error shall once more reign
          undisturbed over its wide kingdom. This is the power of truth; its
          conquest is slow and laborious, but if once the victory be gained
          it can never be wrested back again.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Besides the
          ideas we have as yet considered, which, according to their
          construction, could be referred to time, space, and matter, if we
          consider them with reference to the object, or to pure sensibility
          and understanding (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, knowledge of causality),
          if we consider them with reference to the subject, another faculty
          of knowledge has appeared in man alone of all earthly creatures, an
          entirely new consciousness, which, with very appropriate and
          significant exactness, is called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">reflection</span></em>. For it is in fact
          derived from the knowledge of perception, and is a reflected
          appearance of it. But it has assumed a nature fundamentally
          different. The forms of perception do not affect it, and even the
          principle of sufficient reason which reigns over all objects has an
          entirely different aspect with regard to it. It is just this new,
          more highly endowed, consciousness, this abstract reflex of all
          that belongs to perception in that conception of the reason which
          has nothing to do with perception, that gives to man that
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page047">[pg 047]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg047"></a> thoughtfulness which
          distinguishes his consciousness so entirely from that of the lower
          animals, and through which his whole behaviour upon earth is so
          different from that of his irrational fellow-creatures. He far
          surpasses them in power and also in suffering. They live in the
          present alone, he lives also in the future and the past. They
          satisfy the needs of the moment, he provides by the most ingenious
          preparations for the future, yea for days that he shall never see.
          They are entirely dependent on the impression of the moment, on the
          effect of the perceptible motive; he is determined by abstract
          conceptions independent of the present. Therefore he follows
          predetermined plans, he acts from maxims, without reference to his
          surroundings or the accidental impression of the moment. Thus, for
          example, he can make with composure deliberate preparations for his
          own death, he can dissemble past finding out, and can carry his
          secret with him to the grave; lastly, he has an actual choice
          between several motives; for only in the abstract can such motives,
          present together in consciousness, afford the knowledge with regard
          to themselves, that the one excludes the other, and can thus
          measure themselves against each other with reference to their power
          over the will. The motive that overcomes, in that it decides the
          question at issue, is the deliberate determinant of the will, and
          is a sure indication of its character. The brute, on the other
          hand, is determined by the present impression; only the fear of
          present compulsion can constrain its desires, until at last this
          fear has become custom, and as such continues to determine it; this
          is called training. The brute feels and perceives; man, in addition
          to this, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thinks</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">knows</span></em>:
          both <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em>. The brute expresses its
          feelings and dispositions by gestures and sounds; man communicates
          his thought to others, or, if he wishes, he conceals it, by means
          of speech. Speech is the first production, and also the necessary
          organ of his reason. Therefore in Greek and Italian, speech and
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page048">[pg 048]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg048"></a> reason are expressed
          by the same word; ὁ λογος, <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="it"><span style="font-style: italic">il
          discorso</span></span>. <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">Vernunft</span></span> is derived from
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">vernehmen</span></span>, which is not a
          synonym for the verb to hear, but signifies the consciousness of
          the meaning of thoughts communicated in words. It is by the help of
          language alone that reason accomplishes its most important
          achievements,—the united action of several individuals, the planned
          co-operation of many thousands, civilisation, the state; also
          science, the storing up of experience, the uniting of common
          properties in one concept, the communication of truth, the spread
          of error, thoughts and poems, dogmas and superstitions. The brute
          first knows death when it dies, but man draws consciously nearer to
          it every hour that he lives; and this makes life at times a
          questionable good even to him who has not recognised this character
          of constant annihilation in the whole of life. Principally on this
          account man has philosophies and religions, though it is uncertain
          whether the qualities we admire most in his conduct, voluntary
          rectitude and nobility of feeling, were ever the fruit of either of
          them. As results which certainly belong only to them, and as
          productions of reason in this sphere, we may refer to the
          marvellous and monstrous opinions of philosophers of various
          schools, and the extraordinary and sometimes cruel customs of the
          priests of different religions.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is the
          universal opinion of all times and of all nations that these
          manifold and far-reaching achievements spring from a common
          principle, from that peculiar intellectual power which belongs
          distinctively to man and which has been called reason, ὁ λογος, το
          λογιστικον, το λογιμον, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">ratio</span></span>. Besides this, no one
          finds any difficulty in recognising the manifestations of this
          faculty, and in saying what is rational and what is irrational,
          where reason appears as distinguished from the other faculties and
          qualities of man, or lastly, in pointing out what, on account of
          the want of reason, we must never expect even from the most
          sensible brute. The philosophers <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page049">[pg 049]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg049"></a> of all ages may be said to be on the whole at
          one about this general knowledge of reason, and they have also
          given prominence to several very important manifestations of it;
          such as, the control of the emotions and passions, the capacity for
          drawing conclusions and formulating general principles, even such
          as are true prior to all experience, and so forth. Still all their
          explanations of the peculiar nature of reason are wavering, not
          clearly defined, discursive, without unity and concentration; now
          laying stress on one manifestation, now on another, and therefore
          often at variance with each other. Besides this, many start from
          the opposition between reason and revelation, a distinction which
          is unknown to philosophy, and which only increases confusion. It is
          very remarkable that up till now no philosopher has referred these
          manifold expressions of reason to one simple function which would
          be recognised in them all, from which they would all be explained,
          and which would therefore constitute the real inner nature of
          reason. It is true that the excellent Locke in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Essay on the Human Understanding”</span> (Book II.,
          ch. xi., §§ 10 and 11), very rightly refers to general concepts as
          the characteristic which distinguishes man from the brutes, and
          Leibnitz quotes this with full approval in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Nouveaux Essais sur l'Entendement Humaine”</span>
          (Book II., ch. xi., §§ 10 and 11.) But when Locke (in Book IV., ch.
          xvii., §§ 2 and 3) comes to the special explanation of reason he
          entirely loses sight of this simple, primary characteristic, and he
          also falls into a wavering, undetermined, incomplete account of
          mangled and derivative manifestations of it. Leibnitz also, in the
          corresponding part of his work, behaves in a similar manner, only
          with more confusion and indistinctness. In the Appendix, I have
          fully considered how Kant confused and falsified the conception of
          the nature of reason. But whoever will take the trouble to go
          through in this reference the mass of philosophical writing which
          has appeared since <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page050">[pg
          050]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg050"></a>
          Kant, will find out, that just as the faults of princes must be
          expiated by whole nations, the errors of great minds extend their
          influence over whole generations, and even over centuries; they
          grow and propagate themselves, and finally degenerate into
          monstrosities. All this arises from the fact that, as Berkeley
          says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Few men think; yet all will have
          opinions.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
          understanding has only one function—immediate knowledge of the
          relation of cause and effect. Yet the perception of the real world,
          and all common sense, sagacity, and inventiveness, however
          multifarious their applications may be, are quite clearly seen to
          be nothing more than manifestations of that one function. So also
          the reason has one function; and from it all the manifestations of
          reason we have mentioned, which distinguish the life of man from
          that of the brutes, may easily be explained. The application or the
          non-application of this function is all that is meant by what men
          have everywhere and always called rational and irrational.<a href="#note_12" id="noteref_12" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">12</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 9. Concepts
          form a distinct class of ideas, existing only in the mind of man,
          and entirely different from the ideas of perception which we have
          considered up till now. We can therefore never attain to a sensuous
          and, properly speaking, evident knowledge of their nature, but only
          to a knowledge which is abstract and discursive. It would,
          therefore, be absurd to demand that they should be verified in
          experience, if by experience is meant the real external world,
          which consists of ideas of perception, or that they should be
          brought before the eyes or the imagination like objects of
          perception. They can only be thought, not perceived, and only the
          effects which men accomplish through them are properly objects of
          experience. Such effects are language, preconceived and planned
          action and science, and all that results from these. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page051">[pg 051]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg051"></a> Speech, as an object of outer
          experience, is obviously nothing more than a very complete
          telegraph, which communicates arbitrary signs with the greatest
          rapidity and the finest distinctions of difference. But what do
          these signs mean? How are they interpreted? When some one speaks,
          do we at once translate his words into pictures of the fancy, which
          instantaneously flash upon us, arrange and link themselves
          together, and assume form and colour according to the words that
          are poured forth, and their grammatical inflections? What a tumult
          there would be in our brains while we listened to a speech, or to
          the reading of a book? But what actually happens is not this at
          all. The meaning of a speech is, as a rule, immediately grasped,
          accurately and distinctly taken in, without the imagination being
          brought into play. It is reason which speaks to reason, keeping
          within its own province. It communicates and receives abstract
          conceptions, ideas that cannot be presented in perceptions, which
          are framed once for all, and are relatively few in number, but
          which yet encompass, contain, and represent all the innumerable
          objects of the actual world. This itself is sufficient to prove
          that the lower animals can never learn to speak or comprehend,
          although they have the organs of speech and ideas of perception in
          common with us. But because words represent this perfectly distinct
          class of ideas, whose subjective correlative is reason, they are
          without sense and meaning for the brutes. Thus language, like every
          other manifestation which we ascribe to reason, and like everything
          which distinguishes man from the brutes, is to be explained from
          this as its one simple source—conceptions, abstract ideas which
          cannot be presented in perception, but are general, and have no
          individual existence in space and time. Only in single cases do we
          pass from the conception to the perception, do we construct images
          as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">representatives of concepts</span></em> in
          perception, to which, however, they are never adequate. These cases
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page052">[pg 052]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg052"></a> are fully discussed
          in the essay on the principle of sufficient reason, § 28, and
          therefore I shall not repeat my explanation here. It may be
          compared, however, with what is said by Hume in the twelfth of his
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Philosophical Essays,”</span> p. 244, and
          by Herder in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Metacritik,”</span> pt.
          i. p. 274 (an otherwise worthless book). The Platonic idea, the
          possibility of which depends upon the union of imagination and
          reason, is the principal subject of the third book of this
          work.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Although
          concepts are fundamentally different from ideas of perception, they
          stand in a necessary relation to them, without which they would be
          nothing. This relation therefore constitutes the whole nature and
          existence of concepts. Reflection is the necessary copy or
          repetition of the originally presented world of perception, but it
          is a special kind of copy in an entirely different material. Thus
          concepts may quite properly be called ideas of ideas. The principle
          of sufficient reason has here also a special form. Now we have seen
          that the form under which the principle of sufficient reason
          appears in a class of ideas always constitutes and exhausts the
          whole nature of the class, so far as it consists of ideas, so that
          time is throughout succession, and nothing more; space is
          throughout position, and nothing more; matter is throughout
          causation, and nothing more. In the same way the whole nature of
          concepts, or the class of abstract ideas, consists simply in the
          relation which the principle of sufficient reason expresses in
          them; and as this is the relation to the ground of knowledge, the
          whole nature of the abstract idea is simply and solely its relation
          to another idea, which is its ground of knowledge. This, indeed,
          may, in the first instance, be a concept, an abstract idea, and
          this again may have only a similar abstract ground of knowledge;
          but the chain of grounds of knowledge does not extend <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ad infinitum</span></span>; it must end at
          last in a concept which has its ground in knowledge of perception;
          for the whole world of reflection <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page053">[pg 053]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg053"></a> rests on the world of perception as its
          ground of knowledge. Hence the class of abstract ideas is in this
          respect distinguished from other classes; in the latter the
          principle of sufficient reason always demands merely a relation to
          another idea of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">same</span></em> class, but in the case of
          abstract ideas, it at last demands a relation to an idea of
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">another</span></em> class.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Those concepts
          which, as has just been pointed out, are not immediately related to
          the world of perception, but only through the medium of one, or it
          may be several other concepts, have been called by preference
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">abstracta</span></span>, and those which have
          their ground immediately in the world of perception have been
          called <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">concreta</span></span>. But
          this last name is only loosely applicable to the concepts denoted
          by it, for they are always merely <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">abstracta</span></span>, and not ideas of
          perception. These names, which have originated in a very dim
          consciousness of the distinctions they imply, may yet, with this
          explanation, be retained. As examples of the first kind of
          concepts, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">abstracta</span></span> in the fullest sense,
          we may take <span class="tei tei-q">“relation,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“virtue,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“investigation,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“beginning,”</span> and so on. As examples of the
          second kind, loosely called <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">concreta</span></span>, we may take such
          concepts as <span class="tei tei-q">“man,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“stone,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“horse,”</span>
          &amp;c. If it were not a somewhat too pictorial and therefore
          absurd simile, we might very appropriately call the latter the
          ground floor, and the former the upper stories of the building of
          reflection.<a href="#note_13" id="noteref_13" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">13</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is not, as is
          commonly supposed, an essential characteristic of a concept that it
          should contain much under it, that is to say, that many ideas of
          perception, or it may be other abstract ideas, should stand to it
          in the relation of its ground of knowledge, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          be thought through it. This is merely a derived and secondary
          characteristic, and, as a matter of fact, does not always exist,
          though it must always exist potentially. This characteristic arises
          from the fact that a concept is an <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page054">[pg 054]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg054"></a> idea of an idea, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          its whole nature consists in its relation to another idea; but as
          it is not this idea itself, which is generally an idea of
          perception and therefore belongs to quite a different class, the
          latter may have temporal, spacial, and other determinations, and in
          general many relations which are not thought along with it in the
          concept. Thus we see that several ideas which are different in
          unessential particulars may be thought by means of one concept,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, may be brought under it.
          Yet this power of embracing several things is not an essential but
          merely an accidental characteristic of the concept. There may be
          concepts through which only one real object is thought, but which
          are nevertheless abstract and general, by no means capable of
          presentation individually and as perceptions. Such, for example, is
          the conception which any one may have of a particular town which he
          only knows from geography; although only this one town is thought
          under it, it might yet be applied to several towns differing in
          certain respects. We see then that a concept is not general because
          of being abstracted from several objects; but conversely, because
          generality, that is to say, non-determination of the particular,
          belongs to the concept as an abstract idea of the reason, different
          things can be thought by means of the same one.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It follows from
          what has been said that every concept, just because it is abstract
          and incapable of presentation in perception, and is therefore not a
          completely determined idea, has what is called extension or sphere,
          even in the case in which only one real object exists that
          corresponds to it. Now we always find that the sphere of one
          concept has something in common with the sphere of other concepts.
          That is to say, part of what is thought under one concept is the
          same as what is thought under other concepts; and conversely, part
          of what is thought under these concepts is the same as what is
          thought under the first; although, if they are <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page055">[pg 055]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg055"></a> really different concepts, each of
          them, or at least one of them, contains something which the other
          does not contain; this is the relation in which every subject
          stands to its predicate. The recognition of this relation is called
          judgment. The representation of these spheres by means of figures
          in space, is an exceedingly happy idea. It first occurred to
          Gottfried Plouquet, who used squares for the purpose. Lambert,
          although later than him, used only lines, which he placed under
          each other. Euler carried out the idea completely with circles.
          Upon what this complete analogy between the relations of concepts,
          and those of figures in space, ultimately rests, I am unable to
          say. It is, however, a very fortunate circumstance for logic that
          all the relations of concepts, according to their possibility,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          priori</span></span>, may be made plain in perception by the use of
          such figures, in the following way:—</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(1.) The spheres
          of two concepts coincide: for example the concept of necessity and
          the concept of following from given grounds, in the same way the
          concepts of <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Ruminantia</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Bisulca</span></span> (ruminating and
          cloven-hoofed animals), also those of vertebrate and red-blooded
          animals (although there might be some doubt about this on account
          of the annelida): they are convertible concepts. Such concepts are
          represented by a single circle which stands for either of them.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(2.) The sphere
          of one concept includes that of the other.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1.00em"></p>
<div class="tei tei-figure" style="width: 50%; text-align: center">
<img alt='Illustration: Category "horse" within category "animal".' src="images/illus_091.png" id="img_images_illus_091.png"></div><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page056">[pg 056]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg056"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(3.) A sphere
          includes two or more spheres which exclude each other and fill
          it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1.00em"></p>
<div class="tei tei-figure" style="width: 50%; text-align: center">
<img alt='Illustration: Circle divided into thirds "right", "acute", and "obtuse".' src="images/illus_092_a.png" id="img_images_illus_092_a.png"></div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(4.) Two spheres
          include each a part of the other.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1.00em"></p>
<div class="tei tei-figure" style="width: 50%; text-align: center">

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(5.) Two spheres
          lie in a third, but do not fill it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1.00em"></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This last case
          applies to all concepts whose spheres have nothing immediately in
          common, for there is always a third sphere, often a much wider one,
          which includes both.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To these cases
          all combinations of concepts may be referred, and from them the
          entire doctrine of the judgment, its conversion, contraposition,
          equipollence, disjunction (this according to the third figure) may
          be deduced. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page057">[pg
          057]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg057"></a>
          From these also may be derived the properties of the judgment, upon
          which Kant based his pretended categories of the understanding,
          with the exception however of the hypothetical form, which is not a
          combination of concepts, but of judgments. A full account is given
          in the Appendix of <span class="tei tei-q">“Modality,”</span> and
          indeed of every property of judgments on which the categories are
          founded.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With regard to
          the possible combinations of concepts which we have given, it has
          only further to be remarked that they may also be combined with
          each other in many ways. For example, the fourth figure with the
          second. Only if one sphere, which partly or wholly contains
          another, is itself contained in a third sphere, do these together
          exemplify the syllogism in the first figure, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          that combination of judgments, by means of which it is known that a
          concept which is partly or wholly contained in another concept, is
          also contained in a third concept, which again contains the first:
          and also, conversely, the negation; the pictorial representation of
          which can, of course, only be two connected spheres which do not
          lie within a third sphere. If many spheres are brought together in
          this way we get a long train of syllogisms. This schematism of
          concepts, which has already been fairly well explained in more than
          one textbook, may be used as the foundation of the doctrine of the
          judgment, and indeed of the whole syllogistic theory, and in this
          way the treatment of both becomes very easy and simple. Because,
          through it, all syllogistic rules may be seen in their origin, and
          may be deduced and explained. It is not necessary, however, to load
          the memory with these rules, as logic is never of practical use,
          but has only a theoretical interest for philosophy. For although it
          may be said that logic is related to rational thinking as
          thorough-bass is to music, or less exactly, as ethics is to virtue,
          or æsthetics to art; we must yet remember that no one ever became
          an artist by the study of æsthetics; that a noble character was
          never <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page058">[pg 058]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg058"></a> formed by the study
          of ethics; that long before Rameau, men composed correctly and
          beautifully, and that we do not need to know thorough-bass in order
          to detect discords: and just as little do we need to know logic in
          order to avoid being misled by fallacies. Yet it must be conceded
          that thorough-bass is of the greatest use in the practice of
          musical composition, although it may not be necessary for the
          understanding of it; and indeed æsthetics and even ethics, though
          in a much less degree, and for the most part negatively, may be of
          some use in practice, so that we cannot deny them all practical
          worth, but of logic even this much cannot be conceded. It is
          nothing more than the knowledge in the abstract of what every one
          knows in the concrete. Therefore we call in the aid of logical
          rules, just as little to enable us to construct a correct argument
          as to prevent us from consenting to a false one, and the most
          learned logician lays aside the rules of logic altogether in his
          actual thought. This may be explained in the following way. Every
          science is a system of general and therefore abstract truths, laws,
          and rules with reference to a special class of objects. The
          individual case coming under these laws is determined in accordance
          with this general knowledge, which is valid once for all; because
          such application of the general principle is far easier than the
          exhaustive investigation of the particular case; for the general
          abstract knowledge which has once been obtained is always more
          within our reach than the empirical investigation of the particular
          case. With logic, however, it is just the other way. It is the
          general knowledge of the mode of procedure of the reason expressed
          in the form of rules. It is reached by the introspection of reason,
          and by abstraction from all content. But this mode of procedure is
          necessary and essential to reason, so that it will never depart
          from it if left to itself. It is, therefore, easier and surer to
          let it proceed itself according to its nature in each particular
          case, than to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page059">[pg
          059]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg059"></a>
          present to it the knowledge abstracted from this procedure in the
          form of a foreign and externally given law. It is easier, because,
          while in the case of all other sciences, the general rule is more
          within our reach than the investigation of the particular case
          taken by itself; with the use of reason, on the contrary, its
          necessary procedure in a given case is always more within our reach
          than the general rule abstracted from it; for that which thinks in
          us is reason itself. It is surer, because a mistake may more easily
          occur in such abstract knowledge, or in its application, than that
          a process of reason should take place which would run contrary to
          its essence and nature. Hence arises the remarkable fact, that
          while in other sciences the particular case is always proved by the
          rule, in logic, on the contrary, the rule must always be proved
          from the particular case; and even the most practised logician, if
          he remark that in some particular case he concludes otherwise than
          the rule prescribes, will always expect to find a mistake in the
          rule rather than in his own conclusion. To desire to make practical
          use of logic means, therefore, to desire to derive with unspeakable
          trouble, from general rules, that which is immediately known with
          the greatest certainty in the particular case. It is just as if a
          man were to consult mechanics as to the motion of his body, and
          physiology as to his digestion; and whoever has learnt logic for
          practical purposes is like him who would teach a beaver to make its
          own dam. Logic is, therefore, without practical utility; but it
          must nevertheless be retained, because it has philosophical
          interest as the special knowledge of the organisation and action of
          reason. It is rightly regarded as a definite, self-subsisting,
          self-contained, complete, and thoroughly safe discipline; to be
          treated scientifically for itself alone and independently of
          everything else, and therefore to be studied at the universities.
          But it has its real value, in relation to philosophy as a whole, in
          the inquiry into the nature of knowledge, and indeed of
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page060">[pg 060]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg060"></a> rational and
          abstract knowledge. Therefore the exposition of logic should not
          have so much the form of a practical science, should not contain
          merely naked arbitrary rules for the correct formation of the
          judgment, the syllogism, &amp;c., but should rather be directed to
          the knowledge of the nature of reason and the concept, and to the
          detailed investigation of the principle of sufficient reason of
          knowing. For logic is only a paraphrase of this principle, and,
          more exactly, only of that exemplification of it in which the
          ground that gives truth to the judgment is neither empirical nor
          metaphysical, but logical or metalogical. Besides the principle of
          sufficient reason of knowing, it is necessary to take account of
          the three remaining fundamental laws of thought, or judgments of
          metalogical truth, so nearly related to it; and out of these the
          whole science of reason grows. The nature of thought proper, that
          is to say, of the judgment and the syllogism, must be exhibited in
          the combination of the spheres of concepts, according to the
          analogy of the special schema, in the way shown above; and from all
          this the rules of the judgment and the syllogism are to be deduced
          by construction. The only practical use we can make of logic is in
          a debate, when we can convict our antagonist of his intentional
          fallacies, rather than of his actual mistakes, by giving them their
          technical names. By thus throwing into the background the practical
          aim of logic, and bringing out its connection with the whole scheme
          of philosophy as one of its chapters, we do not think that we shall
          make the study of it less prevalent than it is just now. For at the
          present day every one who does not wish to remain uncultured, and
          to be numbered with the ignorant and incompetent multitude, must
          study speculative philosophy. For the nineteenth century is a
          philosophical age, though by this we do not mean either that it has
          philosophy, or that philosophy governs it, but rather that it is
          ripe for philosophy, and, therefore, stands in need of it. This is
          a sign of a high <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page061">[pg
          061]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg061"></a>
          degree of civilisation, and indeed, is a definite stage in the
          culture of the ages.<a href="#note_14" id="noteref_14" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">14</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Though logic is
          of so little practical use, it cannot be denied that it was
          invented for practical purposes. It appears to me to have
          originated in the following way:—As the love of debating developed
          among the Eleatics, the Megarics, and the Sophists, and by degrees
          became almost a passion, the confusion in which nearly every debate
          ended must have made them feel the necessity of a method of
          procedure as a guide; and for this a scientific dialectic had to be
          sought. The first thing which would have to be observed would be
          that both the disputing parties should always be agreed on some one
          proposition, to which the disputed points might be referred. The
          beginning of the methodical procedure consisted in this, that the
          propositions admitted on both sides were formally stated to be so,
          and placed at the head of the inquiry. But these propositions were
          at first concerned only with the material of the inquiry. It was
          soon observed that in the process of going back to the truth
          admitted on both sides, and of deducing their assertions from it,
          each party followed certain forms and laws about which, without any
          express agreement, there was no difference of opinion. And from
          this it became evident that these must constitute the peculiar and
          natural procedure of reason itself, the form of investigation.
          Although this was not exposed to any doubt or difference of
          opinion, some pedantically systematic philosopher hit upon the idea
          that it would look well, and be the completion of the method of
          dialectic, if this formal part of all discussion, this regular
          procedure of reason itself, were to be expressed in abstract
          propositions, just like the substantial propositions admitted on
          both sides, and placed at the beginning of every investigation, as
          the fixed canon of debate to which reference and appeal must always
          be made. In this <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page062">[pg
          062]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg062"></a>
          way what had formerly been followed only by tacit agreement, and
          instinctively, would be consciously recognised and formally
          expressed. By degrees, more or less perfect expressions were found
          for the fundamental principles of logic, such as the principles of
          contradiction, sufficient reason, excluded middle, the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">dictum de omni et nullo</span></span>, as well
          as the special rules of the syllogism, as for example, <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ex meris particularibus aut negativis nihil
          sequitur, a rationato ad rationem non valet
          consequentia</span></span>, and so on. That all this was only
          brought about slowly, and with great pains, and up till the time of
          Aristotle remained very incomplete, is evident from the awkward and
          tedious way in which logical truths are brought out in many of the
          Platonic dialogues, and still more from what Sextus Empiricus tells
          us of the controversies of the Megarics, about the easiest and
          simplest logical rules, and the laborious way in which they were
          brought into a definite form (Sext. Emp. adv. Math. l. 8, p. 112).
          But Aristotle collected, arranged, and corrected all that had been
          discovered before his time, and brought it to an incomparably
          greater state of perfection. If we thus observe how the course of
          Greek culture had prepared the way for, and led up to the work of
          Aristotle, we shall be little inclined to believe the assertion of
          the Persian author, quoted by Sir William Jones with much approval,
          that Kallisthenes found a complete system of logic among the
          Indians, and sent it to his uncle Aristotle (Asiatic Researches,
          vol. iv. p. 163). It is easy to understand that in the dreary
          middle ages the Aristotelian logic would be very acceptable to the
          controversial spirit of the schoolmen, which, in the absence of all
          real knowledge, spent its energy upon mere formulas and words, and
          that it would be eagerly adopted even in its mutilated Arabian
          form, and presently established as the centre of all knowledge.
          Though its authority has since declined, yet up to our own time
          logic has retained the credit of a self-contained, practical, and
          highly important <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page063">[pg
          063]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg063"></a>
          science. Indeed, in our own day, the Kantian philosophy, the
          foundation-stone of which is taken from logic, has excited a new
          interest in it; which, in this respect, at any rate, that is, as
          the means of the knowledge of the nature of reason, it
          deserves.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Correct and
          accurate conclusions may be arrived at if we carefully observe the
          relation of the spheres of concepts, and only conclude that one
          sphere is contained in a third sphere, when we have clearly seen
          that this first sphere is contained in a second, which in its turn
          is contained in the third. On the other hand, the art of sophistry
          lies in casting only a superficial glance at the relations of the
          spheres of the concepts, and then manipulating these relations to
          suit our purposes, generally in the following way:—When the sphere
          of an observed concept lies partly within that of another concept,
          and partly within a third altogether different sphere, we treat it
          as if it lay entirely within the one or the other, as may suit our
          purpose. For example, in speaking of passion, we may subsume it
          under the concept of the greatest force, the mightiest agency in
          the world, or under the concept of the irrational, and this again
          under the concept of impotency or weakness. We may then repeat the
          process, and start anew with each concept to which the argument
          leads us. A concept has almost always several others, which
          partially come under it, and each of these contains part of the
          sphere of the first, but also includes in its own sphere something
          more, which is not in the first. But we draw attention only to that
          one of these latter concepts, under which we wish to subsume the
          first, and let the others remain unobserved, or keep them
          concealed. On the possession of this skill depends the whole art of
          sophistry and all finer fallacies; for logical fallacies such as
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">mentiens</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">velatus</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">cornatus</span></span>, &amp;c., are clearly
          too clumsy for actual use. I am not aware that hitherto any one has
          traced the nature of all sophistry and persuasion back to this last
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page064">[pg 064]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg064"></a> possible ground of
          its existence, and referred it to the peculiar character of
          concepts, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, to the procedure of reason
          itself. Therefore, as my exposition has led me to it, though it is
          very easily understood, I will illustrate it in the following table
          by means of a schema. This table is intended to show how the
          spheres of concepts overlap each other at many points, and so leave
          room for a passage from each concept to whichever one we please of
          several other concepts. I hope, however, that no one will be led by
          this table to attach more importance to this little explanation,
          which I have merely given in passing, than ought to belong to it,
          from the nature of the subject. I have chosen as an illustration
          the concept of travelling. Its sphere partially includes four
          others, to any of which the sophist may pass at will; these again
          partly include other spheres, several of them two or more at once,
          and through these the sophist takes whichever way he chooses,
          always as if it were the only way, till at last he reaches, in good
          or evil, whatever end he may have in view. In passing from one
          sphere to another, it is only necessary always to follow the
          direction from the centre (the given chief concept) to the
          circumference, and never to reverse this process. Such a piece of
          sophistry may be either an unbroken speech, or it may assume the
          strict syllogistic form, according to what is the weak side of the
          hearer. Most scientific arguments, and especially philosophical
          demonstrations, are at bottom not much more than this, for how else
          would it be possible, that so much, in different ages, has not only
          been falsely apprehended (for error itself has a different source),
          but demonstrated and proved, and has yet afterwards been found to
          be fundamentally wrong, for example, the Leibnitz-Wolfian
          Philosophy, Ptolemaic Astronomy, Stahl's Chemistry, Newton's Theory
          of Colours, &amp;c. &amp;c.<a href="#note_15" id="noteref_15" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">15</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 10. Through
          all this, the question presses ever more upon us, how <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">certainty</span></em> is to be attained, how
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">judgments</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page065">[pg 065]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg065"></a><span style="font-style: italic">are to be

          knowledge</span></em>, (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">wissen</span></span>), and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">science</span></em>, which we rank with
          language and deliberate action as the third great benefit conferred
          by reason.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Reason is
          feminine in nature; it can only give after it has received. Of
          itself it has nothing but the empty forms of its operation. There
          is no absolutely pure rational knowledge except the four principles
          to which I have attributed metalogical truth; the principles of
          identity, contradiction, excluded middle, and sufficient reason of
          knowledge. For even the rest of logic is not absolutely pure
          rational knowledge. It presupposes the relations and the
          combinations of the spheres of concepts. But concepts in general
          only exist after experience of ideas of perception, and as their
          whole nature consists in their relation to these, it is clear that
          they presuppose them. No special content, however, is presupposed,
          but merely the existence of a content generally, and so logic as a
          whole may fairly pass for pure rational science. In all other
          sciences reason has received its content from ideas of perception;
          in mathematics from the relations of space and time, presented in
          intuition or perception prior to all experience; in pure natural
          science, that is, in what we know of the course of nature prior to
          any experience, the content of the science proceeds from the pure
          understanding, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, from the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span> knowledge of the law of
          causality and its connection with those pure intuitions or
          perceptions of space and time. In all other sciences everything
          that is not derived from the sources we have just referred to
          belongs to experience. Speaking generally, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to know
          rationally</span></em> (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">wissen</span></span>) means to have in the
          power of the mind, and capable of being reproduced at will, such
          judgments as have their sufficient ground of knowledge in something
          outside themselves, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, are true. Thus only
          abstract cognition is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">rational knowledge</span></em> (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">wissen</span></span>), which is therefore the
          result of reason, so that we cannot accurately say of the lower
          animals that they <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">rationally</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page066">[pg 066]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg066"></a><span style="font-style: italic">know</span></em> (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">wissen</span></span>) anything, although they
          have apprehension of what is presented in perception, and memory of
          this, and consequently imagination, which is further proved by the
          circumstance that they dream. We attribute consciousness to them,
          and therefore although the word (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">bewusstsein</span></span>) is derived from the
          verb to know rationally (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">wissen</span></span>), the conception of
          consciousness corresponds generally with that of idea of whatever
          kind it may be. Thus we attribute life to plants, but not
          consciousness. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Rational knowledge</span></em> (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">wissen</span></span>) is therefore abstract
          consciousness, the permanent possession in concepts of the reason,
          of what has become known in another way.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 11. In this
          regard the direct opposite of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">rational knowledge</span></em> is feeling, and
          therefore we must insert the explanation of feeling here. The
          concept which the word feeling denotes has merely a negative
          content, which is this, that something which is present in
          consciousness, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is not a concept</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is not abstract
          rational knowledge</span></em>. Except this, whatever it may be, it
          comes under the concept of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">feeling</span></em>. Thus the immeasurably
          wide sphere of the concept of feeling includes the most different
          kinds of objects, and no one can ever understand how they come
          together until he has recognised that they all agree in this
          negative respect, that they are not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">abstract
          concepts</span></em>. For the most diverse and even antagonistic
          elements lie quietly side by side in this concept; for example,
          religious feeling, feeling of sensual pleasure, moral feeling,
          bodily feeling, as touch, pain, sense of colour, of sounds and
          their harmonies and discords, feeling of hate, of disgust, of
          self-satisfaction, of honour, of disgrace, of right, of wrong,
          sense of truth, æsthetic feeling, feeling of power, weakness,
          health, friendship, love, &amp;c. &amp;c. There is absolutely
          nothing in common among them except the negative quality that they
          are not abstract rational knowledge. But this diversity becomes
          more striking when the apprehension of space relations presented
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span> in perception, and also
          the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page067">[pg 067]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg067"></a> knowledge of the
          pure understanding is brought under this concept, and when we say
          of all knowledge and all truth, of which we are first conscious
          only intuitively, and have not yet formulated in abstract concepts,
          we <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">feel</span></em> it. I should like, for the
          sake of illustration, to give some examples of this taken from
          recent books, as they are striking proofs of my theory. I remember
          reading in the introduction to a German translation of Euclid, that
          we ought to make beginners in geometry draw the figures before
          proceeding to demonstrate, for in this way they would already feel
          geometrical truth before the demonstration brought them complete
          knowledge. In the same way Schleiermacher speaks in his
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Critique of Ethics”</span> of logical and
          mathematical feeling (p. 339), and also of the feeling of the
          sameness or difference of two formulas (p. 342). Again Tennemann in
          his <span class="tei tei-q">“History of Philosophy”</span> (vol.
          I., p. 361) says, <span class="tei tei-q">“One <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">felt</span></em>
          that the fallacies were not right, but could not point out the
          mistakes.”</span> Now, so long as we do not regard this concept
          <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">feeling</span></em>”</span> from the right
          point of view, and do not recognise that one negative
          characteristic which alone is essential to it, it must constantly
          give occasion for misunderstanding and controversy, on account of
          the excessive wideness of its sphere, and its entirely negative and
          very limited content which is determined in a purely one-sided
          manner. Since then we have in German the nearly synonymous word
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">empfindung</span></span> (sensation), it would
          be convenient to make use of it for bodily feeling, as a
          sub-species. This concept <span class="tei tei-q">“feeling,”</span>
          which is quite out of proportion to all others, doubtless
          originated in the following manner. All concepts, and concepts
          alone, are denoted by words; they exist only for the reason, and
          proceed from it. With concepts, therefore, we are already at a
          one-sided point of view; but from such a point of view what is near
          appears distinct and is set down as positive, what is farther off
          becomes mixed up and is soon regarded as merely <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page068">[pg 068]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg068"></a> negative. Thus each nation calls all
          others foreign: to the Greek all others are barbarians; to the
          Englishman all that is not England or English is continent or
          continental; to the believer all others are heretics, or heathens;
          to the noble all others are <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">roturiers</span></span>; to the student all
          others are Philistines, and so forth. Now, reason itself, strange
          as it may seem, is guilty of the same one-sidedness, indeed one
          might say of the same crude ignorance arising from vanity, for it
          classes under the one concept, <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">feeling</span></em>,”</span> every
          modification of consciousness which does not immediately belong to
          its own mode of apprehension, that is to say, which is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not an abstract
          concept</span></em>. It has had to pay the penalty of this hitherto
          in misunderstanding and confusion in its own province, because its
          own procedure had not become clear to it through thorough
          self-knowledge, for a special faculty of feeling has been set up,
          and new theories of it are constructed.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 12. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Rational
          knowledge</span></em> (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">wissen</span></span>) is then all abstract
          knowledge,—that is, the knowledge which is peculiar to the reason
          as distinguished from the understanding. Its contradictory opposite
          has just been explained to be the concept <span class="tei tei-q">“feeling.”</span> Now, as reason only reproduces, for
          knowledge, what has been received in another way, it does not
          actually extend our knowledge, but only gives it another form. It
          enables us to know in the abstract and generally, what first became
          known in sense-perception, in the concrete. But this is much more
          important than it appears at first sight when so expressed. For it
          depends entirely upon the fact that knowledge has become rational
          or abstract knowledge (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">wissen</span></span>), that it can be safely
          preserved, that it is communicable and susceptible of certain and
          wide-reaching application to practice. Knowledge in the form of
          sense-perception is valid only of the particular case, extends only
          to what is nearest, and ends with it, for sensibility and
          understanding can only comprehend one object at a time. Every
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page069">[pg 069]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg069"></a> enduring, arranged,
          and planned activity must therefore proceed from principles,—that
          is, from abstract knowledge, and it must be conducted in accordance
          with them. Thus, for example, the knowledge of the relation of
          cause and effect arrived at by the understanding, is in itself far
          completer, deeper and more exhaustive than anything that can be
          thought about it in the abstract; the understanding alone knows in
          perception directly and completely the nature of the effect of a
          lever, of a pulley, or a cog-wheel, the stability of an arch, and
          so forth. But on account of the peculiarity of the knowledge of
          perception just referred to, that it only extends to what is
          immediately present, the mere understanding can never enable us to
          construct machines and buildings. Here reason must come in; it must
          substitute abstract concepts for ideas of perception, and take them
          as the guide of action; and if they are right, the anticipated
          result will happen. In the same way we have perfect knowledge in
          pure perception of the nature and constitution of the parabola,
          hyperbola, and spiral; but if we are to make trustworthy
          application of this knowledge to the real, it must first become
          abstract knowledge, and by this it certainly loses its character of
          intuition or perception, but on the other hand it gains the
          certainty and preciseness of abstract knowledge. The differential
          calculus does not really extend our knowledge of the curve, it
          contains nothing that was not already in the mere pure perception
          of the curve; but it alters the kind of knowledge, it changes the
          intuitive into an abstract knowledge, which is so valuable for
          application. But here we must refer to another peculiarity of our
          faculty of knowledge, which could not be observed until the
          distinction between the knowledge of the senses and understanding
          and abstract knowledge had been made quite clear. It is this, that
          relations of space cannot as such be directly translated into
          abstract knowledge, but only temporal quantities,—that is, numbers,
          are suitable for this. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page070">[pg
          070]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg070"></a>
          Numbers alone can be expressed in abstract concepts which
          accurately correspond to them, not spacial quantities. The concept
          <span class="tei tei-q">“thousand”</span> is just as different from
          the concept <span class="tei tei-q">“ten,”</span> as both these
          temporal quantities are in perception. We think of a thousand as a
          distinct multiple of ten, into which we can resolve it at pleasure
          for perception in time,—that is to say, we can count it. But
          between the abstract concept of a mile and that of a foot, apart
          from any concrete perception of either, and without the help of
          number, there is no accurate distinction corresponding to the
          quantities themselves. In both we only think of a spacial quantity
          in general, and if they must be completely distinguished we are
          compelled either to call in the assistance of intuition or
          perception in space, which would be a departure from abstract
          knowledge, or we must think the difference in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">numbers</span></em>. If then we wish to have
          abstract knowledge of space-relations we must first translate them
          into time-relations,—that is, into numbers; therefore only
          arithmetic, and not geometry, is the universal science of quantity,
          and geometry must be translated into arithmetic if it is to be
          communicable, accurately precise and applicable in practice. It is
          true that a space-relation as such may also be thought in the
          abstract; for example, <span class="tei tei-q">“the sine increases
          as the angle,”</span> but if the quantity of this relation is to be
          given, it requires number for its expression. This necessity, that
          if we wish to have abstract knowledge of space-relations
          (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, rational knowledge, not
          mere intuition or perception), space with its three dimensions must
          be translated into time which has only one dimension, this
          necessity it is, which makes mathematics so difficult. This becomes
          very clear if we compare the perception of curves with their
          analytical calculation, or the table of logarithms of the
          trigonometrical functions with the perception of the changing
          relations of the parts of a triangle, which are expressed by them.
          What vast mazes of figures, what laborious calculations
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page071">[pg 071]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg071"></a> it would require to
          express in the abstract what perception here apprehends at a glance
          completely and with perfect accuracy, namely, how the co-sine
          diminishes as the sine increases, how the co-sine of one angle is
          the sine of another, the inverse relation of the increase and
          decrease of the two angles, and so forth. How time, we might say,
          must complain, that with its one dimension it should be compelled
          to express the three dimensions of space! Yet this is necessary if
          we wish to possess, for application, an expression, in abstract
          concepts, of space-relations. They could not be translated directly
          into abstract concepts, but only through the medium of the pure
          temporal quantity, number, which alone is directly related to
          abstract knowledge. Yet it is worthy of remark, that as space
          adapts itself so well to perception, and by means of its three
          dimensions, even its complicated relations are easily apprehended,
          while it eludes the grasp of abstract knowledge; time, on the
          contrary, passes easily into abstract knowledge, but gives very
          little to perception. Our perceptions of numbers in their proper
          element, mere time, without the help of space, scarcely extends as
          far as ten, and beyond that we have only abstract concepts of
          numbers, no knowledge of them which can be presented in perception.
          On the other hand, we connect with every numeral, and with all
          algebraical symbols, accurately defined abstract concepts.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We may further
          remark here that some minds only find full satisfaction in what is
          known through perception. What they seek is the reason and
          consequent of being in space, sensuously expressed; a demonstration
          after the manner of Euclid, or an arithmetical solution of spacial
          problems, does not please them. Other minds, on the contrary, seek
          merely the abstract concepts which are needful for applying and
          communicating knowledge. They have patience and memory for abstract
          principles, formulas, demonstrations in long trains of reasoning,
          and calculations, in which the symbols represent the most
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page072">[pg 072]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg072"></a> complicated
          abstractions. The latter seek preciseness, the former sensible
          perception. The difference is characteristic.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The greatest
          value of rational or abstract knowledge is that it can be
          communicated and permanently retained. It is principally on this
          account that it is so inestimably important for practice. Any one
          may have a direct perceptive knowledge through the understanding
          alone, of the causal connection, of the changes and motions of
          natural bodies, and he may find entire satisfaction in it; but he
          cannot communicate this knowledge to others until it has been made
          permanent for thought in concepts. Knowledge of the first kind is
          even sufficient for practice, if a man puts his knowledge into
          practice himself, in an action which can be accomplished while the
          perception is still vivid; but it is not sufficient if the help of
          others is required, or even if the action is his own but must be
          carried out at different times, and therefore requires a
          pre-conceived plan. Thus, for example, a practised billiard-player
          may have a perfect knowledge of the laws of the impact of elastic
          bodies upon each other, merely in the understanding, merely for
          direct perception; and for him it is quite sufficient; but on the
          other hand it is only the man who has studied the science of
          mechanics, who has, properly speaking, a rational knowledge of
          these laws, that is, a knowledge of them in the abstract. Such
          knowledge of the understanding in perception is sufficient even for
          the construction of machines, when the inventor of the machine
          executes the work himself; as we often see in the case of talented
          workmen, who have no scientific knowledge. But whenever a number of
          men, and their united action taking place at different times, is
          required for the completion of a mechanical work, of a machine, or
          a building, then he who conducts it must have thought out the plan
          in the abstract, and such co-operative activity is only possible
          through the assistance of reason. It is, however, remarkable that
          in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page073">[pg 073]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg073"></a> the first kind of
          activity, in which we have supposed that one man alone, in an
          uninterrupted course of action, accomplishes something, abstract
          knowledge, the application of reason or reflection, may often be a
          hindrance to him; for example, in the case of billiard-playing, of
          fighting, of tuning an instrument, or in the case of singing. Here
          perceptive knowledge must directly guide action; its passage
          through reflection makes it uncertain, for it divides the attention
          and confuses the man. Thus savages and untaught men, who are little
          accustomed to think, perform certain physical exercises, fight with
          beasts, shoot with bows and arrows and the like, with a certainty
          and rapidity which the reflecting European never attains to, just
          because his deliberation makes him hesitate and delay. For he
          tries, for example, to hit the right position or the right point of
          time, by finding out the mean between two false extremes; while the
          savage hits it directly without thinking of the false courses open
          to him. In the same way it is of no use to me to know in the
          abstract the exact angle, in degrees and minutes, at which I must
          apply a razor, if I do not know it intuitively, that is, if I have
          not got it in my touch. The knowledge of physiognomy also, is
          interfered with by the application of reason. This knowledge must
          be gained directly through the understanding. We say that the
          expression, the meaning of the features, can only be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">felt</span></em>,
          that is, it cannot be put into abstract concepts. Every man has his
          direct intuitive method of physiognomy and pathognomy, yet one man
          understands more clearly than another these <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">signatura rerum</span></span>. But an abstract
          science of physiognomy to be taught and learned is not possible;
          for the distinctions of difference are here so fine that concepts
          cannot reach them; therefore abstract knowledge is related to them
          as a mosaic is to a painting by a Van der Werft or a Denner. In
          mosaics, however fine they may be, the limits of the stones are
          always there, and therefore no continuous passage from <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page074">[pg 074]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg074"></a> one colour to another is possible, and
          this is also the case with regard to concepts, with their rigidity
          and sharp delineation; however finely we may divide them by exact
          definition, they are still incapable of reaching the finer
          modifications of the perceptible, and this is just what happens in
          the example we have taken, knowledge of physiognomy.<a href="#note_16" id="noteref_16" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">16</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This quality of
          concepts by which they resemble the stones of a mosaic, and on
          account of which perception always remains their asymptote, is also
          the reason why nothing good is produced in art by their means. If
          the singer or the virtuoso attempts to guide his execution by
          reflection he remains silent. And this is equally true of the
          composer, the painter, and the poet. The concept always remains
          unfruitful in art; it can only direct the technical part of it, its
          sphere is science. We shall consider more fully in the third book,
          why all true art proceeds from sensuous knowledge, never from the
          concept. Indeed, with regard to behaviour also, and personal
          agreeableness in society, the concept has only a negative value in
          restraining the grosser manifestations of egotism and brutality; so
          that a polished manner is its commendable production. But all that
          is attractive, gracious, charming in behaviour, all
          affectionateness and friendliness, must not proceed from the
          concepts, for if it does, <span class="tei tei-q">“we feel
          intention, and are put out of tune.”</span> All dissimulation is
          the work of reflection; but it cannot be maintained constantly and
          without interruption: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">nemo</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page075">[pg 075]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg075"></a><span style="font-style: italic">potest
          personam diu ferre fictum</span></span>,”</span> says Seneca in his
          book <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">de clementia</span></span>;
          and so it is generally found out and loses its effect. Reason is
          needed in the full stress of life, where quick conclusions, bold
          action, rapid and sure comprehension are required, but it may
          easily spoil all if it gains the upper hand, and by perplexing
          hinders the intuitive, direct discovery, and grasp of the right by
          simple understanding, and thus induces irresolution.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lastly, virtue
          and holiness do not proceed from reflection, but from the inner
          depths of the will, and its relation to knowledge. The exposition
          of this belongs to another part of our work; this, however, I may
          remark here, that the dogmas relating to ethics may be the same in
          the reason of whole nations, but the action of every individual
          different; and the converse also holds good; action, we say, is
          guided by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">feelings</span></em>,—that is, simply not by
          concepts, but as a matter of fact by the ethical character. Dogmas
          occupy the idle reason; but action in the end pursues its own
          course independently of them, generally not according to abstract
          rules, but according to unspoken maxims, the expression of which is
          the whole man himself. Therefore, however different the religious
          dogmas of nations may be, yet in the case of all of them, a good
          action is accompanied by unspeakable satisfaction, and a bad action
          by endless remorse. No mockery can shake the former; no priest's
          absolution can deliver from the latter. Notwithstanding this, we
          must allow, that for the pursuit of a virtuous life, the
          application of reason is needful; only it is not its source, but
          has the subordinate function of preserving resolutions which have
          been made, of providing maxims to withstand the weakness of the
          moment, and give consistency to action. It plays the same part
          ultimately in art also, where it has just as little to do with the
          essential matter, but assists in carrying it out, for genius is not
          always at call, and yet the work must be completed in all its parts
          and rounded off to a whole.<a href="#note_17" id="noteref_17" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">17</span></span></a></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page076">[pg 076]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg076"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 13. All these
          discussions of the advantages and disadvantages of the application
          of reason are intended to show, that although abstract rational
          knowledge is the reflex of ideas of perception, and is founded on
          them, it is by no means in such entire congruity with them that it
          could everywhere take their place: indeed it never corresponds to
          them quite accurately. And thus, as we have seen, many human
          actions can only be performed by the help of reason and
          deliberation, and yet there are some which are better performed
          without its assistance. This very incongruity of sensuous and
          abstract knowledge, on account of which the latter always merely
          approximates to the former, as mosaic approximates to painting, is
          the cause of a very remarkable phenomenon which, like reason
          itself, is peculiar to human nature, and of which the explanations
          that have ever anew been attempted, are insufficient: I mean
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">laughter</span></em>. On account of the source
          of this phenomenon, we cannot avoid giving the explanation of it
          here, though it again interrupts the course of our work to do so.
          The cause of laughter in every case is simply the sudden perception
          of the incongruity between a concept and the real objects which
          have been thought through it in some relation, and laughter itself
          is just the expression of this incongruity. It often occurs in this
          way: two or more real objects are thought through <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em>
          concept, and the identity of the concept is transferred to the
          objects; it then becomes strikingly apparent from the entire
          difference of the objects in other respects, that the concept was
          only applicable to them from a one-sided point of view. It occurs
          just as often, however, that the incongruity between a single real
          object and the concept under which, from one point of view, it has
          rightly been subsumed, is suddenly felt. Now the more correct the
          subsumption of such objects under a concept may be from one point
          of view, and the greater and more glaring their incongruity with
          it, from another point of view, the greater is <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page077">[pg 077]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg077"></a> the ludicrous effect which is produced
          by this contrast. All laughter then is occasioned by a paradox, and
          therefore by unexpected subsumption, whether this is expressed in
          words or in actions. This, briefly stated, is the true explanation
          of the ludicrous.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I shall not
          pause here to relate anecdotes as examples to illustrate my theory;
          for it is so simple and comprehensible that it does not require
          them, and everything ludicrous which the reader may remember is
          equally valuable as a proof of it. But the theory is confirmed and
          illustrated by distinguishing two species into which the ludicrous
          is divided, and which result from the theory. Either, we have
          previously known two or more very different real objects, ideas of
          sense-perception, and have intentionally identified them through
          the unity of a concept which comprehends them both; this species of
          the ludicrous is called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">wit</span></em>. Or, conversely, the concept
          is first present in knowledge, and we pass from it to reality, and
          to operation upon it, to action: objects which in other respects
          are fundamentally different, but which are all thought in that one
          concept, are now regarded and treated in the same way, till, to the
          surprise and astonishment of the person acting, the great
          difference of their other aspects appears: this species of the
          ludicrous is called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">folly</span></em>. Therefore everything
          ludicrous is either a flash of wit or a foolish action, according
          as the procedure has been from the discrepancy of the objects to
          the identity of the concept, or the converse; the former always
          intentional, the latter always unintentional, and from without. To
          seem to reverse the starting-point, and to conceal wit with the
          mask of folly, is the art of the jester and the clown. Being quite
          aware of the diversity of the objects, the jester unites them, with
          secret wit, under one concept, and then starting from this concept
          he receives from the subsequently discovered diversity of the
          objects the surprise which he himself prepared. It follows from
          this short but <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page078">[pg
          078]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg078"></a>
          sufficient theory of the ludicrous, that, if we set aside the last
          case, that of the jester, wit must always show itself in words,
          folly generally in actions, though also in words, when it only
          expresses an intention and does not actually carry it out, or when
          it shows itself merely in judgments and opinions.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Pedantry</span></em> is a form of folly. It
          arises in this way: a man lacks confidence in his own
          understanding, and, therefore, does not wish to trust to it, to
          recognise what is right directly in the particular case. He,
          therefore, puts it entirely under the control of the reason, and
          seeks to be guided by reason in everything; that is to say, he
          tries always to proceed from general concepts, rules, and maxims,
          and to confine himself strictly to them in life, in art, and even
          in moral conduct. Hence that clinging to the form, to the manner,
          to the expression and word which is characteristic of pedantry, and
          which with it takes the place of the real nature of the matter. The
          incongruity then between the concept and reality soon shows itself
          here, and it becomes evident that the former never condescends to
          the particular case, and that with its generality and rigid
          definiteness it can never accurately apply to the fine distinctions
          of difference and innumerable modifications of the actual.
          Therefore, the pedant, with his general maxims, almost always
          misses the mark in life, shows himself to be foolish, awkward,
          useless. In art, in which the concept is unfruitful, he produces
          lifeless, stiff, abortive mannerisms. Even with regard to ethics,
          the purpose to act rightly or nobly cannot always be carried out in
          accordance with abstract maxims; for in many cases the excessively
          nice distinctions in the nature of the circumstances necessitate a
          choice of the right proceeding directly from the character; for the
          application of mere abstract maxims sometimes gives false results,
          because the maxims only half apply; and sometimes cannot be carried
          out, because they are foreign to the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page079">[pg 079]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg079"></a> individual character of the actor, and this
          never allows itself to be entirely discovered; therefore,
          inconsistencies arise. Since then Kant makes it a condition of the
          moral worth of an action, that it shall proceed from pure rational
          abstract maxims, without any inclination or momentary emotion, we
          cannot entirely absolve him from the reproach of encouraging moral
          pedantry. This reproach is the significance of Schiller's epigram,
          entitled <span class="tei tei-q">“Scruples of Conscience.”</span>
          When we speak, especially in connection with politics, of
          doctrinaires, theorists, savants, and so forth, we mean pedants,
          that is, persons who know the things well in the abstract, but not
          in the concrete. Abstraction consists in thinking away the less
          general predicates; but it is precisely upon these that so much
          depends in practice.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To complete our
          theory it remains for us to mention a spurious kind of wit, the
          play upon words, the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">calembourg</span></span>, the pun, to which
          may be added the equivocation, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">double
          entendre</span></em>, the chief use of which is the expression of
          what is obscene. Just as the witticism brings two very different
          real objects under one concept, the pun brings two different
          concepts, by the assistance of accident, under one word. The same
          contrast appears, only familiar and more superficial, because it
          does not spring from the nature of things, but merely from the
          accident of nomenclature. In the case of the witticism the identity
          is in the concept, the difference in the reality, but in the case
          of the pun the difference is in the concepts and the identity in
          the reality, for the terminology is here the reality. It would only
          be a somewhat far-fetched comparison if we were to say that the pun
          is related to the witticism as the parabola (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">sic</span></span>) of the upper inverted cone
          to that of the lower. The misunderstanding of the word or the
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">quid pro quo</span></span> is the
          unintentional pun, and is related to it exactly as folly is to wit.
          Thus the deaf man often affords occasion for laughter, just as much
          as the fool, and inferior writers <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page080">[pg 080]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg080"></a> of comedy often use the former for the latter
          to raise a laugh.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I have treated
          laughter here only from the psychical side; with regard to the
          physical side, I refer to what is said on the subject in the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Parerga,”</span> vol. II. ch. vi., §
          98.<a href="#note_18" id="noteref_18" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">18</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 14. By means
          of these various discussions it is hoped that both the difference
          and the relation between the process of knowledge that belongs to
          the reason, rational knowledge, the concept on the one hand, and
          the direct knowledge in purely sensuous, mathematical intuition or
          perception, and apprehension by the understanding on the other
          hand, has been clearly brought out. This remarkable relation of our
          kinds of knowledge led us almost inevitably to give, in passing,
          explanations of feeling and of laughter, but from all this we now
          turn back to the further consideration of science as the third
          great benefit which reason confers on man, the other two being
          speech and deliberate action. The general discussion of science
          which now devolves upon us, will be concerned partly with its form,
          partly with the foundation of its judgments, and lastly with its
          content.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have seen
          that, with the exception of the basis of pure logic, rational
          knowledge in general has not its source in the reason itself; but
          having been otherwise obtained as knowledge of perception, it is
          stored up in the reason, for through reason it has entirely changed
          its character, and has become abstract knowledge. All rational
          knowledge, that is, knowledge that has been raised to consciousness
          in the abstract, is related to science strictly so called, as a
          fragment to the whole. Every one has gained a rational knowledge of
          many different things through experience, through consideration of
          the individual objects presented to him, but only he who sets
          himself the task of acquiring a complete knowledge in the abstract
          of a particular class of objects, strives after science. This class
          can only be marked off <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page081">[pg
          081]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg081"></a>
          by means of a concept; therefore, at the beginning of every science
          there stands a concept, and by means of it the class of objects
          concerning which this science promises a complete knowledge in the
          abstract, is separated in thought from the whole world of things.
          For example, the concept of space-relations, or of the action of
          unorganised bodies upon each other, or of the nature of plants, or
          of animals, or of the successive changes of the surface of the
          globe, or of the changes of the human race as a whole, or of the
          construction of a language, and so forth. If science sought to
          obtain the knowledge of its object, by investigating each
          individual thing that is thought through the concept, till by
          degrees it had learned the whole, no human memory would be equal to
          the task, and no certainty of completeness would be obtainable.
          Therefore, it makes use of that property of concept-spheres
          explained above, that they include each other, and it concerns
          itself mainly with the wider spheres which lie within the concept
          of its object in general. When the relations of these spheres to
          each other have been determined, all that is thought in them is
          also generally determined, and can now be more and more accurately
          determined by the separation of smaller and smaller
          concept-spheres. In this way it is possible for a science to
          comprehend its object completely. This path which it follows to
          knowledge, the path from the general to the particular,
          distinguishes it from ordinary rational knowledge; therefore,
          systematic form is an essential and characteristic feature of
          science. The combination of the most general concept-spheres of
          every science, that is, the knowledge of its first principles, is
          the indispensable condition of mastering it; how far we advance
          from these to the more special propositions is a matter of choice,
          and does not increase the thoroughness but only the extent of our
          knowledge of the science. The number of the first principles to
          which all the rest are subordinated, varies greatly in the
          different sciences, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page082">[pg
          082]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg082"></a>
          so that in some there is more subordination, in others more
          co-ordination; and in this respect, the former make greater claims
          upon the judgment, the latter upon the memory. It was known to the
          schoolmen,<a href="#note_19" id="noteref_19" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">19</span></span></a> that,
          as the syllogism requires two premises, no science can proceed from
          a single first principle which cannot be the subject of further
          deduction, but must have several, at least two. The specially
          classifying sciences: Zoology, Botany, and also Physics and
          Chemistry, inasmuch as they refer all inorganic action to a few
          fundamental forces, have most subordination; history, on the other
          hand, has really none at all; for the general in it consists merely
          in the survey of the principal periods, from which, however, the
          particular events cannot be deduced, and are only subordinated to
          them according to time, but according to the concept are
          co-ordinate with them. Therefore, history, strictly speaking, is
          certainly rational knowledge, but is not science. In mathematics,
          according to Euclid's treatment, the axioms alone are
          indemonstrable first principles, and all demonstrations are in
          gradation strictly subordinated to them. But this method of
          treatment is not essential to mathematics, and in fact each
          proposition introduces quite a new space construction, which in
          itself is independent of those which precede it, and indeed can be
          completely comprehended from itself, quite independently of them,
          in the pure intuition or perception of space, in which the most
          complicated construction is just as directly evident as the axiom;
          but of this more fully hereafter. Meanwhile every mathematical
          proposition remains always a universal truth, which is valid for
          innumerable particular cases; and a graduated process from the
          simple to the complicated propositions which are to be deduced from
          them, is also essential to mathematics; therefore, in every respect
          mathematics is a science. The completeness of a science as such,
          that is, in respect of form, consists in there being as much
          subordination and as little <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page083">[pg 083]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg083"></a> co-ordination of the principles as possible.
          Scientific talent in general is, therefore, the faculty of
          subordinating the concept-spheres according to their different
          determinations, so that, as Plato repeatedly counsels, a science
          shall not be constituted by a general concept and an indefinite
          multiplicity immediately under it, but that knowledge shall descend
          by degrees from the general to the particular, through intermediate
          concepts and divisions, according to closer and closer definitions.
          In Kantian language this is called satisfying equally the law of
          homogeneity and that of specification. It arises from this peculiar
          nature of scientific completeness, that the aim of science is not
          greater certainty—for certainty may be possessed in just as high a
          degree by the most disconnected particular knowledge—but its aim is
          rather the facilitating of rational knowledge by means of its form,
          and the possibility of the completeness of rational knowledge which
          this form affords. It is therefore a very prevalent but perverted
          opinion that the scientific character of knowledge consists in its
          greater certainty, and just as false is the conclusion following
          from this, that, strictly speaking, the only sciences are
          mathematics and logic, because only in them, on account of their
          purely <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span>
          character, is there unassailable certainty of knowledge. This
          advantage cannot be denied them, but it gives them no special claim
          to be regarded as sciences; for the special characteristic of
          science does not lie in certainty but in the systematic form of
          knowledge, based on the gradual descent from the general to the
          particular. The process of knowledge from the general to the
          particular, which is peculiar to the sciences, involves the
          necessity that in the sciences much should be established by
          deduction from preceding propositions, that is to say, by
          demonstration; and this has given rise to the old mistake that only
          what has been demonstrated is absolutely true, and that every truth
          requires a demonstration; whereas, on the contrary, every
          demonstration <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page084">[pg
          084]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg084"></a>
          requires an undemonstrated truth, which ultimately supports it, or
          it may be, its own demonstration. Therefore a directly established
          truth is as much to be preferred to a truth established by
          demonstration as water from the spring is to water from the
          aqueduct. Perception, partly pure <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          priori</span></span>, as it forms the basis of mathematics, partly
          empirical <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a posteriori</span></span>,
          as it forms the basis of all the other sciences, is the source of
          all truth and the foundation of all science. (Logic alone is to be
          excepted, which is not founded upon perception but yet upon
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">direct</span></em> knowledge by the reason of
          its own laws.) Not the demonstrated judgments nor their
          demonstrations, but judgments which are created directly out of
          perception, and founded upon it rather than on any demonstrations,
          are to science what the sun is to the world; for all light proceeds
          from them, and lighted by their light the others give light also.
          To establish the truth of such primary judgments directly from
          perception, to raise such strongholds of science from the
          innumerable multitude of real objects, that is the work of the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">faculty
          of judgment</span></em>, which consists in the power of rightly and
          accurately carrying over into abstract consciousness what is known
          in perception, and judgment is consequently the mediator between
          understanding and reason. Only extraordinary and exceptional
          strength of judgment in the individual can actually advance
          science; but every one who is possessed of a healthy reason is able
          to deduce propositions from propositions, to demonstrate, to draw
          conclusions. To lay down and make permanent for reflection, in
          suitable concepts, what is known through perception, so that, on
          the one hand, what is common to many real objects is thought
          through <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> concept, and, on the other
          hand, their points of difference are each thought through one
          concept, so that the different shall be known and thought as
          different in spite of a partial agreement, and the identical shall
          be known and thought as identical in spite of a partial difference,
          all in accordance with the end and intention which in each case
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page085">[pg 085]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg085"></a> is in view; all this
          is done by the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">faculty of judgment</span></em>. Deficiency in
          judgment is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">silliness</span></em>. The silly man fails to
          grasp, now the partial or relative difference of concepts which in
          one aspect are identical, now the identity of concepts which are
          relatively or partially different. To this explanation of the
          faculty of judgment, moreover, Kant's division of it into
          reflecting and subsuming judgment may be applied, according as it
          passes from the perceived objects to the concepts, or from the
          latter to the former; in both cases always mediating between
          empirical knowledge of the understanding and the reflective
          knowledge of the reason. There can be no truth which could be
          brought out by means of syllogisms alone; and the necessity of
          establishing truth by means of syllogisms is merely relative,
          indeed subjective. Since all demonstration is syllogistic, in the
          case of a new truth we must first seek, not for a demonstration,
          but for direct evidence, and only in the absence of such evidence
          is a demonstration to be temporarily made use of. No science is
          susceptible of demonstration throughout any more than a building
          can stand in the air; all its demonstrations must ultimately rest
          upon what is perceived, and consequently cannot be demonstrated,
          for the whole world of reflection rests upon and is rooted in the
          world of perception. All primal, that is, original, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">evidence</span></em> is a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">perception</span></em>, as the word itself
          indicates. Therefore it is either empirical or founded upon the
          perception <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span> of the
          conditions of possible experience. In both cases it affords only
          immanent, not transcendent knowledge. Every concept has its worth
          and its existence only in its relation, sometimes very indirect, to
          an idea of perception; what is true of the concepts is also true of
          the judgments constructed out of them, and of all science.
          Therefore it must in some way be possible to know directly without
          demonstrations or syllogisms every truth that is arrived at through
          syllogisms and communicated by demonstrations. This is most
          difficult in the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page086">[pg
          086]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg086"></a>
          case of certain complicated mathematical propositions at which we
          only arrive by chains of syllogisms; for example, the calculation
          of the chords and tangents to all arcs by deduction from the
          proposition of Pythagoras. But even such a truth as this cannot
          essentially and solely rest upon abstract principles, and the
          space-relations which lie at its foundation also must be capable of
          being so presented <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          priori</span></span> in pure intuition or perception that the truth
          of their abstract expression is directly established. But of
          mathematical demonstration we shall speak more fully shortly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is true we
          often hear men speak in a lofty strain of sciences which rest
          entirely upon correct conclusions drawn from sure premises, and
          which are consequently unassailable. But through pure logical
          reasoning, however true the premises may be, we shall never receive
          more than an articulate expression and exposition of what lies
          already complete in the premises; thus we shall only <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">explicitly</span></em> expound what was
          already <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">implicitly</span></em> understood. The
          esteemed sciences referred to are, however, specially the
          mathematical sciences, particularly astronomy. But the certainty of
          astronomy arises from the fact that it has for its basis the
          intuition or perception of space, which is given <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span>, and is therefore
          infallible. All space-relations, however, follow from each other
          with a necessity (ground of being) which affords <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span> certainty, and they can
          therefore be safely deduced from each other. To these mathematical
          properties we have only to add one force of nature, gravity, which
          acts precisely in relation to the masses and the square of the
          distance; and, lastly, the law of inertia, which follows from the
          law of causality and is therefore true <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          priori</span></span>, and with it the empirical datum of the motion
          impressed, once for all, upon each of these masses. This is the
          whole material of astronomy, which both by its simplicity and its
          certainty leads to definite results, which are highly interesting
          on account of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page087">[pg
          087]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg087"></a>
          vastness and importance of the objects. For example, if I know the
          mass of a planet and the distance of its satellite from it, I can
          tell with certainty the period of the revolution of the latter
          according to Kepler's second law. But the ground of this law is,
          that with this distance only this velocity will both chain the
          satellite to the planet and prevent it from falling into it. Thus
          it is only upon such a geometrical basis, that is, by means of an
          intuition or perception <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          priori</span></span>, and also under the application of a law of
          nature, that much can be arrived at by means of syllogisms, for
          here they are merely like bridges from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em>
          sensuous apprehension to others; but it is not so with mere pure
          syllogistic reasoning in the exclusively logical method. The source
          of the first fundamental truths of astronomy is, however, properly
          induction, that is, the comprehension of what is given in many
          perceptions in one true and directly founded judgment. From this,
          hypotheses are afterwards constructed, and their confirmation by
          experience, as induction approaching to completeness, affords the
          proof of the first judgment. For example, the apparent motion of
          the planets is known empirically; after many false hypotheses with
          regard to the spacial connection of this motion (planetary course)
          the right one was at last found, then the laws which it obeyed (the
          laws of Kepler), and, lastly, the cause of these laws (universal
          gravitation), and the empirically known agreement of all observed
          cases with the whole of the hypotheses, and with their
          consequences, that is to say, induction, established them with
          complete certainty. The invention of the hypotheses was the work of
          the judgment, which rightly comprehended the given facts and
          expressed them accordingly; but induction, that is, a multitude of
          perceptions, confirmed their truth. But their truth could also be
          known directly, and by a single empirical perception, if we could
          pass freely through space and had telescopic eyes. Therefore, here
          also syllogisms are not <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page088">[pg
          088]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg088"></a>
          the essential and only source of knowledge, but really only a
          makeshift.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As a third
          example taken from a different sphere we may mention that the
          so-called metaphysical truths, that is, such truths as those to
          which Kant assigns the position of the metaphysical first
          principles of natural science, do not owe their evidence to
          demonstration. What is <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          priori</span></span> certain we know directly; as the form of all
          knowledge, it is known to us with the most complete necessity. For
          example, that matter is permanent, that is, can neither come into
          being nor pass away, we know directly as negative truth; for our
          pure intuition or perception of space and time gives the
          possibility of motion; in the law of causality the understanding
          affords us the possibility of change of form and quality, but we
          lack powers of the imagination for conceiving the coming into being
          or passing away of matter. Therefore that truth has at all times
          been evident to all men everywhere, nor has it ever been seriously
          doubted; and this could not be the case if it had no other ground
          of knowledge than the abstruse and exceedingly subtle proof of
          Kant. But besides this, I have found Kant's proof to be false (as
          is explained in the Appendix), and have shown above that the
          permanence of matter is to be deduced, not from the share which
          time has in the possibility of experience, but from the share which
          belongs to space. The true foundation of all truths which in this
          sense are called metaphysical, that is, abstract expressions of the
          necessary and universal forms of knowledge, cannot itself lie in
          abstract principles; but only in the immediate consciousness of the
          forms of the idea communicating itself in apodictic assertions
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span>, and fearing no
          refutation. But if we yet desire to give a proof of them, it can
          only consist in showing that what is to be proved is contained in
          some truth about which there is no doubt, either as a part of it or
          as a presupposition. Thus, for example, I have shown that all
          empirical perception implies the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page089">[pg 089]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg089"></a> application of the law of causality, the
          knowledge of which is hence a condition of all experience, and
          therefore cannot be first given and conditioned through experience
          as Hume thought. Demonstrations in general are not so much for
          those who wish to learn as for those who wish to dispute. Such
          persons stubbornly deny directly established insight; now only the
          truth can be consistent in all directions, and therefore we must
          show such persons that they admit under <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em>
          form and indirectly, what they deny under another form and
          directly; that is, the logically necessary connection between what
          is denied and what is admitted.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is also a
          consequence of the scientific form, the subordination of everything
          particular under a general, and so on always to what is more
          general, that the truth of many propositions is only logically
          proved,—that is, through their dependence upon other propositions,
          through syllogisms, which at the same time appear as proofs. But we
          must never forget that this whole form of science is merely a means
          of rendering knowledge more easy, not a means to greater certainty.
          It is easier to discover the nature of an animal, by means of the
          species to which it belongs, and so on through the genus, family,
          order, and class, than to examine on every occasion the animal
          presented to us: but the truth of all propositions arrived at
          syllogistically is always conditioned by and ultimately dependent
          upon some truth which rests not upon reasoning but upon perception.
          If this perception were always as much within our reach as a
          deduction through syllogisms, then it would be in every respect
          preferable. For every deduction from concepts is exposed to great
          danger of error, on account of the fact we have considered above,
          that so many spheres lie partly within each other, and that their
          content is often vague or uncertain. This is illustrated by a
          multitude of demonstrations of false doctrines and sophisms of
          every kind. Syllogisms are indeed perfectly certain as regards
          form, but they are <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page090">[pg
          090]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg090"></a>
          very uncertain on account of their matter, the concepts. For, on
          the one hand, the spheres of these are not sufficiently sharply
          defined, and, on the other hand, they intersect each other in so
          many ways that one sphere is in part contained in many others, and
          we may pass at will from it to one or another of these, and from
          this sphere again to others, as we have already shown. Or, in other
          words, the minor term and also the middle can always be
          subordinated to different concepts, from which we may choose at
          will the major and the middle, and the nature of the conclusion
          depends on this choice. Consequently immediate evidence is always
          much to be preferred to reasoned truth, and the latter is only to
          be accepted when the former is too remote, and not when it is as
          near or indeed nearer than the latter. Accordingly we saw above
          that, as a matter of fact, in the case of logic, in which the
          immediate knowledge in each individual case lies nearer to hand
          than deduced scientific knowledge, we always conduct our thought
          according to our immediate knowledge of the laws of thought, and
          leave logic unused.<a href="#note_20" id="noteref_20" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">20</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 15. If now
          with our conviction that perception is the primary source of all
          evidence, and that only direct or indirect connection with it is
          absolute truth; and further, that the shortest way to this is
          always the surest, as every interposition of concepts means
          exposure to many deceptions; if, I say, we now turn with this
          conviction to mathematics, as it was established as a science by
          Euclid, and has remained as a whole to our own day, we cannot help
          regarding the method it adopts, as strange and indeed perverted. We
          ask that every logical proof shall be traced back to an origin in
          perception; but mathematics, on the contrary, is at great pains
          deliberately to throw away the evidence of perception which is
          peculiar to it, and always at hand, that it may substitute for it a
          logical demonstration. This must seem to us <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page091">[pg 091]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg091"></a> like the action of a man who cuts off
          his legs in order to go on crutches, or like that of the prince in
          the <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Triumph der
          Empfindsamkeit</span></span>”</span> who flees from the beautiful
          reality of nature, to delight in a stage scene that imitates it. I
          must here refer to what I have said in the sixth chapter of the
          essay on the principle of sufficient reason, and take for granted
          that it is fresh and present in the memory of the reader; so that I
          may link my observations on to it without explaining again the
          difference between the mere ground of knowledge of a mathematical
          truth, which can be given logically, and the ground of being, which
          is the immediate connection of the parts of space and time, known
          only in perception. It is only insight into the ground of being
          that secures satisfaction and thorough knowledge. The mere ground
          of knowledge must always remain superficial; it can afford us
          indeed rational knowledge <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em> a thing is as it is, but it
          cannot tell <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">why</span></em> it is so. Euclid chose the
          latter way to the obvious detriment of the science. For just at the
          beginning, for example, when he ought to show once for all how in a
          triangle the angles and sides reciprocally determine each other,
          and stand to each other in the relation of reason and consequent,
          in accordance with the form which the principle of sufficient
          reason has in pure space, and which there, as in every other
          sphere, always affords the necessity that a thing is as it is,
          because something quite different from it, is as it is; instead of
          in this way giving a thorough insight into the nature of the
          triangle, he sets up certain disconnected arbitrarily chosen
          propositions concerning the triangle, and gives a logical ground of
          knowledge of them, through a laborious logical demonstration, based
          upon the principle of contradiction. Instead of an exhaustive
          knowledge of these space-relations we therefore receive merely
          certain results of them, imparted to us at pleasure, and in fact we
          are very much in the position of a man to whom the different
          effects of an ingenious <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page092">[pg
          092]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg092"></a>
          machine are shown, but from whom its inner connection and
          construction are withheld. We are compelled by the principle of
          contradiction to admit that what Euclid demonstrates is true, but
          we do not comprehend <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">why</span></em> it is so. We have therefore
          almost the same uncomfortable feeling that we experience after a
          juggling trick, and, in fact, most of Euclid's demonstrations are
          remarkably like such feats. The truth almost always enters by the
          back door, for it manifests itself <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">per accidens</span></span> through some
          contingent circumstance. Often a <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">reductio ad absurdum</span></span> shuts all
          the doors one after another, until only one is left through which
          we are therefore compelled to enter. Often, as in the proposition
          of Pythagoras, lines are drawn, we don't know why, and it
          afterwards appears that they were traps which close unexpectedly
          and take prisoner the assent of the astonished learner, who must
          now admit what remains wholly inconceivable in its inner
          connection, so much so, that he may study the whole of Euclid
          through and through without gaining a real insight into the laws of
          space-relations, but instead of them he only learns by heart
          certain results which follow from them. This specially empirical
          and unscientific knowledge is like that of the doctor who knows
          both the disease and the cure for it, but does not know the
          connection between them. But all this is the necessary consequence
          if we capriciously reject the special kind of proof and evidence of
          one species of knowledge, and forcibly introduce in its stead a
          kind which is quite foreign to its nature. However, in other
          respects the manner in which this has been accomplished by Euclid
          deserves all the praise which has been bestowed on him through so
          many centuries, and which has been carried so far that his method
          of treating mathematics has been set up as the pattern of all
          scientific exposition. Men tried indeed to model all the sciences
          after it, but later they gave up the attempt without quite knowing
          why. Yet in our eyes this method of Euclid in mathematics
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page093">[pg 093]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg093"></a> can appear only as a
          very brilliant piece of perversity. But when a great error in life
          or in science has been intentionally and methodically carried out
          with universal applause, it is always possible to discover its
          source in the philosophy which prevailed at the time. The Eleatics
          first brought out the difference, and indeed often the conflict,
          that exists between what is perceived, φαινομενον,<a href="#note_21" id="noteref_21" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">21</span></span></a> and
          what is thought, νουμενον, and used it in many ways in their
          philosophical epigrams, and also in sophisms. They were followed
          later by the Megarics, the Dialecticians, the Sophists, the
          New-Academy, and the Sceptics; these drew attention to the
          illusion, that is to say, to the deception of the senses, or rather
          of the understanding which transforms the data of the senses into
          perception, and which often causes us to see things to which the
          reason unhesitatingly denies reality; for example, a stick broken
          in water, and such like. It came to be known that sense-perception
          was not to be trusted unconditionally, and it was therefore hastily
          concluded that only rational, logical thought could establish
          truth; although Plato (in the Parmenides), the Megarics, Pyrrho,
          and the New-Academy, showed by examples (in the manner which was
          afterwards adopted by Sextus Empiricus) how syllogisms and concepts
          were also sometimes misleading, and indeed produced paralogisms and
          sophisms which arise much more easily and are far harder to explain
          than the illusion of sense-perception. However, this rationalism,
          which arose in opposition to empiricism, kept the upper hand, and
          Euclid constructed the science of mathematics in accordance with
          it. He was compelled by necessity to found the axioms upon evidence
          of perception (φαινομενον), but all the rest he based upon
          reasoning (νουμενον). His method reigned supreme through all the
          succeeding centuries, and it could not but do so as long as pure
          intuition or perception, <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          priori</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page094">[pg
          094]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg094"></a>
          was not distinguished from empirical perception. Certain passages
          from the works of Proclus, the commentator of Euclid, which Kepler
          translated into Latin in his book, <span class="tei tei-q">“De
          Harmonia Mundi,”</span> seem to show that he fully recognised this
          distinction. But Proclus did not attach enough importance to the
          matter; he merely mentioned it by the way, so that he remained
          unnoticed and accomplished nothing. Therefore, not till two
          thousand years later will the doctrine of Kant, which is destined
          to make such great changes in all the knowledge, thought, and
          action of European nations, produce this change in mathematics
          also. For it is only after we have learned from this great man that
          the intuitions or perceptions of space and time are quite different
          from empirical perceptions, entirely independent of any impression
          of the senses, conditioning it, not conditioned by it, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          are <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span>, and
          therefore are not exposed to the illusions of sense; only after we
          have learned this, I say, can we comprehend that Euclid's logical
          method of treating mathematics is a useless precaution, a crutch
          for sound legs, that it is like a wanderer who during the night
          mistakes a bright, firm road for water, and carefully avoiding it,
          toils over the broken ground beside it, content to keep from point
          to point along the edge of the supposed water. Only now can we
          affirm with certainty that what presents itself to us as necessary
          in the perception of a figure, does not come from the figure on the
          paper, which is perhaps very defectively drawn, nor from the
          abstract concept under which we think it, but immediately from the
          form of all knowledge of which we are conscious <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span>. This is always the
          principle of sufficient reason; here as the form of perception,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, space, it is the principle
          of the ground of being, the evidence and validity of which is,
          however, just as great and as immediate as that of the principle of
          the ground of knowing, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, logical certainty. Thus we
          need not and ought not to leave the peculiar province of
          mathematics <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page095">[pg
          095]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg095"></a>
          in order to put our trust only in logical proof, and seek to
          authenticate mathematics in a sphere which is quite foreign to it,
          that of concepts. If we confine ourselves to the ground peculiar to
          mathematics, we gain the great advantage that in it the rational
          knowledge <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em> something is, is one with the
          knowledge <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">why</span></em> it is so, whereas the method
          of Euclid entirely separates these two, and lets us know only the
          first, not the second. Aristotle says admirably in the Analyt.,
          post. i. 27: <span class="tei tei-q">“Ακριβεστερα δ᾽ επιστημη
          επιστημης και προτερα, ἡτε του ὁτι και του διοτι ἡ αυτη, αλλα μη
          χωρις του ὁτι, της του διοτι”</span> (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Subtilior autem et praestantior ea est
          scientia, quâ</span></span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">quod</span></span> <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">aliquid sit, et</span></span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">cur</span></span> <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">sit una simulque intelligimus non

In physics we are only
          satisfied when the knowledge that a thing is as it is is combined
          with the knowledge why it is so. To know that the mercury in the
          Torricellian tube stands thirty inches high is not really rational
          knowledge if we do not know that it is sustained at this height by
          the counterbalancing weight of the atmosphere. Shall we then be
          satisfied in mathematics with the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">qualitas occulta</span></span> of the circle
          that the segments of any two intersecting chords always contain
          equal rectangles? That it is so Euclid certainly demonstrates in
          the 35th Prop. of the Third Book; <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">why</span></em> it
          is so remains doubtful. In the same way the proposition of
          Pythagoras teaches us a <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">qualitas occulta</span></span> of the
          right-angled triangle; the stilted and indeed fallacious
          demonstration of Euclid forsakes us at the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">why</span></em>,
          and a simple figure, which we already know, and which is present to
          us, gives at a glance far more insight into the matter, and firm
          inner conviction of that necessity, and of the dependence of that
          quality upon the right angle:—</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the case of
          unequal catheti also, and indeed generally in the case of every
          possible geometrical truth, it is quite possible to obtain such a
          conviction based on perception, because these truths were always
          discovered by such an empirically known necessity, and their
          demonstration was only thought out afterwards in addition. Thus we
          only require an analysis of the process of thought in the first
          discovery of a geometrical truth in order to know its necessity
          empirically. It is the analytical method in general that I wish for
          the exposition of mathematics, instead of the synthetical method
          which Euclid made use of. Yet this would have very great, though
          not insuperable, difficulties in the case of complicated
          mathematical truths. Here and there in Germany men are beginning to
          alter the exposition of mathematics, and to proceed more in this
          analytical way. The greatest effort in this direction has been made
          by Herr Kosack, teacher of mathematics and physics in the Gymnasium
          at Nordhausen, who added a thorough attempt to teach geometry
          according to my principles to the programme of the school
          examination on the 6th of April 1852.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In order to
          improve the method of mathematics, it is especially necessary to
          overcome the prejudice that demonstrated truth has any superiority
          over what is known through perception, or that logical truth
          founded upon the principle of contradiction has any superiority
          over metaphysical truth, which is immediately evident, and to which
          belongs the pure intuition or perception of space.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That which is
          most certain, and yet always inexplicable, is what is involved in
          the principle of sufficient reason, for this principle, in its
          different aspects, expresses the universal form of all our ideas
          and knowledge. All explanation consists of reduction to it,
          exemplification in the particular case of the connection of ideas
          expressed generally through it. It is thus the principle of all
          explanation, and therefore it is neither susceptible of an
          explanation itself, nor does it stand in need of it; for
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page097">[pg 097]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg097"></a> every explanation
          presupposes it, and only obtains meaning through it. Now, none of
          its forms are superior to the rest; it is equally certain and
          incapable of demonstration as the principle of the ground of being,
          or of change, or of action, or of knowing. The relation of reason
          and consequent is a necessity in all its forms, and indeed it is,
          in general, the source of the concept of necessity, for necessity
          has no other meaning. If the reason is given there is no other
          necessity than that of the consequent, and there is no reason that
          does not involve the necessity of the consequent. Just as surely
          then as the consequent expressed in the conclusion follows from the
          ground of knowledge given in the premises, does the ground of being
          in space determine its consequent in space: if I know through
          perception the relation of these two, this certainty is just as
          great as any logical certainty. But every geometrical proposition
          is just as good an expression of such a relation as one of the
          twelve axioms; it is a metaphysical truth, and as such, just as
          certain as the principle of contradiction itself, which is a
          metalogical truth, and the common foundation of all logical
          demonstration. Whoever denies the necessity, exhibited for
          intuition or perception, of the space-relations expressed in any
          proposition, may just as well deny the axioms, or that the
          conclusion follows from the premises, or, indeed, he may as well
          deny the principle of contradiction itself, for all these relations
          are equally undemonstrable, immediately evident and known
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span>. For any one to wish to
          derive the necessity of space-relations, known in intuition or
          perception, from the principle of contradiction by means of a
          logical demonstration is just the same as for the feudal superior
          of an estate to wish to hold it as the vassal of another. Yet this
          is what Euclid has done. His axioms only, he is compelled to leave
          resting upon immediate evidence; all the geometrical truths which
          follow are demonstrated logically, that is to say, from
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page098">[pg 098]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg098"></a> the agreement of the
          assumptions made in the proposition with the axioms which are
          presupposed, or with some earlier proposition; or from the
          contradiction between the opposite of the proposition and the
          assumptions made in it, or the axioms, or earlier propositions, or
          even itself. But the axioms themselves have no more immediate
          evidence than any other geometrical problem, but only more
          simplicity on account of their smaller content.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When a criminal
          is examined, a <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">procès-verbal</span></span> is made of his
          statement in order that we may judge of its truth from its
          consistency. But this is only a makeshift, and we are not satisfied
          with it if it is possible to investigate the truth of each of his
          answers for itself; especially as he might lie consistently from
          the beginning. But Euclid investigated space according to this
          first method. He set about it, indeed, under the correct assumption
          that nature must everywhere be consistent, and that therefore it
          must also be so in space, its fundamental form. Since then the
          parts of space stand to each other in a relation of reason and
          consequent, no single property of space can be different from what
          it is without being in contradiction with all the others. But this
          is a very troublesome, unsatisfactory, and roundabout way to
          follow. It prefers indirect knowledge to direct, which is just as
          certain, and it separates the knowledge that a thing is from the
          knowledge why it is, to the great disadvantage of the science; and
          lastly, it entirely withholds from the beginner insight into the
          laws of space, and indeed renders him unaccustomed to the special
          investigation of the ground and inner connection of things,
          inclining him to be satisfied with a mere historical knowledge that
          a thing is as it is. The exercise of acuteness which this method is
          unceasingly extolled as affording consists merely in this, that the
          pupil practises drawing conclusions, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          he practises applying the principle of contradiction, but specially
          he exerts his memory to retain all those data whose agreement is to
          be tested. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page099">[pg
          099]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg099"></a>
          Moreover, it is worth noticing that this method of proof was
          applied only to geometry and not to arithmetic. In arithmetic the
          truth is really allowed to come home to us through perception
          alone, which in it consists simply in counting. As the perception
          of numbers is in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">time alone</span></em>, and therefore cannot
          be represented by a sensuous schema like the geometrical figure,
          the suspicion that perception is merely empirical, and possibly
          illusive, disappeared in arithmetic, and the introduction of the
          logical method of proof into geometry was entirely due to this
          suspicion. As time has only one dimension, counting is the only
          arithmetical operation, to which all others may be reduced; and yet
          counting is just intuition or perception <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          priori</span></span>, to which there is no hesitation in appealing
          here, and through which alone everything else, every sum and every
          equation, is ultimately proved. We prove, for example, not that (7
          + 9 × 8 - 2)/3 = 42; but we refer to the pure perception in time,
          counting thus makes each individual problem an axiom. Instead of
          the demonstrations that fill geometry, the whole content of
          arithmetic and algebra is thus simply a method of abbreviating
          counting. We mentioned above that our immediate perception of
          numbers in time extends only to about ten. Beyond this an abstract
          concept of the numbers, fixed by a word, must take the place of the
          perception; which does not therefore actually occur any longer, but
          is only indicated in a thoroughly definite manner. Yet even so, by
          the important assistance of the system of figures which enables us
          to represent all larger numbers by the same small ones, intuitive
          or perceptive evidence of every sum is made possible, even where we
          make such use of abstraction that not only the numbers, but
          indefinite quantities and whole operations are thought only in the
          abstract and indicated as so thought, as [sqrt](r^b) so that we do
          not perform them, but merely symbolise them.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We might
          establish truth in geometry also, through <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page100">[pg 100]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg100"></a> pure <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          priori</span></span> perception, with the same right and certainty
          as in arithmetic. It is in fact always this necessity, known
          through perception in accordance with the principle of sufficient
          reason of being, which gives to geometry its principal evidence,
          and upon which in the consciousness of every one, the certainty of
          its propositions rests. The stilted logical demonstration is always
          foreign to the matter, and is generally soon forgotten, without
          weakening our conviction. It might indeed be dispensed with
          altogether without diminishing the evidence of geometry, for this
          is always quite independent of such demonstration, which never
          proves anything we are not convinced of already, through another
          kind of knowledge. So far then it is like a cowardly soldier, who
          adds a wound to an enemy slain by another, and then boasts that he
          slew him himself.<a href="#note_22" id="noteref_22" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">22</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After all this
          we hope there will be no doubt that the evidence of mathematics,
          which has become the pattern and symbol of all evidence, rests
          essentially not upon demonstration, but upon immediate perception,
          which is thus here, as everywhere else, the ultimate ground and
          source of truth. Yet the perception which lies at the basis of
          mathematics has a great advantage over all other perception, and
          therefore over empirical perception. It is <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          priori</span></span>, and therefore independent of experience,
          which is always given only in successive parts; therefore
          everything is equally near to it, and we can start either from the
          reason or from the consequent, as we please. Now this makes it
          absolutely reliable, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page101">[pg
          101]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg101"></a>
          for in it the consequent is known from the reason, and this is the
          only kind of knowledge that has necessity; for example, the
          equality of the sides is known as established by the equality of
          the angles. All empirical perception, on the other hand, and the
          greater part of experience, proceeds conversely from the consequent
          to the reason, and this kind of knowledge is not infallible, for
          necessity only attaches to the consequent on account of the reason
          being given, and no necessity attaches to the knowledge of the
          reason from the consequent, for the same consequent may follow from
          different reasons. The latter kind of knowledge is simply
          induction, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, from many consequents
          which point to one reason, the reason is accepted as certain; but
          as the cases can never be all before us, the truth here is not
          unconditionally certain. But all knowledge through
          sense-perception, and the great bulk of experience, has only this
          kind of truth. The affection of one of the senses induces the
          understanding to infer a cause of the effect, but, as a conclusion
          from the consequent to the reason is never certain, illusion, which
          is deception of the senses, is possible, and indeed often occurs,
          as was pointed out above. Only when several of the senses, or it
          may be all the five, receive impressions which point to the same
          cause, the possibility of illusion is reduced to a minimum; but yet
          it still exists, for there are cases, for example, the case of
          counterfeit money, in which all the senses are deceived. All
          empirical knowledge, and consequently the whole of natural science,
          is in the same position, except only the pure, or as Kant calls it,
          metaphysical part of it. Here also the causes are known from the
          effects, consequently all natural philosophy rests upon hypotheses,
          which are often false, and must then gradually give place to more
          correct ones. Only in the case of purposely arranged experiments,
          knowledge proceeds from the cause to the effect, that is, it
          follows the method that affords certainty; but these experiments
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page102">[pg 102]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg102"></a> themselves are
          undertaken in consequence of hypotheses. Therefore, no branch of
          natural science, such as physics, or astronomy, or physiology could
          be discovered all at once, as was the case with mathematics and
          logic, but required and requires the collected and compared
          experiences of many centuries. In the first place, repeated
          confirmation in experience brings the induction, upon which the
          hypothesis rests, so near completeness that in practice it takes
          the place of certainty, and is regarded as diminishing the value of
          the hypothesis, its source, just as little as the
          incommensurability of straight and curved lines diminishes the
          value of the application of geometry, or that perfect exactness of
          the logarithm, which is not attainable, diminishes the value of
          arithmetic. For as the logarithm, or the squaring of the circle,
          approaches infinitely near to correctness through infinite
          fractions, so, through manifold experience, the induction,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the knowledge of the cause
          from the effects, approaches, not infinitely indeed, but yet so
          near mathematical evidence, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, knowledge of the effects
          from the cause, that the possibility of mistake is small enough to
          be neglected, but yet the possibility exists; for example, a
          conclusion from an indefinite number of cases to all cases,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, to the unknown ground on
          which all depend, is an induction. What conclusion of this kind
          seems more certain than that all men have the heart on the left
          side? Yet there are extremely rare and quite isolated exceptions of
          men who have the heart upon the right side. Sense-perception and
          empirical science have, therefore, the same kind of evidence. The
          advantage which mathematics, pure natural science, and logic have
          over them, as <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span>
          knowledge, rests merely upon this, that the formal element in
          knowledge upon which all that is <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          priori</span></span> is based, is given as a whole and at once, and
          therefore in it we can always proceed from the cause to the effect,
          while in the former kind of knowledge we are generally obliged to
          proceed from the effect to the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page103">[pg 103]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg103"></a> cause. In other respects, the law of
          causality, or the principle of sufficient reason of change, which
          guides empirical knowledge, is in itself just as certain as the
          other forms of the principle of sufficient reason which are
          followed by the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span>
          sciences referred to above. Logical demonstrations from concepts or
          syllogisms have the advantage of proceeding from the reason to the
          consequent, just as much as knowledge through perception
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span>, and therefore in
          themselves, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, according to their form,
          they are infallible. This has greatly assisted to bring
          demonstration in general into such esteem. But this infallibility
          is merely relative; the demonstration merely subsumes under the
          first principles of the science, and it is these which contain the
          whole material truth of science, and they must not themselves be
          demonstrated, but must be founded on perception. In the few
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span> sciences we have named
          above, this perception is pure, but everywhere else it is
          empirical, and is only raised to universality through induction.
          If, then, in the empirical sciences also, the particular is proved
          from the general, yet the general, on the other hand, has received
          its truth from the particular; it is only a store of collected
          material, not a self-constituted foundation.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So much for the
          foundation of truth. Of the source and possibility of error many
          explanations have been tried since Plato's metaphorical solution of
          the dove-cot where the wrong pigeons are caught, &amp;c.
          (Theætetus, p. 167, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">et seq.</span></span>) Kant's vague,
          indefinite explanation of the source of error by means of the
          diagram of diagonal motion, will be found in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Critique of Pure Reason,”</span> p. 294 of the first
          edition, and p. 350 of the fifth. As truth is the relation of a
          judgment to its ground of knowledge, it is always a problem how the
          person judging can believe that he has such a ground of knowledge
          and yet not have it; that is to say, how error, the deception of
          reason, is possible. I find this possibility quite analogous to
          that of illusion, or the deception of the understanding,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page104">[pg 104]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg104"></a> which has been
          explained above. My opinion is (and this is what gives this
          explanation its proper place here) that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">every error is an
          inference from the consequent to the reason</span></em>, which
          indeed is valid when we know that the consequent has that reason
          and can have no other; but otherwise is not valid. The person who
          falls into error, either attributes to a consequent a reason which
          it cannot have, in which case he shows actual deficiency of
          understanding, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, deficiency in the capacity
          for immediate knowledge of the connection between the cause and the
          effect, or, as more frequently happens, he attributes to the effect
          a cause which is possible, but he adds to the major proposition of
          the syllogism, in which he infers the cause from the effect, that
          this effect <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">always</span></em> results only from this
          cause. Now he could only be assured of this by a complete
          induction, which, however, he assumes without having made it. This
          <span class="tei tei-q">“always”</span> is therefore too wide a
          concept, and instead of it he ought to have used <span class="tei tei-q">“sometimes”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“generally.”</span> The conclusion would then be
          problematical, and therefore not erroneous. That the man who errs
          should proceed in this way is due either to haste, or to
          insufficient knowledge of what is possible, on account of which he
          does not know the necessity of the induction that ought to be made.
          Error then is quite analogous to illusion. Both are inferences from
          the effect to the cause; the illusion brought about always in
          accordance with the law of causality, and by the understanding
          alone, thus directly, in perception itself; the error in accordance
          with all the forms of the principle of sufficient reason, and by
          the reason, thus in thought itself; yet most commonly in accordance
          with the law of causality, as will appear from the three following
          examples, which may be taken as types or representatives of the
          three kinds of error. (1.) The illusion of the senses (deception of
          the understanding) induces error (deception of the reason); for
          example, if one mistakes a painting for an alto-relief, and
          actually <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page105">[pg
          105]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg105"></a>
          takes it for such; the error results from a conclusion from the
          following major premise: <span class="tei tei-q">“If dark grey
          passes regularly through all shades to white; the cause is
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">always</span></em> the light, which strikes
          differently upon projections and depressions, <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ergo</span></span>—.”</span> (2.) <span class="tei tei-q">“If there is no money in my safe, the cause is
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">always</span></em> that my servant has got a
          key for it: <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ergo</span></span>—.”</span>
          (3.) <span class="tei tei-q">“If a ray of sunlight, broken through
          a prism, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, bent up or down, appears
          as a coloured band instead of round and white as before, the cause
          must always be that light consists of homogeneous rays, differently
          coloured and refrangible to different degrees, which, when forced
          asunder on account of the difference of their refrangibility, give
          an elongated and variously-coloured spectrum: <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ergo—bibamus!</span></span>”</span>—It must be
          possible to trace every error to such a conclusion, drawn from a
          major premise which is often only falsely generalised,
          hypothetical, and founded on the assumption that some particular
          cause is that of a certain effect. Only certain mistakes in
          counting are to be excepted, and they are not really errors, but
          merely mistakes. The operation prescribed by the concepts of the
          numbers has not been carried out in pure intuition or perception,
          in counting, but some other operation instead of it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As regards the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">content</span></em> of the sciences generally,
          it is, in fact, always the relation of the phenomena of the world
          to each other, according to the principle of sufficient reason,
          under the guidance of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">why</span></em>, which has validity and
          meaning only through this principle. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Explanation</span></em> is the establishment
          of this relation. Therefore explanation can never go further than
          to show two ideas standing to each other in the relation peculiar
          to that form of the principle of sufficient reason which reigns in
          the class to which they belong. If this is done we cannot further
          be asked the question, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">why</span></em>: for the relation proved is
          that one which absolutely cannot be imagined as other than it is,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, it is the form of all
          knowledge. Therefore we do not ask why 2 + 2 = 4; or why the
          equality of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page106">[pg
          106]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg106"></a>
          angles of a triangle determines the equality of the sides; or why
          its effect follows any given cause; or why the truth of the
          conclusion is evident from the truth of the premises. Every
          explanation which does not ultimately lead to a relation of which
          no <span class="tei tei-q">“why”</span> can further be demanded,
          stops at an accepted <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">qualitas
          occulta</span></span>; but this is the character of every original
          force of nature. Every explanation in natural science must
          ultimately end with such a <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">qualitas
          occulta</span></span>, and thus with complete obscurity. It must
          leave the inner nature of a stone just as much unexplained as that
          of a human being; it can give as little account of the weight, the
          cohesion, the chemical qualities, &amp;c., of the former, as of the
          knowing and acting of the latter. Thus, for example, weight is a
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">qualitas occulta</span></span>, for it can be
          thought away, and does not proceed as a necessity from the form of
          knowledge; which, on the contrary, is not the case with the law of
          inertia, for it follows from the law of causality, and is therefore
          sufficiently explained if it is referred to that law. There are two
          things which are altogether inexplicable,—that is to say, do not
          ultimately lead to the relation which the principle of sufficient
          reason expresses. These are, first, the principle of sufficient
          reason itself in all its four forms, because it is the principle of
          all explanation, which has meaning only in relation to it;
          secondly, that to which this principle does not extend, but which
          is the original source of all phenomena; the thing-in-itself, the
          knowledge of which is not subject to the principle of sufficient
          reason. We must be content for the present not to understand this
          thing-in-itself, for it can only be made intelligible by means of
          the following book, in which we shall resume this consideration of
          the possible achievements of the sciences. But at the point at
          which natural science, and indeed every science, leaves things,
          because not only its explanation of them, but even the principle of
          this explanation, the principle of sufficient reason, does not
          extend beyond this point; there philosophy <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page107">[pg 107]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg107"></a> takes them up and treats them after its own
          method, which is quite distinct from the method of science. In my
          essay on the principle of sufficient reason, § 51, I have shown how
          in the different sciences the chief guiding clue is one or other
          form of that principle; and, in fact, perhaps the most appropriate
          classification of the sciences might be based upon this
          circumstance. Every explanation arrived at by the help of this clue
          is, as we have said, merely relative; it explains things in
          relation to each other, but something which indeed is presupposed
          is always left unexplained. In mathematics, for example, this is
          space and time; in mechanics, physics, and chemistry it is matter,
          qualities, original forces and laws of nature; in botany and
          zoology it is the difference of species, and life itself; in
          history it is the human race with all its properties of thought and
          will: in all it is that form of the principle of sufficient reason
          which is respectively applicable. It is peculiar to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">philosophy</span></em> that it presupposes
          nothing as known, but treats everything as equally external and a
          problem; not merely the relations of phenomena, but also the
          phenomena themselves, and even the principle of sufficient reason
          to which the other sciences are content to refer everything. In
          philosophy nothing would be gained by such a reference, as one
          member of the series is just as external to it as another; and,
          moreover, that kind of connection is just as much a problem for
          philosophy as what is joined together by it, and the latter again
          is just as much a problem after its combination has been explained
          as before it. For, as we have said, just what the sciences
          presuppose and lay down as the basis and the limits of their
          explanation, is precisely and peculiarly the problem of philosophy,
          which may therefore be said to begin where science ends. It cannot
          be founded upon demonstrations, for they lead from known principles
          to unknown, but everything is equally unknown and external to
          philosophy. There can be no principle in consequence of which the
          world with <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page108">[pg
          108]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg108"></a>
          all its phenomena first came into existence, and therefore it is
          not possible to construct, as Spinoza wished, a philosophy which
          demonstrates <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ex firmis
          principiis</span></span>. Philosophy is the most general rational
          knowledge, the first principles of which cannot therefore be
          derived from another principle still more general. The principle of
          contradiction establishes merely the agreement of concepts, but
          does not itself produce concepts. The principle of sufficient
          reason explains the connections of phenomena, but not the phenomena
          themselves; therefore philosophy cannot proceed upon these
          principles to seek a <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">causa
          efficiens</span></span> or a <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">causa finalis</span></span> of the whole
          world. My philosophy, at least, does not by any means seek to know
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">whence</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">wherefore</span></em> the world exists, but
          merely <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">what</span></em> the world is. But the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">why</span></em> is here subordinated to the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">what</span></em>, for it already belongs to
          the world, as it arises and has meaning and validity only through
          the form of its phenomena, the principle of sufficient reason. We
          might indeed say that every one knows what the world is without
          help, for he is himself that subject of knowledge of which the
          world is the idea; and so far this would be true. But that
          knowledge is empirical, is in the concrete; the task of philosophy
          is to reproduce this in the abstract to raise to permanent rational
          knowledge the successive changing perceptions, and in general, all
          that is contained under the wide concept of feeling and merely
          negatively defined as not abstract, distinct, rational knowledge.
          It must therefore consist of a statement in the abstract, of the
          nature of the whole world, of the whole, and of all the parts. In
          order then that it may not lose itself in the endless multitude of
          particular judgments, it must make use of abstraction and think
          everything individual in the universal, and its differences also in
          the universal. It must therefore partly separate and partly unite,
          in order to present to rational knowledge the whole manifold of the
          world generally, according to its nature, comprehended in a few
          abstract concepts. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page109">[pg
          109]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg109"></a>
          Through these concepts, in which it fixes the nature of the world,
          the whole individual must be known as well as the universal, the
          knowledge of both therefore must be bound together to the minutest
          point. Therefore the capacity for philosophy consists just in that
          in which Plato placed it, the knowledge of the one in the many, and
          the many in the one. Philosophy will therefore be a sum-total of
          general judgments, whose ground of knowledge is immediately the
          world itself in its entirety, without excepting anything; thus all
          that is to be found in human consciousness; it will be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a complete
          recapitulation, as it were, a reflection, of the world in abstract
          concepts</span></em>, which is only possible by the union of the
          essentially identical in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> concept and the relegation of
          the different to another. This task was already prescribed to
          philosophy by Bacon of Verulam when he said: <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ea
          demum vera est philosophia, quae mundi ipsius voces fidelissime
          reddit, et veluti dictante mundo conscripta est, et nihil aliud
          est, quam ejusdem</span></span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">simulacrum et
          reflectio</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">neque addit quidquam
          de proprio, sed tantum iterat et resonat</span></span> (De Augm.
          Scient., L. 2, c. 13). But we take this in a wider sense than Bacon
          could then conceive.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The agreement
          which all the sides and parts of the world have with each other,
          just because they belong to a whole, must also be found in this
          abstract copy of it. Therefore the judgments in this sum-total
          could to a certain extent be deduced from each other, and indeed
          always reciprocally so deduced. Yet to make the first judgment
          possible, they must all be present, and thus implied as prior to it
          in the knowledge of the world in the concrete, especially as all
          direct proof is more certain than indirect proof; their harmony
          with each other by virtue of which they come together into the
          unity of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> thought, and which arises from
          the harmony and unity of the world of perception itself, which is
          their common ground of knowledge, is not therefore to be made use
          of to establish them, as that which is prior to them, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page110">[pg 110]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg110"></a> but is only added as a confirmation of
          their truth. This problem itself can only become quite clear in
          being solved.<a href="#note_23" id="noteref_23" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">23</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 16. After this
          full consideration of reason as a special faculty of knowledge
          belonging to man alone, and the results and phenomena peculiar to
          human nature brought about by it, it still remains for me to speak
          of reason, so far as it is the guide of human action, and in this
          respect may be called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">practical</span></em>. But what there is to
          say upon this point has found its place elsewhere in the appendix
          to this work, where I controvert the existence of the so-called
          practical reason of Kant, which he (certainly very conveniently)
          explained as the immediate source of virtue, and as the seat of an
          absolute (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, fallen from heaven)
          imperative. The detailed and thorough refutation of this Kantian
          principle of morality I have given later in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Fundamental Problems of Ethics.”</span> There remains,
          therefore, but little for me to say here about the actual influence
          of reason, in the true sense of the word, upon action. At the
          commencement of our treatment of reason we remarked, in general
          terms, how much the action and behaviour of men differs from that
          of brutes, and that this difference is to be regarded as entirely
          due to the presence of abstract concepts in consciousness. The
          influence of these upon our whole existence is so penetrating and
          significant that, on account of them, we are related to the lower
          animals very much as those animals that see are related to those
          that have no eyes (certain larvae, worms, and zoophytes). Animals
          without eyes know only by touch what is immediately present to them
          in space, what comes into contact with them; those which see, on
          the contrary, know a wide circle of near and distant objects. In
          the same way the absence of reason confines the lower animals to
          the ideas of perception, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the real objects which are
          immediately present to them in time; we, on the contrary, on
          account <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page111">[pg
          111]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg111"></a>
          of knowledge in the abstract, comprehend not only the narrow actual
          present, but also the whole past and future, and the wide sphere of
          the possible; we view life freely on all its sides, and go far
          beyond the present and the actual. Thus what the eye is in space
          and for sensuous knowledge, reason is, to a certain extent, in time
          and for inner knowledge. But as the visibility of objects has its
          worth and meaning only in the fact that it informs us of their
          tangibility, so the whole worth of abstract knowledge always
          consists in its relation to what is perceived. Therefore men
          naturally attach far more worth to immediate and perceived
          knowledge than to abstract concepts, to that which is merely
          thought; they place empirical knowledge before logical. But this is
          not the opinion of men who live more in words than in deeds, who
          have seen more on paper and in books than in actual life, and who
          in their greatest degeneracy become pedants and lovers of the mere
          letter. Thus only is it conceivable that Leibnitz and Wolf and all
          their successors could go so far astray as to explain knowledge of
          perception, after the example of Duns Scotus, as merely confused
          abstract knowledge! To the honour of Spinoza, I must mention that
          his truer sense led him, on the contrary, to explain all general
          concepts as having arisen from the confusion of that which was
          known in perception (Eth. II., prop. 40, Schol. 1). It is also a
          result of perverted opinion that in mathematics the evidence proper
          to it was rejected, and logical evidence alone accepted; that
          everything in general which was not abstract knowledge was
          comprehended under the wide name of feeling, and consequently was
          little valued; and lastly that the Kantian ethics regarded the good
          will which immediately asserts itself upon knowledge of the
          circumstances, and guides to right and good action as mere feeling
          and emotion, and consequently as worthless and without merit, and
          would <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page112">[pg 112]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg112"></a> only recognise
          actions which proceed from abstract maxims as having moral
          worth.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The many-sided
          view of life as a whole which man, as distinguished from the lower
          animals, possesses through reason, may be compared to a
          geometrical, colourless, abstract, reduced plan of his actual life.
          He, therefore, stands to the lower animals as the navigator who, by
          means of chart, compass, and quadrant, knows accurately his course
          and his position at any time upon the sea, stands to the uneducated
          sailors who see only the waves and the heavens. Thus it is worth
          noticing, and indeed wonderful, how, besides his life in the
          concrete, man always lives another life in the abstract. In the
          former he is given as a prey to all the storms of actual life, and
          to the influence of the present; he must struggle, suffer, and die
          like the brute. But his life in the abstract, as it lies before his
          rational consciousness, is the still reflection of the former, and
          of the world in which he lives; it is just that reduced chart or
          plan to which we have referred. Here in the sphere of quiet
          deliberation, what completely possessed him and moved him intensely
          before, appears to him cold, colourless, and for the moment
          external to him; he is merely the spectator, the observer. In
          respect of this withdrawal into reflection he may be compared to an
          actor who has played his part in one scene, and who takes his place
          among the audience till it is time for him to go upon the stage
          again, and quietly looks on at whatever may happen, even though it
          be the preparation for his own death (in the piece), but afterwards
          he again goes on the stage and acts and suffers as he must. From
          this double life proceeds that quietness peculiar to human beings,
          so very different from the thoughtlessness of the brutes, and with
          which, in accordance with previous reflection, or a formed
          determination, or a recognised necessity, a man suffers or
          accomplishes in cold blood, what is of the utmost and often
          terrible importance to him; suicide, execution, the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page113">[pg 113]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg113"></a> duel, enterprises of every kind fraught
          with danger to life, and, in general, things against which his
          whole animal nature rebels. Under such circumstances we see to what
          an extent reason has mastered the animal nature, and we say to the
          strong: σιδηρειον νυ τοι ἡτορ! (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ferreum certe tibi cor</span></span>), Il. 24,
          521. Here we can say truly that reason manifests itself
          practically, and thus wherever action is guided by reason, where
          the motives are abstract concepts, wherever we are not determined
          by particular ideas of perception, nor by the impression of the
          moment which guides the brutes, there <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">practical
          reason</span></em> shows itself. But I have fully explained in the
          Appendix, and illustrated by examples, that this is entirely
          different from and unrelated to the ethical worth of actions; that
          rational action and virtuous action are two entirely different
          things; that reason may just as well find itself in connection with
          great evil as with great good, and by its assistance may give great
          power to the one as well as to the other; that it is equally ready
          and valuable for the methodical and consistent carrying out of the
          noble and of the bad intention, of the wise as of the foolish
          maxim; which all results from the constitution of its nature, which
          is feminine, receptive, retentive, and not spontaneous; all this I
          have shown in detail in the Appendix, and illustrated by examples.
          What is said there would have been placed here, but on account of
          my polemic against Kant's pretended practical reason I have been
          obliged to relegate it to the Appendix, to which I therefore
          refer.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The ideal
          explained in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Stoical philosophy</span></em> is the most
          complete development of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">practical reason</span></em> in the true and
          genuine sense of the word; it is the highest summit to which man
          can attain by the mere use of his reason, and in it his difference
          from the brutes shows itself most distinctly. For the ethics of
          Stoicism are originally and essentially, not a doctrine of virtue,
          but merely a guide to a rational life, the end and aim of which is
          happiness through peace of mind. Virtuous conduct appears in it
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page114">[pg 114]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg114"></a> as it were merely by
          accident, as the means, not as the end. Therefore the ethical
          theory of Stoicism is in its whole nature and point of view
          fundamentally different from the ethical systems which lay stress
          directly upon virtue, such as the doctrines of the Vedas, of Plato,
          of Christianity, and of Kant. The aim of Stoical ethics is
          happiness: τελος το ευδαι μονειν (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">virtutes omnes finem habere
          beatitudinem</span></span>) it is called in the account of the Stoa
          by Stobæus (Ecl., L. ii. c. 7, p. 114, and also p. 138). Yet the
          ethics of Stoicism teach that happiness can only be attained with
          certainty through inward peace and quietness of spirit (αταραξια),
          and that this again can only be reached through virtue; this is the
          whole meaning of the saying that virtue is the highest good. But if
          indeed by degrees the end is lost sight of in the means, and virtue
          is inculcated in a way which discloses an interest entirely
          different from that of one's own happiness, for it contradicts this
          too distinctly; this is just one of those inconsistencies by means
          of which, in every system, the immediately known, or, as it is
          called, felt truth leads us back to the right way in defiance of
          syllogistic reasoning; as, for example, we see clearly in the
          ethical teaching of Spinoza, which deduces a pure doctrine of
          virtue from the egoistical <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">suum utile
          quærere</span></span> by means of palpable sophisms. According to
          this, as I conceive the spirit of the Stoical ethics, their source
          lies in the question whether the great prerogative of man, reason,
          which, by means of planned action and its results, relieves life
          and its burdens so much, might not also be capable of freeing him
          at once, directly, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, through mere knowledge,
          completely, or nearly so, of the sorrows and miseries of every kind
          of which his life is full. They held that it was not in keeping
          with the prerogative of reason that the nature given with it, which
          by means of it comprehends and contemplates an infinity of things
          and circumstances, should yet, through the present, and the
          accidents that can be contained in the few years of a life that is
          short, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page115">[pg
          115]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg115"></a>
          fleeting, and uncertain, be exposed to such intense pain, to such
          great anxiety and suffering, as arise from the tempestuous strain
          of the desires and the antipathies; and they believed that the due
          application of reason must raise men above them, and can make them
          invulnerable. Therefore Antisthenes says: Δει κτασθαι νουν, η
          βροχον (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">aut mentem parandam, aut
          laqueum.</span></span> Plut. de stoic. repugn., c. 14),
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, life is so full of
          troubles and vexations, that one must either rise above it by means
          of corrected thoughts, or leave it. It was seen that want and
          suffering did not directly and of necessity spring from not having,
          but from desiring to have and not having; that therefore this
          desire to have is the necessary condition under which alone it
          becomes a privation not to have and begets pain. Ου πενια λυπην
          εργαζεται, αλλα επιθυμια (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">non paupertas
          dolorem efficit, sed cupiditas</span></span>), Epict., fragm. 25.
          Men learned also from experience that it is only the hope of what
          is claimed that begets and nourishes the wish; therefore neither
          the many unavoidable evils which are common to all, nor
          unattainable blessings, disquiet or trouble us, but only the
          trifling more or less of those things which we can avoid or attain;
          indeed, not only what is absolutely unavoidable or unattainable,
          but also what is merely relatively so, leaves us quite undisturbed;
          therefore the ills that have once become joined to our
          individuality, or the good things that must of necessity always be
          denied us, are treated with indifference, in accordance with the
          peculiarity of human nature that every wish soon dies and can no
          more beget pain if it is not nourished by hope. It followed from
          all this that happiness always depends upon the proportion between
          our claims and what we receive. It is all one whether the
          quantities thus related be great or small, and the proportion can
          be established just as well by diminishing the amount of the first
          as by increasing the amount of the second; and in the same way it
          also follows that all suffering proceeds from the want of
          proportion <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page116">[pg
          116]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg116"></a>
          between what we demand and expect and what we get. Now this want of
          proportion obviously lies only in knowledge, and it could be
          entirely abolished through fuller insight.<a href="#note_24" id="noteref_24" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">24</span></span></a>
          Therefore Chrysippus says: δει ζῃν κατ᾽ εμπειριαν των φυσει
          συμβαινοντων (Stob. Ecl., L. ii. c. 7, p. 134), that is, one ought
          to live with a due knowledge of the transitory nature of the things
          of the world. For as often as a man loses self-command, or is
          struck down by a misfortune, or grows angry, or becomes
          faint-hearted, he shows that he finds things different from what he
          expected, consequently that he was caught in error, and did not
          know the world and life, did not know that the will of the
          individual is crossed at every step by the chance of inanimate
          nature and the antagonism of aims and the wickedness of other
          individuals: he has therefore either not made use of his reason in
          order to arrive at a general knowledge of this characteristic of
          life, or he lacks judgment, in that he does not recognise in the
          particular what he knows in general, and is therefore surprised by
          it and loses his self-command.<a href="#note_25" id="noteref_25" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">25</span></span></a> Thus
          also every keen pleasure is an error and an illusion, for no
          attained wish can give lasting satisfaction; and, moreover, every
          possession and every happiness is but lent by chance for an
          uncertain time, and may therefore be demanded back the next hour.
          All pain rests on the passing away of such an illusion; thus both
          arise from defective knowledge; the wise man therefore holds
          himself equally aloof from joy and sorrow, and no event disturbs
          his αταραξια.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In accordance
          with this spirit and aim of the Stoa, Epictetus began and ended
          with the doctrine as the kernel <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page117">[pg 117]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg117"></a> of his philosophy, that we should consider
          well and distinguish what depends upon us and what does not, and
          therefore entirely avoid counting upon the latter, whereby we shall
          certainly remain free from all pain, sorrow, and anxiety. But that
          which alone is dependent upon us is the will; and here a transition
          gradually takes place to a doctrine of virtue, for it is observed
          that as the outer world, which is independent of us, determines
          good and bad fortune, so inner contentment with ourselves, or the
          absence of it, proceeds from the will. But it was then asked
          whether we ought to apply the words <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">bonum</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">malum</span></span> to the two former or to
          the two latter? This was indeed arbitrary and a matter of choice,
          and did not make any real difference, but yet the Stoics disputed
          everlastingly with the Peripatetics and Epicureans about it, and
          amused themselves with the inadmissible comparison of two entirely
          incommensurable quantities, and the antithetical, paradoxical
          judgments which proceeded from them, and which they flung at each
          other. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Paradoxa</span></span> of Cicero afford us an
          interesting collection of these from the Stoical side.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Zeno, the
          founder, seems originally to have followed a somewhat different
          path. The starting-point with him was that for the attainment of
          the highest good, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, blessedness and spiritual
          peace, one must live in harmony with oneself (ὁμολογουμενους ξῃν;
          δ᾽ εστι καθ᾽ ἑνα λογον και συμφωνον ξῃν.—<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Consonanter vivere: hoc est secundum unam
          rationem et concordem sibi vivere.</span></span> Stob. Ecl. eth. L.
          ii., c. 7, p. 132. Also: Αρετην διαθεσιν ειναι ψυχης συμφωνον ἑαυτῃ
          περι ὁλον τον βιον. <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Virtutem esse animi
          affectiomem secum per totam vitam consentientem</span></span>,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ibid.</span></span>, p. 104.) Now this was
          only possible for a man if he determined himself entirely
          rationally, according to concepts, not according to changing
          impressions and moods; since, however, only the maxims of our
          conduct, not the consequences nor the outward circumstances, are in
          our power, in order to be always consistent we must set
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page118">[pg 118]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg118"></a> before us as our aim
          only the maxims and not the consequences and circumstances, and
          thus again a doctrine of virtue is introduced.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the ethical
          principle of Zeno—to live in harmony with oneself—appeared even to
          his immediate successors to be too formal and empty. They therefore
          gave it material content by the addition—<span class="tei tei-q">“to live in harmony with nature”</span> (ὁμολογουμενως
          τῃ φυσει ζῃν), which, as Stobæus mentions in another place, was
          first added by Kleanthes, and extended the matter very much on
          account of the wide sphere of the concept and the vagueness of the
          expression. For Kleanthes meant the whole of nature in general,
          while Chrysippus meant human nature in particular (Diog. Laert., 7,
          89). It followed that what alone was adapted to the latter was
          virtue, just as the satisfaction of animal desires was adapted to
          animal natures; and thus ethics had again to be forcibly united to
          a doctrine of virtue, and in some way or other established through
          physics. For the Stoics always aimed at unity of principle, as for
          them God and the world were not dissevered.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The ethical
          system of Stoicism, regarded as a whole, is in fact a very valuable
          and estimable attempt to use the great prerogative of man, reason,
          for an important and salutary end; to raise him above the suffering
          and pain to which all life is exposed, by means of a maxim—</p>

          him partake, in the highest degree, of the dignity which belongs to
          him as a rational being, as distinguished from the brutes; a
          dignity of which, in this sense at any rate, we can speak, though
          not in any other. It is a consequence of my view of the ethical
          system of Stoicism that it must be explained at the part of my work
          at which I consider what <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page119">[pg
          119]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg119"></a>
          reason is and what it can do. But although it may to a certain
          extent be possible to attain that end through the application of
          reason, and through a purely rational system of ethics, and
          although experience shows that the happiest men are those purely
          rational characters commonly called practical philosophers,—and
          rightly so, because just as the true, that is, the theoretical
          philosopher carries life into the concept, they carry the concept
          into life,—yet it is far from the case that perfection can be
          attained in this way, and that the reason, rightly used, can really
          free us from the burden and sorrow of life, and lead us to
          happiness. Rather, there lies an absolute contradiction in wishing
          to live without suffering, and this contradiction is also implied
          in the commonly used expression, <span class="tei tei-q">“blessed
          life.”</span> This will become perfectly clear to whoever
          comprehends the whole of the following exposition. In this purely
          rational system of ethics the contradiction reveals itself thus,
          the Stoic is obliged in his doctrine of the way to the blessed life
          (for that is what his ethical system always remains) to insert a
          recommendation of suicide (as among the magnificent ornaments and
          apparel of Eastern despots there is always a costly vial of poison)
          for the case in which the sufferings of the body, which cannot be
          philosophised away by any principles or syllogistic reasonings, are
          paramount and incurable; thus its one aim, blessedness, is rendered
          vain, and nothing remains as a mode of escape from suffering except
          death; in such a case then death must be voluntarily accepted, just
          as we would take any other medicine. Here then a marked antagonism
          is brought out between the ethical system of Stoicism and all those
          systems referred to above which make virtue in itself directly, and
          accompanied by the most grievous sorrows, their aim, and will not
          allow a man to end his life in order to escape from suffering. Not
          one of them, however, was able to give the true reason for the
          rejection of suicide, but they laboriously collected illusory
          explanations from all sides: the true <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page120">[pg 120]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg120"></a> reason will appear in the Fourth Book in the
          course of the development of our system. But the antagonism
          referred to reveals and establishes the essential difference in
          fundamental principle between Stoicism, which is just a special
          form of endæmonism, and those doctrines we have mentioned, although
          both are often at one in their results, and are apparently related.
          And the inner contradiction referred to above, with which the
          ethical system of Stoicism is affected even in its fundamental
          thought, shows itself further in the circumstance that its ideal,
          the Stoic philosopher, as the system itself represents him, could
          never obtain life or inner poetic truth, but remains a wooden,
          stiff lay-figure of which nothing can be made. He cannot himself
          make use of his wisdom, and his perfect peace, contentment, and
          blessedness directly contradict the nature of man, and preclude us
          from forming any concrete idea of him. When compared with him, how
          entirely different appear the overcomers of the world, and
          voluntary hermits that Indian philosophy presents to us, and has
          actually produced; or indeed, the holy man of Christianity, that
          excellent form full of deep life, of the greatest poetic truth, and
          the highest significance, which stands before us in perfect virtue,
          holiness, and sublimity, yet in a state of supreme suffering.<a href="#note_26" id="noteref_26" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">26</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 17. In the
          first book we considered the idea merely as such, that is, only
          according to its general form. It is true that as far as the
          abstract idea, the concept, is concerned, we obtained a knowledge
          of it in respect of its content also, because it has content and
          meaning only in relation to the idea of perception, without which
          it would be worthless and empty. Accordingly, directing our
          attention exclusively to the idea of perception, we shall now
          endeavour to arrive at a knowledge of its content, its more exact
          definition, and the forms which it presents to us. And it will
          specially interest us to find an explanation of its peculiar
          significance, that significance which is otherwise merely felt, but
          on account of which it is that these pictures do not pass by us
          entirely strange and meaningless, as they must otherwise do, but
          speak to us directly, are understood, and obtain an interest which
          concerns our whole nature.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We direct our
          attention to mathematics, natural science, and philosophy, for each
          of these holds out the hope that it will afford us a part of the
          explanation we desire. Now, taking philosophy first, we find that
          it is like a monster with many heads, each of which speaks a
          different language. They are not, indeed, all at variance on the
          point we are here considering, the significance of the idea of
          perception. For, with the exception of the Sceptics and the
          Idealists, the others, for the most part, speak very much in the
          same way of an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">object</span></em> which constitutes the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">basis</span></em> of the idea, and which is
          indeed different in its whole being and nature from the idea, but
          yet is in all <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page124">[pg
          124]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg124"></a>
          points as like it as one egg is to another. But this does not help
          us, for we are quite unable to distinguish such an object from the
          idea; we find that they are one and the same; for every object
          always and for ever presupposes a subject, and therefore remains
          idea, so that we recognised objectivity as belonging to the most
          universal form of the idea, which is the division into subject and
          object. Further, the principle of sufficient reason, which is
          referred to in support of this doctrine, is for us merely the form
          of the idea, the orderly combination of one idea with another, but
          not the combination of the whole finite or infinite series of ideas
          with something which is not idea at all, and which cannot therefore
          be presented in perception. Of the Sceptics and Idealists we spoke
          above, in examining the controversy about the reality of the outer
          world.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If we turn to
          mathematics to look for the fuller knowledge we desire of the idea
          of perception, which we have, as yet, only understood generally,
          merely in its form, we find that mathematics only treats of these
          ideas so far as they fill time and space, that is, so far as they
          are quantities. It will tell us with the greatest accuracy the
          how-many and the how-much; but as this is always merely relative,
          that is to say, merely a comparison of one idea with others, and a
          comparison only in the one respect of quantity, this also is not
          the information we are principally in search of.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lastly, if we
          turn to the wide province of natural science, which is divided into
          many fields, we may, in the first place, make a general division of
          it into two parts. It is either the description of forms, which I
          call <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Morphology</span></em>, or the explanation of
          changes, which I call <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Etiology</span></em>. The first treats of the
          permanent forms, the second of the changing matter, according to
          the laws of its transition from one form to another. The first is
          the whole extent of what is generally called natural history. It
          teaches us, especially in the sciences of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page125">[pg 125]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg125"></a> botany and zoology, the various permanent,
          organised, and therefore definitely determined forms in the
          constant change of individuals; and these forms constitute a great
          part of the content of the idea of perception. In natural history
          they are classified, separated, united, arranged according to
          natural and artificial systems, and brought under concepts which
          make a general view and knowledge of the whole of them possible.
          Further, an infinitely fine analogy both in the whole and in the
          parts of these forms, and running through them all (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">unité de plan</span></span>), is established,
          and thus they may be compared to innumerable variations on a theme
          which is not given. The passage of matter into these forms, that is
          to say, the origin of individuals, is not a special part of natural
          science, for every individual springs from its like by generation,
          which is everywhere equally mysterious, and has as yet evaded
          definite knowledge. The little that is known on the subject finds
          its place in physiology, which belongs to that part of natural
          science I have called etiology. Mineralogy also, especially where
          it becomes geology, inclines towards etiology, though it
          principally belongs to morphology. Etiology proper comprehends all
          those branches of natural science in which the chief concern is the
          knowledge of cause and effect. The sciences teach how, according to
          an invariable rule, one condition of matter is necessarily followed
          by a certain other condition; how one change necessarily conditions
          and brings about a certain other change; this sort of teaching is
          called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">explanation</span></em>. The principal
          sciences in this department are mechanics, physics, chemistry, and
          physiology.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If, however, we
          surrender ourselves to its teaching, we soon become convinced that
          etiology cannot afford us the information we chiefly desire, any
          more than morphology. The latter presents to us innumerable and
          infinitely varied forms, which are yet related by an unmistakable
          family likeness. These are for us ideas, and when only treated in
          this way, they remain always strange to us, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page126">[pg 126]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg126"></a> and stand before us like hieroglyphics
          which we do not understand. Etiology, on the other hand, teaches us
          that, according to the law of cause and effect, this particular
          condition of matter brings about that other particular condition,
          and thus it has explained it and performed its part. However, it
          really does nothing more than indicate the orderly arrangement
          according to which the states of matter appear in space and time,
          and teach in all cases what phenomenon must necessarily appear at a
          particular time in a particular place. It thus determines the
          position of phenomena in time and space, according to a law whose
          special content is derived from experience, but whose universal
          form and necessity is yet known to us independently of experience.
          But it affords us absolutely no information about the inner nature
          of any one of these phenomena: this is called a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">force of
          nature</span></em>, and it lies outside the province of causal
          explanation, which calls the constant uniformity with which
          manifestations of such a force appear whenever their known
          conditions are present, a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">law of nature</span></em>. But this law of
          nature, these conditions, and this appearance in a particular place
          at a particular time, are all that it knows or ever can know. The
          force itself which manifests itself, the inner nature of the
          phenomena which appear in accordance with these laws, remains
          always a secret to it, something entirely strange and unknown in
          the case of the simplest as well as of the most complex phenomena.
          For although as yet etiology has most completely achieved its aim
          in mechanics, and least completely in physiology, still the force
          on account of which a stone falls to the ground or one body repels
          another is, in its inner nature, not less strange and mysterious
          than that which produces the movements and the growth of an animal.
          The science of mechanics presupposes matter, weight,
          impenetrability, the possibility of communicating motion by impact,
          inertia and so forth as ultimate facts, calls them forces of
          nature, and their necessary and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page127">[pg 127]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg127"></a> orderly appearance under certain conditions a
          law of nature. Only after this does its explanation begin, and it
          consists in indicating truly and with mathematical exactness, how,
          where and when each force manifests itself, and in referring every
          phenomenon which presents itself to the operation of one of these
          forces. Physics, chemistry, and physiology proceed in the same way
          in their province, only they presuppose more and accomplish less.
          Consequently the most complete etiological explanation of the whole
          of nature can never be more than an enumeration of forces which
          cannot be explained, and a reliable statement of the rule according
          to which phenomena appear in time and space, succeed, and make way
          for each other. But the inner nature of the forces which thus
          appear remains unexplained by such an explanation, which must
          confine itself to phenomena and their arrangement, because the law
          which it follows does not extend further. In this respect it may be
          compared to a section of a piece of marble which shows many veins
          beside each other, but does not allow us to trace the course of the
          veins from the interior of the marble to its surface. Or, if I may
          use an absurd but more striking comparison, the philosophical
          investigator must always have the same feeling towards the complete
          etiology of the whole of nature, as a man who, without knowing how,
          has been brought into a company quite unknown to him, each member
          of which in turn presents another to him as his friend and cousin,
          and therefore as quite well known, and yet the man himself, while
          at each introduction he expresses himself gratified, has always the
          question on his lips: <span class="tei tei-q">“But how the deuce do
          I stand to the whole company?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus we see
          that, with regard to those phenomena which we know only as our
          ideas, etiology can never give us the desired information that
          shall carry us beyond this point. For, after all its explanations,
          they still remain quite strange to us, as mere ideas whose
          significance <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page128">[pg
          128]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg128"></a>
          we do not understand. The causal connection merely gives us the
          rule and the relative order of their appearance in space and time,
          but affords us no further knowledge of that which so appears.
          Moreover, the law of causality itself has only validity for ideas,
          for objects of a definite class, and it has meaning only in so far
          as it presupposes them. Thus, like these objects themselves, it
          always exists only in relation to a subject, that is,
          conditionally; and so it is known just as well if we start from the
          subject, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          priori</span></span>, as if we start from the object, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a posteriori</span></span>. Kant indeed has
          taught us this.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But what now
          impels us to inquiry is just that we are not satisfied with knowing
          that we have ideas, that they are such and such, and that they are
          connected according to certain laws, the general expression of
          which is the principle of sufficient reason. We wish to know the
          significance of these ideas; we ask whether this world is merely
          idea; in which case it would pass by us like an empty dream or a
          baseless vision, not worth our notice; or whether it is also
          something else, something more than idea, and if so, what. Thus
          much is certain, that this something we seek for must be completely
          and in its whole nature different from the idea; that the forms and
          laws of the idea must therefore be completely foreign to it;
          further, that we cannot arrive at it from the idea under the
          guidance of the laws which merely combine objects, ideas, among
          themselves, and which are the forms of the principle of sufficient
          reason.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus we see
          already that we can never arrive at the real nature of things from
          without. However much we investigate, we can never reach anything
          but images and names. We are like a man who goes round a castle
          seeking in vain for an entrance, and sometimes sketching the
          façades. And yet this is the method that has been followed by all
          philosophers before me.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 18. In fact,
          the meaning for which we seek of that <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page129">[pg 129]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg129"></a> world which is present to us only as our
          idea, or the transition from the world as mere idea of the knowing
          subject to whatever it may be besides this, would never be found if
          the investigator himself were nothing more than the pure knowing
          subject (a winged cherub without a body). But he is himself rooted
          in that world; he finds himself in it as an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">individual</span></em>, that is to say, his
          knowledge, which is the necessary supporter of the whole world as
          idea, is yet always given through the medium of a body, whose
          affections are, as we have shown, the starting-point for the
          understanding in the perception of that world. His body is, for the
          pure knowing subject, an idea like every other idea, an object
          among objects. Its movements and actions are so far known to him in
          precisely the same way as the changes of all other perceived
          objects, and would be just as strange and incomprehensible to him
          if their meaning were not explained for him in an entirely
          different way. Otherwise he would see his actions follow upon given
          motives with the constancy of a law of nature, just as the changes
          of other objects follow upon causes, stimuli, or motives. But he
          would not understand the influence of the motives any more than the
          connection between every other effect which he sees and its cause.
          He would then call the inner nature of these manifestations and
          actions of his body which he did not understand a force, a quality,
          or a character, as he pleased, but he would have no further insight
          into it. But all this is not the case; indeed the answer to the
          riddle is given to the subject of knowledge who appears as an
          individual, and the answer is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em>. This and this alone gives
          him the key to his own existence, reveals to him the significance,
          shows him the inner mechanism of his being, of his action, of his
          movements. The body is given in two entirely different ways to the
          subject of knowledge, who becomes an individual only through his
          identity with it. It is given as an idea in intelligent perception,
          as an object among objects and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page130">[pg 130]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg130"></a> subject to the laws of objects. And it is
          also given in quite a different way as that which is immediately
          known to every one, and is signified by the word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em>.
          Every true act of his will is also at once and without exception a
          movement of his body. The act of will and the movement of the body
          are not two different things objectively known, which the bond of
          causality unites; they do not stand in the relation of cause and
          effect; they are one and the same, but they are given in entirely
          different ways,—immediately, and again in perception for the
          understanding. The action of the body is nothing but the act of the
          will objectified, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, passed into perception. It
          will appear later that this is true of every movement of the body,
          not merely those which follow upon motives, but also involuntary
          movements which follow upon mere stimuli, and, indeed, that the
          whole body is nothing but objectified will, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          will become idea. All this will be proved and made quite clear in
          the course of this work. In one respect, therefore, I shall call
          the body the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">objectivity of will</span></em>; as in the
          previous book, and in the essay on the principle of sufficient
          reason, in accordance with the one-sided point of view
          intentionally adopted there (that of the idea), I called it
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the
          immediate object</span></em>. Thus in a certain sense we may also
          say that will is the knowledge <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          priori</span></span> of the body, and the body is the knowledge
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a posteriori</span></span> of the will.
          Resolutions of the will which relate to the future are merely
          deliberations of the reason about what we shall will at a
          particular time, not real acts of will. Only the carrying out of
          the resolve stamps it as will, for till then it is never more than
          an intention that may be changed, and that exists only in the
          reason <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">in abstracto</span></span>.
          It is only in reflection that to will and to act are different; in
          reality they are one. Every true, genuine, immediate act of will is
          also, at once and immediately, a visible act of the body. And,
          corresponding to this, every impression upon the body is also, on
          the other hand, at once <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page131">[pg
          131]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg131"></a>
          and immediately an impression upon the will. As such it is called
          pain when it is opposed to the will; gratification or pleasure when
          it is in accordance with it. The degrees of both are widely
          different. It is quite wrong, however, to call pain and pleasure
          ideas, for they are by no means ideas, but immediate affections of
          the will in its manifestation, the body; compulsory, instantaneous
          willing or not-willing of the impression which the body sustains.
          There are only a few impressions of the body which do not touch the
          will, and it is through these alone that the body is an immediate
          object of knowledge, for, as perceived by the understanding, it is
          already an indirect object like all others. These impressions are,
          therefore, to be treated directly as mere ideas, and excepted from
          what has been said. The impressions we refer to are the affections
          of the purely objective senses of sight, hearing, and touch, though
          only so far as these organs are affected in the way which is
          specially peculiar to their specific nature. This affection of them
          is so excessively weak an excitement of the heightened and
          specifically modified sensibility of these parts that it does not
          affect the will, but only furnishes the understanding with the data
          out of which the perception arises, undisturbed by any excitement
          of the will. But every stronger or different kind of affection of
          these organs of sense is painful, that is to say, against the will,
          and thus they also belong to its objectivity. Weakness of the
          nerves shows itself in this, that the impressions which have only
          such a degree of strength as would usually be sufficient to make
          them data for the understanding reach the higher degree at which
          they influence the will, that is to say, give pain or pleasure,
          though more often pain, which is, however, to some extent deadened
          and inarticulate, so that not only particular tones and strong
          light are painful to us, but there ensues a generally unhealthy and
          hypochondriacal disposition which is not distinctly understood. The
          identity of the body and the will shows itself further,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page132">[pg 132]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg132"></a> among other ways, in
          the circumstance that every vehement and excessive movement of the
          will, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, every emotion, agitates
          the body and its inner constitution directly, and disturbs the
          course of its vital functions. This is shown in detail in
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Will in Nature,”</span> p. 27 of the
          second edition and p. 28 of the third.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lastly, the
          knowledge which I have of my will, though it is immediate, cannot
          be separated from that which I have of my body. I know my will, not
          as a whole, not as a unity, not completely, according to its
          nature, but I know it only in its particular acts, and therefore in
          time, which is the form of the phenomenal aspect of my body, as of
          every object. Therefore the body is a condition of the knowledge of
          my will. Thus, I cannot really imagine this will apart from my
          body. In the essay on the principle of sufficient reason, the will,
          or rather the subject of willing, is treated as a special class of
          ideas or objects. But even there we saw this object become one with
          the subject; that is, we saw it cease to be an object. We there
          called this union the miracle κατ᾽ εξοχην, and the whole of the
          present work is to a certain extent an explanation of this. So far
          as I know my will specially as object, I know it as body. But then
          I am again at the first class of ideas laid down in that essay,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, real objects. As we
          proceed we shall see always more clearly that these ideas of the
          first class obtain their explanation and solution from those of the
          fourth class given in the essay, which could no longer be properly
          opposed to the subject as object, and that, therefore, we must
          learn to understand the inner nature of the law of causality which
          is valid in the first class, and of all that happens in accordance
          with it from the law of motivation which governs the fourth
          class.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The identity of
          the will and the body, of which we have now given a cursory
          explanation, can only be proved in the manner we have adopted here.
          We have proved this identity for the first time, and shall do so
          more and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page133">[pg
          133]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg133"></a>
          more fully in the course of this work. By <span class="tei tei-q">“proved”</span> we mean raised from the immediate
          consciousness, from knowledge in the concrete to abstract knowledge
          of the reason, or carried over into abstract knowledge. On the
          other hand, from its very nature it can never be demonstrated, that
          is, deduced as indirect knowledge from some other more direct
          knowledge, just because it is itself the most direct knowledge; and
          if we do not apprehend it and stick to it as such, we shall expect
          in vain to receive it again in some indirect way as derivative
          knowledge. It is knowledge of quite a special kind, whose truth
          cannot therefore properly be brought under any of the four rubrics
          under which I have classified all truth in the essay on the
          principle of sufficient reason, § 29, the logical, the empirical,
          the metaphysical, and the metalogical, for it is not, like all
          these, the relation of an abstract idea to another idea, or to the
          necessary form of perceptive or of abstract ideation, but it is the
          relation of a judgment to the connection which an idea of
          perception, the body, has to that which is not an idea at all, but
          something <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">toto genere</span></span>
          different, will. I should like therefore to distinguish this from
          all other truth, and call it κατ᾽ εξοχην <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">philosophical
          truth</span></em>. We can turn the expression of this truth in
          different ways and say: My body and my will are one;—or, What as an
          idea of perception I call my body, I call my will, so far as I am
          conscious of it in an entirely different way which cannot be
          compared to any other;—or, My body is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">objectivity</span></em> of my will;—or, My
          body considered apart from the fact that it is my idea is still my
          will, and so forth.<a href="#note_27" id="noteref_27" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">27</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 19. In the
          first book we were reluctantly driven to explain the human body as
          merely idea of the subject which knows it, like all the other
          objects of this world of perception. But it has now become clear
          that what enables us consciously to distinguish our own body from
          all other objects which in other respects are precisely the
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page134">[pg 134]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg134"></a> same, is that our
          body appears in consciousness in quite another way <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">toto genere</span></span> different from idea,
          and this we denote by the word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em>;
          and that it is just this double knowledge which we have of our own
          body that affords us information about it, about its action and
          movement following on motives, and also about what it experiences
          by means of external impressions; in a word, about what it is, not
          as idea, but as more than idea; that is to say, what it is
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in
          itself</span></em>. None of this information have we got directly
          with regard to the nature, action, and experience of other real
          objects.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is just
          because of this special relation to one body that the knowing
          subject is an individual. For regarded apart from this relation,
          his body is for him only an idea like all other ideas. But the
          relation through which the knowing subject is an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">individual</span></em>, is just on that
          account a relation which subsists only between him and one
          particular idea of all those which he has. Therefore he is
          conscious of this <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> idea, not merely as an idea,
          but in quite a different way as a will. If, however, he abstracts
          from that special relation, from that twofold and completely
          heterogeneous knowledge of what is one and the same, then that
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em>, the body, is an idea like all
          other ideas. Therefore, in order to understand the matter, the
          individual who knows must either assume that what distinguishes
          that one idea from others is merely the fact that his knowledge
          stands in this double relation to it alone; that insight in two
          ways at the same time is open to him only in the case of this one
          object of perception, and that this is to be explained not by the
          difference of this object from all others, but only by the
          difference between the relation of his knowledge to this one
          object, and its relation to all other objects. Or else he must
          assume that this object is essentially different from all others;
          that it alone of all objects is at once both will and idea, while
          the rest are only ideas, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, only phantoms. Thus he
          must assume that his body is the only real individual in
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page135">[pg 135]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg135"></a> the world,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the only phenomenon of
          will and the only immediate object of the subject. That other
          objects, considered merely as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ideas</span></em>, are like his body, that is,
          like it, fill space (which itself can only be present as idea), and
          also, like it, are causally active in space, is indeed demonstrably
          certain from the law of causality which is <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          priori</span></span> valid for ideas, and which admits of no effect
          without a cause; but apart from the fact that we can only reason
          from an effect to a cause generally, and not to a similar cause, we
          are still in the sphere of mere ideas, in which alone the law of
          causality is valid, and beyond which it can never take us. But
          whether the objects known to the individual only as ideas are yet,
          like his own body, manifestations of a will, is, as was said in the
          First Book, the proper meaning of the question as to the reality of
          the external world. To deny this is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">theoretical
          egoism</span></em>, which on that account regards all phenomena
          that are outside its own will as phantoms, just as in a practical
          reference exactly the same thing is done by practical egoism. For
          in it a man regards and treats himself alone as a person, and all
          other persons as mere phantoms. Theoretical egoism can never be
          demonstrably refuted, yet in philosophy it has never been used
          otherwise than as a sceptical sophism, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, a
          pretence. As a serious conviction, on the other hand, it could only
          be found in a madhouse, and as such it stands in need of a cure
          rather than a refutation. We do not therefore combat it any further
          in this regard, but treat it as merely the last stronghold of
          scepticism, which is always polemical. Thus our knowledge, which is
          always bound to individuality and is limited by this circumstance,
          brings with it the necessity that each of us can only <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">be one</span></em>,
          while, on the other hand, each of us can <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">know
          all</span></em>; and it is this limitation that creates the need
          for philosophy. We therefore who, for this very reason, are
          striving to extend the limits of our knowledge through philosophy,
          will treat this sceptical argument of theoretical egoism
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page136">[pg 136]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg136"></a> which meets us, as
          an army would treat a small frontier fortress. The fortress cannot
          indeed be taken, but the garrison can never sally forth from it,
          and therefore we pass it by without danger, and are not afraid to
          have it in our rear.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The double
          knowledge which each of us has of the nature and activity of his
          own body, and which is given in two completely different ways, has
          now been clearly brought out. We shall accordingly make further use
          of it as a key to the nature of every phenomenon in nature, and
          shall judge of all objects which are not our own bodies, and are
          consequently not given to our consciousness in a double way but
          only as ideas, according to the analogy of our own bodies, and
          shall therefore assume that as in one aspect they are idea, just
          like our bodies, and in this respect are analogous to them, so in
          another aspect, what remains of objects when we set aside their
          existence as idea of the subject, must in its inner nature be the
          same as that in us which we call <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em>.
          For what other kind of existence or reality should we attribute to
          the rest of the material world? Whence should we take the elements
          out of which we construct such a world? Besides will and idea
          nothing is known to us or thinkable. If we wish to attribute the
          greatest known reality to the material world which exists
          immediately only in our idea, we give it the reality which our own
          body has for each of us; for that is the most real thing for every
          one. But if we now analyse the reality of this body and its
          actions, beyond the fact that it is idea, we find nothing in it
          except the will; with this its reality is exhausted. Therefore we
          can nowhere find another kind of reality which we can attribute to
          the material world. Thus if we hold that the material world is
          something more than merely our idea, we must say that besides being
          idea, that is, in itself and according to its inmost nature, it is
          that which we find immediately in ourselves as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em>. I
          say according to its inmost nature; but we must first come
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page137">[pg 137]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg137"></a> to know more
          accurately this real nature of the will, in order that we may be
          able to distinguish from it what does not belong to itself, but to
          its manifestation, which has many grades. Such, for example, is the
          circumstance of its being accompanied by knowledge, and the
          determination by motives which is conditioned by this knowledge. As
          we shall see farther on, this does not belong to the real nature of
          will, but merely to its distinct manifestation as an animal or a
          human being. If, therefore, I say,—the force which attracts a stone
          to the earth is according to its nature, in itself, and apart from
          all idea, will, I shall not be supposed to express in this
          proposition the insane opinion that the stone moves itself in
          accordance with a known motive, merely because this is the way in
          which will appears in man.<a href="#note_28" id="noteref_28" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">28</span></span></a> We
          shall now proceed more clearly and in detail to prove, establish,
          and develop to its full extent what as yet has only been
          provisionally and generally explained.<a href="#note_29" id="noteref_29" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">29</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 20. As we have
          said, the will proclaims itself primarily in the voluntary
          movements of our own body, as the inmost nature of this body, as
          that which it is besides being object of perception, idea. For
          these voluntary movements are nothing else than the visible aspect
          of the individual acts of will, with which they are directly
          coincident and identical, and only distinguished through the form
          of knowledge into which they have passed, and in which alone they
          can be known, the form of idea.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But these acts
          of will have always a ground or reason outside themselves in
          motives. Yet these motives never determine more than what I will at
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em> time, in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page138">[pg 138]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg138"></a> place, and under
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">these</span></em> circumstances, not
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em> I will in general, or
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">what</span></em> I will in general, that is,
          the maxims which characterise my volition generally. Therefore the
          inner nature of my volition cannot be explained from these motives;
          but they merely determine its manifestation at a given point of
          time: they are merely the occasion of my will showing itself; but
          the will itself lies outside the province of the law of motivation,
          which determines nothing but its appearance at each point of time.
          It is only under the presupposition of my empirical character that
          the motive is a sufficient ground of explanation of my action. But
          if I abstract from my character, and then ask, why, in general, I
          will this and not that, no answer is possible, because it is only
          the manifestation of the will that is subject to the principle of
          sufficient reason, and not the will itself, which in this respect
          is to be called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">groundless</span></em>. At this point I
          presuppose Kant's doctrine of the empirical and intelligible
          character, and also my own treatment of the subject in <span class="tei tei-q">“The Fundamental Problems of Ethics,”</span> pp. 48,
          58, and 178, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">et seq.</span></span>, of first edition (p.
          174, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">et
          seq.</span></span>, of second edition). I shall also have to speak
          more fully on the question in the Fourth Book. For the present, I
          have only to draw attention to this, that the fact of one
          manifestation being established through another, as here the deed
          through the motive, does not at all conflict with the fact that its
          real nature is will, which itself has no <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ground</span></em>;
          for as the principle of sufficient reason in all its aspects is
          only the form of knowledge, its validity extends only to the idea,
          to the phenomena, to the visibility of the will, but not to the
          will itself, which becomes visible.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If now every
          action of my body is the manifestation of an act of will in which
          my will itself in general, and as a whole, thus my character,
          expresses itself under given motives, manifestation of the will
          must be the inevitable condition and presupposition of every
          action. For the fact of its manifestation cannot depend upon
          something <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page139">[pg
          139]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg139"></a>
          which does not exist directly and only through it, which
          consequently is for it merely accidental, and through which its
          manifestation itself would be merely accidental. Now that condition
          is just the whole body itself. Thus the body itself must be
          manifestation of the will, and it must be related to my will as a
          whole, that is, to my intelligible character, whose phenomenal
          appearance in time is my empirical character, as the particular
          action of the body is related to the particular act of the will.
          The whole body, then, must be simply my will become visible, must
          be my will itself, so far as this is object of perception, an idea
          of the first class. It has already been advanced in confirmation of
          this that every impression upon my body also affects my will at
          once and immediately, and in this respect is called pain or
          pleasure, or, in its lower degrees, agreeable or disagreeable
          sensation; and also, conversely, that every violent movement of the
          will, every emotion or passion, convulses the body and disturbs the
          course of its functions. Indeed we can also give an etiological
          account, though a very incomplete one, of the origin of my body,
          and a somewhat better account of its development and conservation,
          and this is the substance of physiology. But physiology merely
          explains its theme in precisely the same way as motives explain
          action. Thus the physiological explanation of the functions of the
          body detracts just as little from the philosophical truth that the
          whole existence of this body and the sum total of its functions are
          merely the objectification of that will which appears in its
          outward actions in accordance with a motive, as the establishment
          of the individual action through the motive and the necessary
          sequence of the action from the motive conflicts with the fact that
          action in general, and according to its nature, is only the
          manifestation of a will which itself has no ground. If, however,
          physiology tries to refer even these outward actions, the immediate
          voluntary movements, to causes in the organism,—for example, if it
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page140">[pg 140]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg140"></a> explains the
          movement of the muscles as resulting from the presence of fluids
          (<span class="tei tei-q">“like the contraction of a cord when it is
          wet,”</span> says Reil in his <span class="tei tei-q">“Archiv für
          Physiologie,”</span> vol. vi. p. 153), even supposing it really
          could give a thorough explanation of this kind, yet this would
          never invalidate the immediately certain truth that every voluntary
          motion (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">functiones
          animales</span></span>) is the manifestation of an act of will.
          Now, just as little can the physiological explanation of vegetative
          life (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">functiones naturales
          vitales</span></span>), however far it may advance, ever invalidate
          the truth that the whole animal life which thus develops itself is
          the manifestation of will. In general, then, as we have shown
          above, no etiological explanation can ever give us more than the
          necessarily determined position in time and space of a particular
          manifestation, its necessary appearance there, according to a fixed
          law; but the inner nature of everything that appears in this way
          remains wholly inexplicable, and is presupposed by every
          etiological explanation, and merely indicated by the names, force,
          or law of nature, or, if we are speaking of action, character or
          will. Thus, although every particular action, under the
          presupposition of the definite character, necessarily follows from
          the given motive, and although growth, the process of nourishment,
          and all the changes of the animal body take place according to
          necessarily acting causes (stimuli), yet the whole series of
          actions, and consequently every individual act, and also its
          condition, the whole body itself which accomplishes it, and
          therefore also the process through which and in which it exists,
          are nothing but the manifestation of the will, the becoming
          visible, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the objectification of the will</span></em>.
          Upon this rests the perfect suitableness of the human and animal
          body to the human and animal will in general, resembling, though
          far surpassing, the correspondence between an instrument made for a
          purpose and the will of the maker, and on this account appearing as
          design, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the teleological
          explanation of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page141">[pg
          141]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg141"></a>
          the body. The parts of the body must, therefore, completely
          correspond to the principal desires through which the will
          manifests itself; they must be the visible expression of these
          desires. Teeth, throat, and bowels are objectified hunger; the
          organs of generation are objectified sexual desire; the grasping
          hand, the hurrying feet, correspond to the more indirect desires of
          the will which they express. As the human form generally
          corresponds to the human will generally, so the individual bodily
          structure corresponds to the individually modified will, the
          character of the individual, and therefore it is throughout and in
          all its parts characteristic and full of expression. It is very
          remarkable that Parmenides already gave expression to this in the
          following verses, quoted by Aristotle (Metaph. iii. 5):—</p>

          as feeling, a knowledge that his will is the real inner nature of
          his phenomenal being, which manifests itself to him as idea, both
          in his actions and in their permanent substratum, his body, and
          that his will is that which is most immediate in his consciousness,
          though it has not as such completely passed into the form of idea
          in which object and subject stand over against each other, but
          makes <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page142">[pg 142]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg142"></a> itself known to him
          in a direct manner, in which he does not quite clearly distinguish
          subject and object, yet is not known as a whole to the individual
          himself, but only in its particular acts,—whoever, I say, has with
          me gained this conviction will find that of itself it affords him
          the key to the knowledge of the inmost being of the whole of
          nature; for he now transfers it to all those phenomena which are
          not given to him, like his own phenomenal existence, both in direct
          and indirect knowledge, but only in the latter, thus merely
          one-sidedly as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">idea</span></em> alone. He will recognise this
          will of which we are speaking not only in those phenomenal
          existences which exactly resemble his own, in men and animals as
          their inmost nature, but the course of reflection will lead him to
          recognise the force which germinates and vegetates in the plant,
          and indeed the force through which the crystal is formed, that by
          which the magnet turns to the north pole, the force whose shock he
          experiences from the contact of two different kinds of metals, the
          force which appears in the elective affinities of matter as
          repulsion and attraction, decomposition and combination, and,
          lastly, even gravitation, which acts so powerfully throughout
          matter, draws the stone to the earth and the earth to the sun,—all
          these, I say, he will recognise as different only in their
          phenomenal existence, but in their inner nature as identical, as
          that which is directly known to him so intimately and so much
          better than anything else, and which in its most distinct
          manifestation is called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em>. It is this application of
          reflection alone that prevents us from remaining any longer at the
          phenomenon, and leads us to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thing in
          itself</span></em>. Phenomenal existence is idea and nothing more.
          All idea, of whatever kind it may be, all <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">object</span></em>,
          is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">phenomenal</span></em> existence, but the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em> alone is a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thing in
          itself</span></em>. As such, it is throughout not idea, but
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">toto genere</span></span> different from it;
          it is that of which all idea, all object, is the phenomenal
          appearance, the visibility, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page143">[pg 143]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg143"></a> the objectification. It is the inmost nature,
          the kernel, of every particular thing, and also of the whole. It
          appears in every blind force of nature and also in the
          preconsidered action of man; and the great difference between these
          two is merely in the degree of the manifestation, not in the nature
          of what manifests itself.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 22. Now, if we
          are to think as an object this thing-in-itself (we wish to retain
          the Kantian expression as a standing formula), which, as such, is
          never object, because all object is its mere manifestation, and
          therefore cannot be it itself, we must borrow for it the name and
          concept of an object, of something in some way objectively given,
          consequently of one of its own manifestations. But in order to
          serve as a clue for the understanding, this can be no other than
          the most complete of all its manifestations, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          the most distinct, the most developed, and directly enlightened by
          knowledge. Now this is the human will. It is, however, well to
          observe that here, at any rate, we only make use of a <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">denominatio a potiori</span></span>, through
          which, therefore, the concept of will receives a greater extension
          than it has hitherto had. Knowledge of the identical in different
          phenomena, and of difference in similar phenomena, is, as Plato so
          often remarks, a <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">sine qua non</span></span> of
          philosophy. But hitherto it was not recognised that every kind of
          active and operating force in nature is essentially identical with
          will, and therefore the multifarious kinds of phenomena were not
          seen to be merely different species of the same genus, but were
          treated as heterogeneous. Consequently there could be no word to
          denote the concept of this genus. I therefore name the genus after
          its most important species, the direct knowledge of which lies
          nearer to us and guides us to the indirect knowledge of all other
          species. But whoever is incapable of carrying out the required
          extension of the concept will remain involved in a permanent
          misunderstanding. For by the word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em> he
          understands only that species of it which has hitherto been
          exclusively <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page144">[pg
          144]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg144"></a>
          denoted by it, the will which is guided by knowledge, and whose
          manifestation follows only upon motives, and indeed merely abstract
          motives, and thus takes place under the guidance of the reason.
          This, we have said, is only the most prominent example of the
          manifestation of will. We must now distinctly separate in thought
          the inmost essence of this manifestation which is known to us
          directly, and then transfer it to all the weaker, less distinct
          manifestations of the same nature, and thus we shall accomplish the
          desired extension of the concept of will. From another point of
          view I should be equally misunderstood by any one who should think
          that it is all the same in the end whether we denote this inner
          nature of all phenomena by the word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em> or
          by any other. This would be the case if the thing-in-itself were
          something whose existence we merely <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">inferred</span></em>, and thus knew indirectly
          and only in the abstract. Then, indeed, we might call it what we
          pleased; the name would stand merely as the symbol of an unknown
          quantity. But the word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em>, which, like a magic spell,
          discloses to us the inmost being of everything in nature, is by no
          means an unknown quantity, something arrived at only by inference,
          but is fully and immediately comprehended, and is so familiar to us
          that we know and understand what will is far better than anything
          else whatever. The concept of will has hitherto commonly been
          subordinated to that of force, but I reverse the matter entirely,
          and desire that every force in nature should be thought as will. It
          must not be supposed that this is mere verbal quibbling or of no
          consequence; rather, it is of the greatest significance and
          importance. For at the foundation of the concept of force, as of
          all other concepts, there ultimately lies the knowledge in
          sense-perception of the objective world, that is to say, the
          phenomenon, the idea; and the concept is constructed out of this.
          It is an abstraction from the province in which cause and effect
          reign, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, from ideas of perception,
          and means just the causal nature of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page145">[pg 145]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg145"></a> causes at the point at which this causal
          nature is no further etiologically explicable, but is the necessary
          presupposition of all etiological explanation. The concept will, on
          the other hand, is of all possible concepts the only one which has
          its source <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> in the phenomenal, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> in
          the mere idea of perception, but comes from within, and proceeds
          from the most immediate consciousness of each of us, in which each
          of us knows his own individuality, according to its nature,
          immediately, apart from all form, even that of subject and object,
          and which at the same time is this individuality, for here the
          subject and the object of knowledge are one. If, therefore, we
          refer the concept of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">force</span></em> to that of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em>,
          we have in fact referred the less known to what is infinitely
          better known; indeed, to the one thing that is really immediately
          and fully known to us, and have very greatly extended our
          knowledge. If, on the contrary, we subsume the concept of will
          under that of force, as has hitherto always been done, we renounce
          the only immediate knowledge which we have of the inner nature of
          the world, for we allow it to disappear in a concept which is
          abstracted from the phenomenal, and with which we can therefore
          never go beyond the phenomenal.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 23. The
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em> as a thing in itself is quite
          different from its phenomenal appearance, and entirely free from
          all the forms of the phenomenal, into which it first passes when it
          manifests itself, and which therefore only concern its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">objectivity</span></em>, and are foreign to
          the will itself. Even the most universal form of all idea, that of
          being object for a subject, does not concern it; still less the
          forms which are subordinate to this and which collectively have
          their common expression in the principle of sufficient reason, to
          which we know that time and space belong, and consequently
          multiplicity also, which exists and is possible only through these.
          In this last regard I shall call time and space the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium individuationis</span></span>,
          borrowing an expression from the old schoolmen, and I beg to draw
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page146">[pg 146]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg146"></a> attention to this,
          once for all. For it is only through the medium of time and space
          that what is one and the same, both according to its nature and to
          its concept, yet appears as different, as a multiplicity of
          co-existent and successive phenomena. Thus time and space are the
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium individuationis</span></span>, the
          subject of so many subtleties and disputes among the schoolmen,
          which may be found collected in Suarez (Disp. 5, Sect. 3).
          According to what has been said, the will as a thing-in-itself lies
          outside the province of the principle of sufficient reason in all
          its forms, and is consequently completely groundless, although all
          its manifestations are entirely subordinated to the principle of
          sufficient reason. Further, it is free from all <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">multiplicity</span></em>, although its
          manifestations in time and space are innumerable. It is itself one,
          though not in the sense in which an object is one, for the unity of
          an object can only be known in opposition to a possible
          multiplicity; nor yet in the sense in which a concept is one, for
          the unity of a concept originates only in abstraction from a
          multiplicity; but it is one as that which lies outside time and
          space, the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium
          individuationis</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          the possibility of multiplicity. Only when all this has become
          quite clear to us through the subsequent examination of the
          phenomena and different manifestations of the will, shall we fully
          understand the meaning of the Kantian doctrine that time, space and
          causality do not belong to the thing-in-itself, but are only forms
          of knowing.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The uncaused
          nature of will has been actually recognised, where it manifests
          itself most distinctly, as the will of man, and this has been
          called free, independent. But on account of the uncaused nature of
          the will itself, the necessity to which its manifestation is
          everywhere subjected has been overlooked, and actions are treated
          as free, which they are not. For every individual action follows
          with strict necessity from the effect of the motive upon the
          character. All necessity is, as we have already <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page147">[pg 147]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg147"></a> said, the relation of the consequent to
          the reason, and nothing more. The principle of sufficient reason is
          the universal form of all phenomena, and man in his action must be
          subordinated to it like every other phenomenon. But because in
          self-consciousness the will is known directly and in itself, in
          this consciousness lies also the consciousness of freedom. The fact
          is, however, overlooked that the individual, the person, is not
          will as a thing-in-itself, but is a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">phenomenon</span></em> of will, is already
          determined as such, and has come under the form of the phenomenal,
          the principle of sufficient reason. Hence arises the strange fact
          that every one believes himself <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          priori</span></span> to be perfectly free, even in his individual
          actions, and thinks that at every moment he can commence another
          manner of life, which just means that he can become another person.
          But <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a posteriori</span></span>,
          through experience, he finds to his astonishment that he is not
          free, but subjected to necessity; that in spite of all his
          resolutions and reflections he does not change his conduct, and
          that from the beginning of his life to the end of it, he must carry
          out the very character which he himself condemns, and as it were
          play the part he has undertaken to the end. I cannot pursue this
          subject further at present, for it belongs, as ethical, to another
          part of this work. In the meantime, I only wish to point out here
          that the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">phenomenon</span></em> of the will which in
          itself is uncaused, is yet as such subordinated to the law of
          necessity, that is, the principle of sufficient reason, so that in
          the necessity with which the phenomena of nature follow each other,
          we may find nothing to hinder us from recognising in them the
          manifestations of will.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Only those
          changes which have no other ground than a motive, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          an idea, have hitherto been regarded as manifestations of will.
          Therefore in nature a will has only been attributed to man, or at
          the most to animals; for knowledge, the idea, is of course, as I
          have said elsewhere, the true and exclusive characteristic of
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page148">[pg 148]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg148"></a> animal life. But
          that the will is also active where no knowledge guides it, we see
          at once in the instinct and the mechanical skill of animals.<a href="#note_31" id="noteref_31" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">31</span></span></a> That
          they have ideas and knowledge is here not to the point, for the end
          towards which they strive as definitely as if it were a known
          motive, is yet entirely unknown to them. Therefore in such cases
          their action takes place without motive, is not guided by the idea,
          and shows us first and most distinctly how the will may be active
          entirely without knowledge. The bird of a year old has no idea of
          the eggs for which it builds a nest; the young spider has no idea
          of the prey for which it spins a web; nor has the ant-lion any idea
          of the ants for which he digs a trench for the first time. The
          larva of the stag-beetle makes the hole in the wood, in which it is
          to await its metamorphosis, twice as big if it is going to be a
          male beetle as if it is going to be a female, so that if it is a
          male there may be room for the horns, of which, however, it has no
          idea. In such actions of these creatures the will is clearly
          operative as in their other actions, but it is in blind activity,
          which is indeed accompanied by knowledge but not guided by it. If
          now we have once gained insight into the fact, that idea as motive
          is not a necessary and essential condition of the activity of the
          will, we shall more easily recognise the activity of will where it
          is less apparent. For example, we shall see that the house of the
          snail is no more made by a will which is foreign to the snail
          itself, than the house which we build is produced through another
          will than our own; but we shall recognise in both houses the work
          of a will which objectifies itself in both the phenomena—a will
          which works in us according to motives, but in the snail still
          blindly as formative impulse directed outwards. In us also the same
          will is in many ways only blindly active: in all the functions of
          our body which are not guided by knowledge, in all its vital and
          vegetative processes, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page149">[pg
          149]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg149"></a>
          digestion, circulation, secretion, growth, reproduction. Not only
          the actions of the body, but the whole body itself is, as we have
          shown above, phenomenon of the will, objectified will, concrete
          will. All that goes on in it must therefore proceed through will,
          although here this will is not guided by knowledge, but acts
          blindly according to causes, which in this case are called
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">stimuli</span></em>.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I call a
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cause</span></em>, in the narrowest sense of
          the word, that state of matter, which, while it introduces another
          state with necessity, yet suffers just as great a change itself as
          that which it causes; which is expressed in the rule, <span class="tei tei-q">“action and reaction are equal.”</span> Further, in the
          case of what is properly speaking a cause, the effect increases
          directly in proportion to the cause, and therefore also the
          reaction. So that, if once the mode of operation be known, the
          degree of the effect may be measured and calculated from the degree
          of the intensity of the cause; and conversely the degree of the
          intensity of the cause may be calculated from the degree of the
          effect. Such causes, properly so called, operate in all the
          phenomena of mechanics, chemistry, and so forth; in short, in all
          the changes of unorganised bodies. On the other hand, I call a
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">stimulus</span></em>, such a cause as sustains
          no reaction proportional to its effect, and the intensity of which
          does not vary directly in proportion to the intensity of its
          effect, so that the effect cannot be measured by it. On the
          contrary, a small increase of the stimulus may cause a very great
          increase of the effect, or conversely, it may eliminate the
          previous effect altogether, and so forth. All effects upon
          organised bodies as such are of this kind. All properly organic and
          vegetative changes of the animal body must therefore be referred to
          stimuli, not to mere causes. But the stimulus, like every cause and
          motive generally, never determines more than the point of time and
          space at <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page150">[pg
          150]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg150"></a>
          which the manifestation of every force is to take place, and does
          not determine the inner nature of the force itself which is
          manifested. This inner nature we know, from our previous
          investigation, is will, to which therefore we ascribe both the
          unconscious and the conscious changes of the body. The stimulus
          holds the mean, forms the transition between the motive, which is
          causality accompanied throughout by knowledge, and the cause in the
          narrowest sense. In particular cases it is sometimes nearer a
          motive, sometimes nearer a cause, but yet it can always be
          distinguished from both. Thus, for example, the rising of the sap
          in a plant follows upon stimuli, and cannot be explained from mere
          causes, according to the laws of hydraulics or capillary
          attraction; yet it is certainly assisted by these, and altogether
          approaches very near to a purely causal change. On the other hand,
          the movements of the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Hedysarum
          gyrans</span></span> and the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Mimosa pudica</span></span>, although still
          following upon mere stimuli, are yet very like movements which
          follow upon motives, and seem almost to wish to make the
          transition. The contraction of the pupils of the eyes as the light
          is increased is due to stimuli, but it passes into movement which
          is due to motive; for it takes place, because too strong lights
          would affect the retina painfully, and to avoid this we contract
          the pupils. The occasion of an erection is a motive, because it is
          an idea, yet it operates with the necessity of a stimulus,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, it cannot be resisted, but
          we must put the idea away in order to make it cease to affect us.
          This is also the case with disgusting things, which excite the
          desire to vomit. Thus we have treated the instinct of animals as an
          actual link, of quite a distinct kind, between movement following
          upon stimuli, and action following upon a known motive. Now we
          might be asked to regard breathing as another link of this kind. It
          has been disputed whether it belongs to the voluntary or the
          involuntary movements, that is to say, whether it follows upon
          motive or stimulus, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page151">[pg
          151]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg151"></a>
          and perhaps it may be explained as something which is between the
          two. Marshall Hall (<span class="tei tei-q">“On the Diseases of the
          Nervous System,”</span> § 293 sq.) explains it as a mixed function,
          for it is partly under the influence of the cerebral (voluntary),
          and partly under that of the spinal (non-voluntary) nerves.
          However, we are finally obliged to number it with the expressions
          of will which result from motives. For other motives, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          mere ideas, can determine the will to check it or accelerate it,
          and, as is the case with every other voluntary action, it seems to
          us that we could give up breathing altogether and voluntarily
          suffocate. And in fact we could do so if any other motive
          influenced the will sufficiently strongly to overcome the pressing
          desire for air. According to some accounts Diogenes actually put an
          end to his life in this way (Diog. Laert. VI. 76). Certain negroes
          also are said to have done this (F. B. Osiander <span class="tei tei-q">“On Suicide”</span> [1813] pp. 170-180). If this be
          true, it affords us a good example of the influence of abstract
          motives, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, of the victory of
          distinctively rational over merely animal will. For, that breathing
          is at least partially conditioned by cerebral activity is shown by
          the fact that the primary cause of death from prussic acid is that
          it paralyses the brain, and so, indirectly, restricts the
          breathing; but if the breathing be artificially maintained till the
          stupefaction of the brain has passed away, death will not ensue. We
          may also observe in passing that breathing affords us the most
          obvious example of the fact that motives act with just as much
          necessity as stimuli, or as causes in the narrowest sense of the
          word, and their operation can only be neutralised by antagonistic
          motives, as action is neutralised by re-action. For, in the case of
          breathing, the illusion that we can stop when we like is much
          weaker than in the case of other movements which follow upon
          motives; because in breathing the motive is very powerful, very
          near to us, and its satisfaction is very easy, for the muscles
          which accomplish it are never tired, nothing, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page152">[pg 152]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg152"></a> as a rule, obstructs it, and the whole
          process is supported by the most inveterate habit of the
          individual. And yet all motives act with the same necessity. The
          knowledge that necessity is common to movements following upon
          motives, and those following upon stimuli, makes it easier for us
          to understand that that also which takes place in our bodily
          organism in accordance with stimuli and in obedience to law, is
          yet, according to its inner nature—will, which in all its
          manifestations, though never in itself, is subordinated to the
          principle of sufficient reason, that is, to necessity.<a href="#note_32" id="noteref_32" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">32</span></span></a>
          Accordingly, we shall not rest contented with recognising that
          animals, both in their actions and also in their whole existence,
          bodily structure and organisation, are manifestations of will; but
          we shall extend to plants also this immediate knowledge of the
          essential nature of things which is given to us alone. Now all the
          movements of plants follow upon stimuli; for the absence of
          knowledge, and the movement following upon motives which is
          conditioned by knowledge, constitutes the only essential difference
          between animals and plants. Therefore, what appears for the idea as
          plant life, as mere vegetation, as blindly impelling force, we
          shall claim, according to its inner nature, for will, and recognise
          it as just that which constitutes the basis of our own phenomenal
          being, as it expresses itself in our actions, and also in the whole
          existence of our body itself.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It only remains
          for us to take the final step, the extension of our way of looking
          at things to all those forces which act in nature in accordance
          with universal, unchangeable laws, in conformity with which the
          movements of all those bodies take place, which are wholly without
          organs, and have therefore no susceptibility for stimuli, and have
          no knowledge, which is the necessary condition <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page153">[pg 153]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg153"></a> of motives. Thus we must also apply the
          key to the understanding of the inner nature of things, which the
          immediate knowledge of our own existence alone can give us, to
          those phenomena of the unorganised world which are most remote from
          us. And if we consider them attentively, if we observe the strong
          and unceasing impulse with which the waters hurry to the ocean, the
          persistency with which the magnet turns ever to the north pole, the
          readiness with which iron flies to the magnet, the eagerness with
          which the electric poles seek to be re-united, and which, just like
          human desire, is increased by obstacles; if we see the crystal
          quickly and suddenly take form with such wonderful regularity of
          construction, which is clearly only a perfectly definite and
          accurately determined impulse in different directions, seized and
          retained by crystallisation; if we observe the choice with which
          bodies repel and attract each other, combine and separate, when
          they are set free in a fluid state, and emancipated from the bonds
          of rigidness; lastly, if we feel directly how a burden which
          hampers our body by its gravitation towards the earth, unceasingly
          presses and strains upon it in pursuit of its one tendency; if we
          observe all this, I say, it will require no great effort of the
          imagination to recognise, even at so great a distance, our own
          nature. That which in us pursues its ends by the light of
          knowledge; but here, in the weakest of its manifestations, only
          strives blindly and dumbly in a one-sided and unchangeable manner,
          must yet in both cases come under the name of will, as it is
          everywhere one and the same—just as the first dim light of dawn
          must share the name of sunlight with the rays of the full mid-day.
          For the name <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em> denotes that which is the
          inner nature of everything in the world, and the one kernel of
          every phenomenon.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yet the
          remoteness, and indeed the appearance of absolute difference
          between the phenomena of unorganised nature and the will which we
          know as the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page154">[pg
          154]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg154"></a>
          inner reality of our own being, arises chiefly from the contrast
          between the completely determined conformity to law of the one
          species of phenomena, and the apparently unfettered freedom of the
          other. For in man, individuality makes itself powerfully felt.
          Every one has a character of his own; and therefore the same motive
          has not the same influence over all, and a thousand circumstances
          which exist in the wide sphere of the knowledge of the individual,
          but are unknown to others, modify its effect. Therefore action
          cannot be predetermined from the motive alone, for the other factor
          is wanting, the accurate acquaintance with the individual
          character, and with the knowledge which accompanies it. On the
          other hand, the phenomena of the forces of nature illustrate the
          opposite extreme. They act according to universal laws, without
          variation, without individuality in accordance with openly manifest
          circumstances, subject to the most exact predetermination; and the
          same force of nature appears in its million phenomena in precisely
          the same way. In order to explain this point and prove the identity
          of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> indivisible will in all its
          different phenomena, in the weakest as in the strongest, we must
          first of all consider the relation of the will as thing-in-itself
          to its phenomena, that is, the relation of the world as will to the
          world as idea; for this will open to us the best way to a more
          thorough investigation of the whole subject we are considering in
          this second book.<a href="#note_33" id="noteref_33" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">33</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 24. We have
          learnt from the great Kant that time, space, and causality, with
          their entire constitution, and the possibility of all their forms,
          are present in our consciousness quite independently of the objects
          which appear in them, and which constitute their content; or, in
          other words, they can be arrived at just as well if we <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page155">[pg 155]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg155"></a> start from the subject as if we start
          from the object. Therefore, with equal accuracy, we may call them
          either forms of intuition or perception of the subject, or
          qualities of the object <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as object</span></em> (with Kant, phenomenon),
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">idea</span></em>.
          We may also regard these forms as the irreducible boundary between
          object and subject. All objects must therefore exist in them, yet
          the subject, independently of the phenomenal object, possesses and
          surveys them completely. But if the objects appearing in these
          forms are not to be empty phantoms, but are to have a meaning, they
          must refer to something, must be the expression of something which
          is not, like themselves, object, idea, a merely relative existence
          for a subject, but which exists without such dependence upon
          something which stands over against it as a condition of its being,
          and independent of the forms of such a thing, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is not
          idea</span></em>, but a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thing-in-itself</span></em>. Consequently it
          may at least be asked: Are these ideas, these objects, something
          more than or apart from the fact that they are ideas, objects of
          the subject? And what would they be in this sense? What is that
          other side of them which is <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">toto
          genere</span></span> different from idea? What is the
          thing-in-itself? <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">The will</span></em>, we have answered, but
          for the present I set that answer aside.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whatever the
          thing-in-itself may be, Kant is right in his conclusion that time,
          space, and causality (which we afterwards found to be forms of the
          principle of sufficient reason, the general expression of the forms
          of the phenomenon) are not its properties, but come to it only
          after, and so far as, it has become idea. That is, they belong only
          to its phenomenal existence, not to itself. For since the subject
          fully understands and constructs them out of itself, independently
          of all object, they must be dependent upon <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">existence as
          idea</span></em> as such, not upon that which becomes idea. They
          must be the form of the idea as such; but not qualities of that
          which has assumed this form. They must be already given with the
          mere antithesis of subject <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page156">[pg 156]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg156"></a> and object (not as concepts but as facts),
          and consequently they must be only the more exact determination of
          the form of knowledge in general, whose most universal
          determination is that antithesis itself. Now, that in the
          phenomenon, in the object, which is in its turn conditioned by
          time, space and causality, inasmuch as it can only become idea by
          means of them, namely <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">multiplicity</span></em>, through co-existence
          and succession, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">change</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">permanence</span></em> through the law of
          causality, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">matter</span></em> which can only become idea
          under the presupposition of causality, and lastly, all that becomes
          idea only by means of these,—all this, I say, as a whole, does not
          in reality belong to that which appears, to that which has passed
          into the form of idea, but belongs merely to this form itself. And
          conversely, that in the phenomenon which is not conditioned through
          time, space and causality, and which cannot be referred to them,
          nor explained in accordance with them, is precisely that in which
          the thing manifested, the thing-in-itself, directly reveals itself.
          It follows from this that the most complete capacity for being
          known, that is to say, the greatest clearness, distinctness, and
          susceptibility of exhaustive explanation, will necessarily belong
          to that which pertains to knowledge <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as
          such</span></em>, and thus to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">form</span></em> of
          knowledge; but not to that which in itself is not idea, not object,
          but which has become knowledge only through entering these forms;
          in other words, has become idea, object. Thus only that which
          depends entirely upon being an object of knowledge, upon existing
          as idea in general and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as such</span></em> (not upon that which
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">becomes</span></em> known, and has only
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">become</span></em> idea), which therefore
          belongs without distinction to everything that is known, and which,
          on that account, is found just as well if we start from the subject
          as if we start from the object,—this alone can afford us without
          reserve a sufficient, exhaustive knowledge, a knowledge which is
          clear to the very foundation. But this consists of nothing but
          those forms of all phenomena of which we are conscious <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page157">[pg 157]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg157"></a> <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          priori</span></span>, and which may be generally expressed as the
          principle of sufficient reason. Now, the forms of this principle
          which occur in knowledge of perception (with which alone we are
          here concerned) are time, space, and causality. The whole of pure
          mathematics and pure natural science <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          priori</span></span> is based entirely upon these. Therefore it is
          only in these sciences that knowledge finds no obscurity, does not
          rest upon what is incomprehensible (groundless, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          will), upon what cannot be further deduced. It is on this account
          that Kant wanted, as we have said, to apply the name science
          specially and even exclusively to these branches of knowledge
          together with logic. But, on the other hand, these branches of
          knowledge show us nothing more than mere connections, relations of
          one idea to another, form devoid of all content. All content which
          they receive, every phenomenon which fills these forms, contains
          something which is no longer completely knowable in its whole
          nature, something which can no longer be entirely explained through
          something else, something then which is groundless, through which
          consequently the knowledge loses its evidence and ceases to be
          completely lucid. This that withholds itself from investigation,
          however, is the thing-in-itself, is that which is essentially not
          idea, not object of knowledge, but has only become knowable by
          entering that form. The form is originally foreign to it, and the
          thing-in-itself can never become entirely one with it, can never be
          referred to mere form, and, since this form is the principle of
          sufficient reason, can never be completely explained. If therefore
          all mathematics affords us an exhaustive knowledge of that which in
          the phenomena is quantity, position, number, in a word, spatial and
          temporal relations; if all etiology gives us a complete account of
          the regular conditions under which phenomena, with all their
          determinations, appear in time and space, but, with it all, teaches
          us nothing more than why in each case this particular phenomenon
          must appear <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page158">[pg
          158]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg158"></a>
          just at this time here, and at this place now; it is clear that
          with their assistance we can never penetrate to the inner nature of
          things. There always remains something which no explanation can
          venture to attack, but which it always presupposes; the forces of
          nature, the definite mode of operation of things, the quality and
          character of every phenomenon, that which is without ground, that
          which does not depend upon the form of the phenomenal, the
          principle of sufficient reason, but is something to which this form
          in itself is foreign, something which has yet entered this form,
          and now appears according to its law, a law, however, which only
          determines the appearance, not that which appears, only the how,
          not the what, only the form, not the content. Mechanics, physics,
          and chemistry teach the rules and laws according to which the
          forces of impenetrability, gravitation, rigidity, fluidity,
          cohesion, elasticity, heat, light, affinity, magnetism,
          electricity, &amp;c., operate; that is to say, the law, the rule
          which these forces observe whenever they enter time and space. But
          do what we will, the forces themselves remain <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">qualitates occultæ</span></span>. For it is
          just the thing-in-itself, which, because it is manifested, exhibits
          these phenomena, which are entirely different from itself. In its
          manifestation, indeed, it is completely subordinated to the
          principle of sufficient reason as the form of the idea, but it can
          never itself be referred to this form, and therefore cannot be
          fully explained etiologically, can never be completely fathomed. It
          is certainly perfectly comprehensible so far as it has assumed that
          form, that is, so far as it is phenomenon, but its inner nature is
          not in the least explained by the fact that it can thus be
          comprehended. Therefore the more necessity any knowledge carries
          with it, the more there is in it of that which cannot be otherwise
          thought or presented in perception—as, for example,
          space-relations—the clearer and more sufficing then it is, the less
          pure objective content it has, or the less reality, properly so
          called, is <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page159">[pg
          159]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg159"></a>
          given in it. And conversely, the more there is in it which must be
          conceived as mere chance, and the more it impresses us as given
          merely empirically, the more proper objectivity and true reality is
          there in such knowledge, and at the same time, the more that is
          inexplicable, that is, that cannot be deduced from anything
          else.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is true that
          at all times an etiology, unmindful of its real aim, has striven to
          reduce all organised life to chemism or electricity; all chemism,
          that is to say quality, again to mechanism (action determined by
          the shape of the atom), this again sometimes to the object of
          phoronomy, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the combination of time
          and space, which makes motion possible, sometimes to the object of
          mere geometry, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, position in space (much in
          the same way as we rightly deduce the diminution of an effect from
          the square of the distance, and the theory of the lever in a purely
          geometrical manner): geometry may finally be reduced to arithmetic,
          which, on account of its one dimension, is of all the forms of the
          principle of sufficient reason, the most intelligible,
          comprehensible, and completely susceptible of investigation. As
          instances of the method generally indicated here, we may refer to
          the atoms of Democritus, the vortex of Descartes, the mechanical
          physics of Lesage, which towards the end of last century tried to
          explain both chemical affinities and gravitation mechanically by
          impact and pressure, as may be seen in detail in <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lucrèce Neutonien</span></span>;”</span>
          Reil's form and combination as the cause of animal life, also tends
          in this direction. Finally, the crude materialism which even now in
          the middle of the nineteenth century has been served up again under
          the ignorant delusion that it is original, belongs distinctly to
          this class. It stupidly denies vital force, and first of all tries
          to explain the phenomena of life from physical and chemical forces,
          and those again from the mechanical effects of the matter,
          position, form, and motion of imagined atoms, and thus <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page160">[pg 160]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg160"></a> seeks to reduce all the forces of
          nature to action and reaction as its thing-in-itself. According to
          this teaching, light is the mechanical vibration or undulation of
          an imaginary ether, postulated for this end. This ether, if it
          reaches the eye, beats rapidly upon the retina, and gives us the
          knowledge of colour. Thus, for example, four hundred and
          eighty-three billion beats in a second give red, and seven hundred
          and twenty-seven billion beats in a second give violet. Upon this
          theory, persons who are colour-blind must be those who are unable
          to count the beats, must they not? Such crass, mechanical, clumsy,
          and certainly knotty theories, which remind one of Democritus, are
          quite worthy of those who, fifty years after the appearance of
          Goethe's doctrine of colour, still believe in Newton's homogeneous
          light, and are not ashamed to say so. They will find that what is
          overlooked in the child (Democritus) will not be forgiven to the
          man. They might indeed, some day, come to an ignominious end; but
          then every one would slink away and pretend that he never had
          anything to do with them. We shall soon have to speak again of this
          false reduction of the forces of nature to each other; so much for
          the present. Supposing this theory were possible, all would
          certainly be explained and established and finally reduced to an
          arithmetical problem, which would then be the holiest thing in the
          temple of wisdom, to which the principle of sufficient reason would
          at last have happily conducted us. But all content of the
          phenomenon would have disappeared, and the mere form would remain.
          The <span class="tei tei-q">“what appears”</span> would be referred
          to the <span class="tei tei-q">“how it appears,”</span> and this
          <span class="tei tei-q">“how”</span> would be what is <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span> knowable, therefore
          entirely dependent on the subject, therefore only for the subject,
          therefore, lastly, mere phantom, idea and form of idea, through and
          through: no thing-in-itself could be demanded. Supposing, then,
          that this were possible, the whole world would be derived from the
          subject, and in fact, that would be accomplished which <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page161">[pg 161]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg161"></a> Fichte wanted to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">seem</span></em> to
          accomplish by his empty bombast. But it is not possible:
          phantasies, sophisms, castles in the air, have been constructed in
          this way, but science never. The many and multifarious phenomena in
          nature have been successfully referred to particular original
          forces, and as often as this has been done, a real advance has been
          made. Several forces and qualities, which were at first regarded as
          different, have been derived from each other, and thus their number
          has been curtailed. (For example, magnetism from electricity.)
          Etiology will have reached its goal when it has recognised and
          exhibited as such all the original forces of nature, and
          established their mode of operation, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          the law according to which, under the guidance of causality, their
          phenomena appear in time and space, and determine their position
          with regard to each other. But certain original forces will always
          remain over; there will always remain as an insoluble residuum a
          content of phenomena which cannot be referred to their form, and
          thus cannot be explained from something else in accordance with the
          principle of sufficient reason. For in everything in nature there
          is something of which no ground can ever be assigned, of which no
          explanation is possible, and no ulterior cause is to be sought.
          This is the specific nature of its action, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          the nature of its existence, its being. Of each particular effect
          of the thing a cause may be certainly indicated, from which it
          follows that it must act just at this time and in this place; but
          no cause can ever be found from which it follows that a thing acts
          in general, and precisely in the way it does. If it has no other
          qualities, if it is merely a mote in a sunbeam, it yet exhibits
          this unfathomable something, at least as weight and
          impenetrability. But this, I say, is to the mote what his will is
          to a man; and, like the human will, it is, according to its inner
          nature, not subject to explanation; nay, more—it is in itself
          identical with this will. It is true that a motive may be given for
          every manifestation <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page162">[pg
          162]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg162"></a>
          of will, for every act of will at a particular time and in a
          particular place, upon which it must necessarily follow, under the
          presupposition of the character of the man. But no reason can ever
          be given that the man has this character; that he wills at all;
          that, of several motives, just this one and no other, or indeed
          that any motive at all, moves his will. That which in the case of
          man is the unfathomable character which is presupposed in every
          explanation of his actions from motives is, in the case of every
          unorganised body, its definitive quality—the mode of its action,
          the manifestations of which are occasioned by impressions from
          without, while it itself, on the contrary, is determined by nothing
          outside itself, and thus is also inexplicable. Its particular
          manifestations, through which alone it becomes visible, are
          subordinated to the principle of sufficient reason; it itself is
          groundless. This was in substance rightly understood by the
          schoolmen, who called it <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">forma
          substantialis</span></span>. (Cf. Suarez, Disput. Metaph., disp.
          xv. sect. 1.)</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is a greater
          and a commoner error that the phenomena which we best understand
          are those which are of most frequent occurrence, and which are most
          universal and simple; for, on the contrary, these are just the
          phenomena that we are most accustomed to see about us, and to be
          ignorant of. It is just as inexplicable to us that a stone should
          fall to the earth as that an animal should move itself. It has been
          supposed, as we have remarked above, that, starting from the most
          universal forces of nature (gravitation, cohesion,
          impenetrability), it was possible to explain from them the rarer
          forces, which only operate under a combination of circumstances
          (for example, chemical quality, electricity, magnetism), and,
          lastly, from these to understand the organism and the life of
          animals, and even the nature of human knowing and willing. Men
          resigned themselves without a word to starting from mere
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">qualitates occultæ</span></span>, the
          elucidation of which was entirely given up, for they intended to
          build <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page163">[pg 163]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg163"></a> upon them, not to
          investigate them. Such an intention cannot, as we have already
          said, be carried out. But apart from this, such structures would
          always stand in the air. What is the use of explanations which
          ultimately refer us to something which is quite as unknown as the
          problem with which we started? Do we in the end understand more of
          the inner nature of these universal natural forces than of the
          inner nature of an animal? Is not the one as much a sealed book to
          us as the other? Unfathomable because it is without ground, because
          it is the content, that which the phenomenon is, and which can
          never be referred to the form, to the how, to the principle of
          sufficient reason. But we, who have in view not etiology but
          philosophy, that is, not relative but unconditioned knowledge of
          the real nature of the world, take the opposite course, and start
          from that which is immediately and most completely known to us, and
          fully and entirely trusted by us—that which lies nearest to us, in
          order to understand that which is known to us only at a distance,
          one-sidedly and indirectly. From the most powerful, most
          significant, and most distinct phenomenon we seek to arrive at an
          understanding of those that are less complete and weaker. With the
          exception of my own body, all things are known to me only on
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> side, that of the idea. Their
          inner nature remains hidden from me and a profound secret, even if
          I know all the causes from which their changes follow. Only by
          comparison with that which goes on in me if my body performs an
          action when I am influenced by a motive—only by comparison, I say,
          with what is the inner nature of my own changes determined by
          external reasons, can I obtain insight into the way in which these
          lifeless bodies change under the influence of causes, and so
          understand what is their inner nature. For the knowledge of the
          causes of the manifestation of this inner nature affords me merely
          the rule of its appearance in time and space, and nothing more. I
          can make this comparison because <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page164">[pg 164]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg164"></a> my body is the only object of which I know
          not merely the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> side, that of the idea, but
          also the other side which is called will. Thus, instead of
          believing that I would better understand my own organisation, and
          then my own knowing and willing, and my movements following upon
          motives, if I could only refer them to movements due to electrical,
          chemical, and mechanical causes, I must, seeing that I seek
          philosophy and not etiology, learn to understand from my own
          movements following upon motives the inner nature of the simplest
          and commonest movements of an unorganised body which I see
          following upon causes. I must recognise the inscrutable forces
          which manifest themselves in all natural bodies as identical in
          kind with that which in me is the will, and as differing from it
          only in degree. That is to say, the fourth class of ideas given in
          the Essay on the Principle of Sufficient Reason must be the key to
          the knowledge of the inner nature of the first class, and by means
          of the law of motivation I must come to understand the inner
          meaning of the law of causation.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Spinoza (Epist.
          62) says that if a stone which has been projected through the air
          had consciousness, it would believe that it was moving of its own
          will. I add to this only that the stone would be right. The impulse
          given it is for the stone what the motive is for me, and what in
          the case of the stone appears as cohesion, gravitation, rigidity,
          is in its inner nature the same as that which I recognise in myself
          as will, and what the stone also, if knowledge were given to it,
          would recognise as will. In the passage referred to, Spinoza had in
          view the necessity with which the stone flies, and he rightly
          desires to transfer this necessity to that of the particular act of
          will of a person. I, on the other hand, consider the inner being,
          which alone imparts meaning and validity to all real necessity
          (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, effect following upon a
          cause) as its presupposition. In the case of men this is called
          character; in the case of a stone it is called quality, but it is
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page165">[pg 165]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg165"></a> the same in both.
          When it is immediately known it is called will. In the stone it has
          the weakest, and in man the strongest degree of visibility, of
          objectivity. St. Augustine recognises, with a true instinct, this
          identity of the tendencies of all things with our own willing, and
          I cannot refrain from quoting his naïve account of the
          matter:—<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Si
          pecora essemus, carnalem vitam et quod secundum sensum ejusdem est
          amaremus, idque esset sufficiens bonum nostrum, et secundum hoc si
          esset nobis bene, nihil aliud quæreremus. Item, si arbores essemus,
          nihil quidem sentientes motu amare possemus: verumtamen id quasi
          appetere videremur, quo feracius essemus, uberiusque fructuosæ. Si
          essemus lapides, aut fluctus, aut ventus, aut flamma, vel quid
          ejusmodi, sine ullo quidem sensu atque vita, non tamen nobis
          deesset quasi quidam nostrorum locorum atque ordinis appetitus. Nam
          velut amores corporum momenta sunt ponderum, sive deorsum

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It ought further
          to be mentioned that Euler saw that the inner nature of gravitation
          must ultimately be referred to an <span class="tei tei-q">“inclination and desire”</span> (thus will) peculiar to
          material bodies (in the 68th letter to the Princess). Indeed, it is
          just this that makes him averse to the conception of gravitation as
          it existed for Newton, and he is inclined to try a modification of
          it in accordance with the earlier Cartesian theory, and so to
          derive gravitation from the impact of an ether upon the bodies, as
          being <span class="tei tei-q">“more rational and more suitable for
          persons who like clear and intelligible principles.”</span> He
          wishes to banish attraction from physics as a <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">qualitas occulta</span></span>. This is only
          in keeping with the dead view of nature which prevailed at Euler's
          time as the correlative of the immaterial soul. It is only worth
          noticing because of its bearing upon the fundamental truth
          established by me, which even at that time this fine intellect saw
          glimmering in the distance. He hastened to turn in time, and then,
          in his anxiety at <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page166">[pg

          seeing all the prevalent fundamental views endangered, he sought

          them. In this respect they are called the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium individuationis</span></span>. But
          we have found that space and time are forms of the principle of
          sufficient reason. In this principle all our knowledge <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span> is expressed, but, as
          we showed above, this <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          priori</span></span> knowledge, as such, only applies to the
          knowableness of things, not to the things themselves, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          it is only our form of knowledge, it is not a property of the
          thing-in-itself. The thing-in-itself is, as such, free from all
          forms of knowledge, even the most universal, that of being an
          object for the subject. In other words, the thing-in-itself is
          something altogether different from the idea. If, now, this
          thing-in-itself is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the will</span></em>, as I believe I have
          fully and convincingly proved it to be, then, regarded as such and
          apart from its manifestation, it lies outside time and space, and
          therefore knows no multiplicity, and is consequently <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em>.
          Yet, as I have said, it is not one in the sense in which an
          individual or a concept is one, but as something to which the
          condition of the possibility of multiplicity, the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium individuationis</span></span>, is
          foreign. The multiplicity of things in space and time, which
          collectively constitute the objectification of will, does not
          affect the will itself, which remains indivisible notwithstanding
          it. It is not the case that, in some way or other, a smaller part
          of will is in the stone and a larger part in the man, for the
          relation of part and whole belongs exclusively to space, and has no
          longer any meaning when we go beyond this form of intuition or
          perception. The more and the less have application only to the
          phenomenon of will, that is, its visibility, its objectification.
          Of this there is a higher grade in the plant than in the stone; in
          the animal a higher grade than in the plant: indeed, the passage of
          will into visibility, its <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page167">[pg
          167]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg167"></a>
          objectification, has grades as innumerable as exist between the
          dimmest twilight and the brightest sunshine, the loudest sound and
          the faintest echo. We shall return later to the consideration of
          these grades of visibility which belong to the objectification of
          the will, to the reflection of its nature. But as the grades of its
          objectification do not directly concern the will itself, still less
          is it concerned by the multiplicity of the phenomena of these
          different grades, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the multitude of
          individuals of each form, or the particular manifestations of each
          force. For this multiplicity is directly conditioned by time and
          space, into which the will itself never enters. The will reveals
          itself as completely and as much in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> oak
          as in millions. Their number and multiplication in space and time
          has no meaning with regard to it, but only with regard to the
          multiplicity of individuals who know in space and time, and who are
          themselves multiplied and dispersed in these. The multiplicity of
          these individuals itself belongs not to the will, but only to its
          manifestation. We may therefore say that if, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">per
          impossibile</span></span>, a single real existence, even the most
          insignificant, were to be entirely annihilated, the whole world
          would necessarily perish with it. The great mystic Angelus Silesius
          feels this when he says—</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Men have tried
          in various ways to bring the immeasurable greatness of the material
          universe nearer to the comprehension of us all, and then they have
          seized the opportunity to make edifying remarks. They have referred
          perhaps to the relative smallness of the earth, and indeed of man;
          or, on the contrary, they have pointed out the greatness of the
          mind of this man who is so insignificant—the mind that can solve,
          comprehend, and even measure the greatness of the universe, and so
          forth. Now, all this is very well, but to me, when I consider the
          vastness <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page168">[pg
          168]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg168"></a>
          of the world, the most important point is this, that the
          thing-in-itself, whose manifestation is the world—whatever else it
          may be—cannot have its true self spread out and dispersed after
          this fashion in boundless space, but that this endless extension
          belongs only to its manifestation. The thing-in-itself, on the
          contrary, is present entire and undivided in every object of nature
          and in every living being. Therefore we lose nothing by standing
          still beside any single individual thing, and true wisdom is not to
          be gained by measuring out the boundless world, or, what would be
          more to the purpose, by actually traversing endless space. It is
          rather to be attained by the thorough investigation of any
          individual thing, for thus we seek to arrive at a full knowledge
          and understanding of its true and peculiar nature.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The subject
          which will therefore be fully considered in the next book, and
          which has, doubtless, already presented itself to the mind of every
          student of Plato, is, that these different grades of the
          objectification of will which are manifested in innumerable
          individuals, and exist as their unattained types or as the eternal
          forms of things, not entering themselves into time and space, which
          are the medium of individual things, but remaining fixed, subject
          to no change, always being, never becoming, while the particular
          things arise and pass away, always become and never are,—that these
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">grades of
          the objectification of will</span></em> are, I say, simply
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Plato's
          Ideas</span></em>. I make this passing reference to the matter here
          in order that I may be able in future to use the word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Idea</span></em> in
          this sense. In my writings, therefore, the word is always to be
          understood in its true and original meaning given to it by Plato,
          and has absolutely no reference to those abstract productions of
          dogmatising scholastic reason, which Kant has inaptly and
          illegitimately used this word to denote, though Plato had already
          appropriated and used it most fitly. By Idea, then, I understand
          every definite and fixed grade of the objectification <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page169">[pg 169]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg169"></a> of will, so far as it is
          thing-in-itself, and therefore has no multiplicity. These grades
          are related to individual things as their eternal forms or
          prototypes. The shortest and most concise statement of this famous
          Platonic doctrine is given us by Diogenes Laertes (iii. 12):
          <span class="tei tei-q">“ὁ Πλατων φησι, εν τῃ φυσει τας ιδεας
          ἑσταναι, καθαπερ παραδειγματα, τα δ᾽ αλλα ταυταις εοικεναι, τουτων
          ὁμοιωματα καθεστωτα”</span>—(<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Plato ideas in natura velut exemplaria dixit
          subsistere; cetera his esse similia, ad istarum similitudinem
          consistentia</span></span>”</span>). Of Kant's misuse of the word I
          take no further notice; what it is needful to say about it will be
          found in the Appendix.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 26. The lowest
          grades of the objectification of will are to be found in those most
          universal forces of nature which partly appear in all matter
          without exception, as gravity and impenetrability, and partly have
          shared the given matter among them, so that certain of them reign
          in one species of matter and others in another species,
          constituting its specific difference, as rigidity, fluidity,
          elasticity, electricity, magnetism, chemical properties and
          qualities of every kind. They are in themselves immediate
          manifestations of will, just as much as human action; and as such
          they are groundless, like human character. Only their particular
          manifestations are subordinated to the principle of sufficient
          reason, like the particular actions of men. They themselves, on the
          other hand, can never be called either effect or cause, but are the
          prior and presupposed conditions of all causes and effects through
          which their real nature unfolds and reveals itself. It is therefore
          senseless to demand a cause of gravity or electricity, for they are
          original forces. Their expressions, indeed, take place in
          accordance with the law of cause and effect, so that every one of
          their particular manifestations has a cause, which is itself again
          just a similar particular manifestation which determines that this
          force must express itself here, must appear in space and time; but
          the force itself is by no means the effect of a cause, nor the
          cause of an <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page170">[pg
          170]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg170"></a>
          effect. It is therefore a mistake to say <span class="tei tei-q">“gravity is the cause of a stone falling;”</span> for
          the cause in this case is rather the nearness of the earth, because
          it attracts the stone. Take the earth away and the stone will not
          fall, although gravity remains. The force itself lies quite outside
          the chain of causes and effects, which presupposes time, because it
          only has meaning in relation to it; but the force lies outside
          time. The individual change always has for its cause another change
          just as individual as itself, and not the force of which it is the
          expression. For that which always gives its efficiency to a cause,
          however many times it may appear, is a force of nature. As such, it
          is groundless, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, it lies outside the chain
          of causes and outside the province of the principle of sufficient
          reason in general, and is philosophically known as the immediate
          objectivity of will, which is the <span class="tei tei-q">“in-itself”</span> of the whole of nature; but in
          etiology, which in this reference is physics, it is set down as an
          original force, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, a <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">qualitas occulta</span></span>.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the higher
          grades of the objectivity of will we see individuality occupy a
          prominent position, especially in the case of man, where it appears
          as the great difference of individual characters, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          as complete personality, outwardly expressed in strongly marked
          individual physiognomy, which influences the whole bodily form.
          None of the brutes have this individuality in anything like so high
          a degree, though the higher species of them have a trace of it; but
          the character of the species completely predominates over it, and
          therefore they have little individual physiognomy. The farther down
          we go, the more completely is every trace of the individual
          character lost in the common character of the species, and the
          physiognomy of the species alone remains. We know the physiological
          character of the species, and from that we know exactly what is to
          be expected from the individual; while, on the contrary, in the
          human species every individual has to be studied and fathomed for
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page171">[pg 171]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg171"></a> himself, which, if
          we wish to forecast his action with some degree of certainty, is,
          on account of the possibility of concealment that first appears
          with reason, a matter of the greatest difficulty. It is probably
          connected with this difference of the human species from all
          others, that the folds and convolutions of the brain, which are
          entirely wanting in birds, and very weakly marked in rodents, are
          even in the case of the higher animals far more symmetrical on both
          sides, and more constantly the same in each individual, than in the
          case of human beings.<a href="#note_34" id="noteref_34" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">34</span></span></a> It is
          further to be regarded as a phenomenon of this peculiar individual
          character which distinguishes men from all the lower animals, that
          in the case of the brutes the sexual instinct seeks its
          satisfaction without observable choice of objects, while in the
          case of man this choice is, in a purely instinctive manner and
          independent of all reflection, carried so far that it rises into a
          powerful passion. While then every man is to be regarded as a
          specially determined and characterised phenomenon of will, and
          indeed to a certain extent as a special Idea, in the case of the
          brutes this individual character as a whole is wanting, because
          only the species has a special significance. And the farther we go
          from man, the fainter becomes the trace of this individual
          character, so that plants have no individual qualities left, except
          such as may be fully explained from the favourable or unfavourable
          external influences of soil, climate, and other accidents. Finally,
          in the inorganic kingdom of nature all individuality disappears.
          The crystal alone is to be regarded as to a certain extent
          individual. It is a unity of the tendency in definite directions,
          fixed by crystallisation, which makes the trace of this tendency
          permanent. It is at the same time a cumulative repetition of its
          primitive form, bound into unity by an idea, just as the
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page172">[pg 172]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg172"></a> tree is an aggregate
          of the single germinating fibre which shows itself in every rib of
          the leaves, in every leaf, in every branch; which repeats itself,
          and to some extent makes each of these appear as a separate growth,
          nourishing itself from the greater as a parasite, so that the tree,
          resembling the crystal, is a systematic aggregate of small plants,
          although only the whole is the complete expression of an individual
          Idea, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, of this particular grade
          of the objectification of will. But the individuals of the same
          species of crystal can have no other difference than such as is
          produced by external accidents; indeed we can make at pleasure
          large or small crystals of every species. The individual, however,
          as such, that is, with traces of an individual character, does not
          exist further in unorganised nature. All its phenomena are
          expressions of general forces of nature, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          of those grades of the objectification of will which do not
          objectify themselves (as is the case in organised nature), by means
          of the difference of the individualities which collectively express
          the whole of the Idea, but show themselves only in the species, and
          as a whole, without any variation in each particular example of it.
          Time, space, multiplicity, and existence conditioned by causes, do
          not belong to the will or to the Idea (the grade of the
          objectification of will), but only to their particular phenomena.
          Therefore such a force of nature as, for example, gravity or
          electricity, must show itself as such in precisely the same way in
          all its million phenomena, and only external circumstances can
          modify these. This unity of its being in all its phenomena, this
          unchangeable constancy of the appearance of these, whenever, under
          the guidance of causality, the necessary conditions are present, is
          called a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">law of nature</span></em>. If such a law is
          once learned from experience, then the phenomenon of that force of
          nature, the character of which is expressed and laid down in it,
          may be accurately forecast and counted upon. But it is just this
          conformity to law of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page173">[pg
          173]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg173"></a>
          phenomena of the lower grades of the objectification of will which
          gives them such a different aspect from the phenomena of the same
          will in the higher, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the more distinct, grades
          of its objectification, in animals, and in men and their actions,
          where the stronger or weaker influence of the individual character
          and the susceptibility to motives which often remain hidden from
          the spectator, because they lie in knowledge, has had the result
          that the identity of the inner nature of the two kinds of phenomena
          has hitherto been entirely overlooked.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If we start from
          the knowledge of the particular, and not from that of the Idea,
          there is something astonishing, and sometimes even terrible, in the
          absolute uniformity of the laws of nature. It might astonish us
          that nature never once forgets her laws; that if, for example, it
          has once been according to a law of nature that where certain
          materials are brought together under given conditions, a chemical
          combination will take place, or gas will be evolved, or they will
          go on fire; if these conditions are fulfilled, whether by our
          interposition or entirely by chance (and in this case the accuracy
          is the more astonishing because unexpected), to-day just as well as
          a thousand years ago, the determined phenomenon will take place at
          once and without delay. We are most vividly impressed with the
          marvellousness of this fact in the case of rare phenomena, which
          only occur under very complex circumstances, but which we are
          previously informed will take place if these conditions are
          fulfilled. For example, when we are told that if certain metals,
          when arranged alternately in fluid with which an acid has been
          mixed, are brought into contact, silver leaf brought between the
          extremities of this combination will suddenly be consumed in a
          green flame; or that under certain conditions the hard diamond
          turns into carbonic acid. It is the ghostly omnipresence of natural
          forces that astonishes us in such <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page174">[pg 174]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg174"></a> cases, and we remark here what in the case of
          phenomena which happen daily no longer strikes us, how the
          connection between cause and effect is really as mysterious as that
          which is imagined between a magic formula and a spirit that must
          appear when invoked by it. On the other hand, if we have attained
          to the philosophical knowledge that a force of nature is a definite
          grade of the objectification of will, that is to say, a definite
          grade of that which we recognise as our own inmost nature, and that
          this will, in itself, and distinguished from its phenomena and
          their forms, lies outside time and space, and that, therefore, the
          multiplicity, which is conditioned by time and space, does not
          belong to it, nor directly to the grade of its objectification,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the Idea, but only to the
          phenomena of the Idea; and if we remember that the law of causality
          has significance only in relation to time and space, inasmuch as it
          determines the position of the multitude of phenomena of the
          different Ideas in which the will reveals itself, governing the
          order in which they must appear; if, I say, in this knowledge the
          inner meaning of the great doctrine of Kant has been fully grasped,
          the doctrine that time, space, and causality do not belong to the
          thing-in-itself, but merely to the phenomenon, that they are only
          the forms of our knowledge, not qualities of things in themselves;
          then we shall understand that this astonishment at the conformity
          to law and accurate operation of a force of nature, this
          astonishment at the complete sameness of all its million phenomena
          and the infallibility of their occurrence, is really like that of a
          child or a savage who looks for the first time through a glass with
          many facets at a flower, and marvels at the complete similarity of
          the innumerable flowers which he sees, and counts the leaves of
          each of them separately.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus every
          universal, original force of nature is nothing but a low grade of
          the objectification of will, and we call <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page175">[pg 175]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg175"></a> every such grade an eternal <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Idea</span></em> in
          Plato's sense. But a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">law of nature</span></em> is the relation of
          the Idea to the form of its manifestation. This form is time,
          space, and causality, which are necessarily and inseparably
          connected and related to each other. Through time and space the
          Idea multiplies itself in innumerable phenomena, but the order
          according to which it enters these forms of multiplicity is
          definitely determined by the law of causality; this law is as it
          were the norm of the limit of these phenomena of different Ideas,
          in accordance with which time, space, and matter are assigned to
          them. This norm is therefore necessarily related to the identity of
          the aggregate of existing matter, which is the common substratum of
          all those different phenomena. If all these were not directed to
          that common matter in the possession of which they must be divided,
          there would be no need for such a law to decide their claims. They
          might all at once and together fill a boundless space throughout an
          endless time. Therefore, because all these phenomena of the eternal
          Ideas are directed to one and the same matter, must there be a rule
          for their appearance and disappearance; for if there were not, they
          would not make way for each other. Thus the law of causality is
          essentially bound up with that of the permanence of substance; they
          reciprocally derive significance from each other. Time and space,
          again, are related to them in the same way. For time is merely the
          possibility of conflicting states of the same matter, and space is
          merely the possibility of the permanence of the same matter under
          all sorts of conflicting states. Accordingly, in the preceding book
          we explained matter as the union of space and time, and this union
          shows itself as change of the accidents in the permanence of the
          substance, of which causality or becoming is the universal
          possibility. And accordingly, we said that matter is through and
          through causality. We explained the understanding as the subjective
          correlative of causality, and said matter (and thus the whole
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page176">[pg 176]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg176"></a> world as idea)
          exists only for the understanding; the understanding is its
          condition, its supporter as its necessary correlative. I repeat all
          this in passing, merely to call to mind what was demonstrated in
          the First Book, for it is necessary for the complete understanding
          of these two books that their inner agreement should be observed,
          since what is inseparably united in the actual world as its two
          sides, will and idea, has, in order that we might understand each
          of them more clearly in isolation, been dissevered in these two
          books.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It may not
          perhaps be superfluous to elucidate further by an example how the
          law of causality has meaning only in relation to time and space,
          and the matter which consists in the union of the two. For it
          determines the limits in accordance with which the phenomena of the
          forces of nature divide themselves in the possession of matter,
          while the original forces of nature, as the immediate
          objectification of will, which, as a thing in itself, is not
          subordinated to the principle of sufficient reason, lie outside
          these forms, within which alone all etiological explanation has
          validity and meaning, and just on that account can never lead us to
          the inner reality of nature. For this purpose let us think of some
          kind of machine constructed according to the laws of mechanics.
          Iron weights begin the motion by their gravity; copper wheels
          resist by their rigidity, affect and raise each other and the lever
          by their impenetrability, and so on. Here gravity, rigidity, and
          impenetrability are original unexplained forces; mechanics only
          gives us the condition under which, and the manner in which, they
          manifest themselves, appear, and govern a definite matter, time,
          and place. If, now, a strong magnet is made to attract the iron of
          the weight, and overcome its gravity, the movement of the machine
          stops, and the matter becomes forthwith the scene of quite a
          different force of nature—magnetism, of which etiology again gives
          no further explanation than the condition under which it appears.
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page177">[pg 177]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg177"></a> Or let us suppose
          that the copper discs of such a machine are laid upon zinc plates,
          and an acid solution introduced between them. At once the same
          matter of the machine has become subject to another original force,
          galvanism, which now governs it according to its own laws, and
          reveals itself in it through its phenomena; and etiology can again
          tell us nothing about this force except the conditions under which,
          and the laws in accordance with which, it manifests itself. Let us
          now raise the temperature and add pure acid; the whole machine
          burns; that is to say, once more an entirely different force of
          nature, chemical energy, asserts at this time and in this place
          irresistible claims to this particular matter, and reveals itself
          in it as Idea, as a definite grade of the objectification of will.
          The calcined metal thus produced now unites with an acid, and a
          salt is obtained which forms itself into crystals. These are the
          phenomena of another Idea, which in itself is again quite
          inexplicable, while the appearance of its phenomena is dependent
          upon certain conditions which etiology can give us. The crystals
          dissolve, mix with other materials, and vegetation springs up from
          them—a new phenomenon of will: and so the same permanent matter may
          be followed <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ad infinitum</span></span>,
          to observe how now this and now that natural force obtains a right
          to it and temporarily takes possession of it, in order to appear
          and reveal its own nature. The condition of this right, the point
          of time and space at which it becomes valid, is given by causality,
          but the explanation founded upon this law only extends thus far.
          The force itself is a manifestation of will, and as such is not
          subject to the forms of the principle of sufficient reason, that
          is, it is groundless. It lies outside all time, is omnipresent, and
          seems as it were to wait constantly till the circumstances occur
          under which it can appear and take possession of a definite matter,
          supplanting the forces which have reigned in it till then. All time
          exists only for the phenomena of such a force, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page178">[pg 178]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg178"></a> and is without significance for the
          force itself. Through thousands of years chemical forces slumber in
          matter till the contact with the reagents sets them free; then they
          appear; but time exists only for the phenomena, not for the forces
          themselves. For thousands of years galvanism slumbered in copper
          and zinc, and they lay quietly beside silver, which must be
          consumed in flame as soon as all three are brought together under
          the required conditions. Even in the organic kingdom we see a dry
          seed preserve the slumbering force through three thousand years,
          and when at last the favourable circumstances occur, grow up as a
          plant.<a href="#note_35" id="noteref_35" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">35</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If by this
          exposition the difference between a force of nature and all its
          phenomena has been made quite distinct; if we have seen clearly
          that the former is the will itself at this particular grade of its
          objectification, but that multiplicity comes to phenomena only
          through time and space, and that the law of causality is nothing
          but the determination of the position of these phenomena in time
          and space; then we shall recognise the complete truth and the deep
          meaning of Malebranche's doctrine of occasional causes (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">causes occasionelles</span></span>). It is
          well worth <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page179">[pg
          179]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg179"></a>
          while comparing this doctrine of his, as he explains it in the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Recherches de la Vérite</span></span>,”</span>
          both in the 3rd Chapter of the second part of the 6th Book, and in
          the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">éclaircissements</span></span> appended to
          this chapter, with this exposition of mine, and observing the
          complete agreement of the two doctrines in the case of such
          different systems of thought. Indeed I cannot help admiring how
          Malebranche, though thoroughly involved in the positive dogmas
          which his age inevitably forced upon him, yet, in such bonds and
          under such a burden, hit the truth so happily, so correctly, and
          even knew how to combine it with these dogmas, at all events
          verbally.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For the power of
          truth is incredibly great and of unspeakable endurance. We find
          constant traces of it in all, even the most eccentric and absurd
          dogmas, of different times and different lands,—often indeed in
          strange company, curiously mixed up with other things, but still
          recognisable. It is like a plant that germinates under a heap of
          great stones, but still struggles up to the light, working itself
          through with many deviations and windings, disfigured, worn out,
          stunted in its growth,—but yet, to the light.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In any case
          Malebranche is right: every natural cause is only an occasional
          cause. It only gives opportunity or occasion for the manifestation
          of the one indivisible will which is the <span class="tei tei-q">“in-itself”</span> of all things, and whose graduated
          objectification is the whole visible world. Only the appearance,
          the becoming visible, in this place, at this time, is brought about
          by the cause and is so far dependent on it, but not the whole of
          the phenomenon, nor its inner nature. This is the will itself, to
          which the principle of sufficient reason has not application, and
          which is therefore groundless. Nothing in the world has a
          sufficient cause of its existence generally, but only a cause of
          existence just here and just now. That a stone exhibits now
          gravity, now rigidity, now electricity, now chemical qualities,
          depends upon causes, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page180">[pg
          180]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg180"></a>
          upon impressions upon it from without, and is to be explained from
          these. But these qualities themselves, and thus the whole inner
          nature of the stone which consists in them, and therefore manifests
          itself in all the ways referred to; thus, in general, that the
          stone is such as it is, that it exists generally—all this, I say,
          has no ground, but is the visible appearance of the groundless
          will. Every cause is thus an occasional cause. We have found it to
          be so in nature, which is without knowledge, and it is also
          precisely the same when motives and not causes or stimuli determine
          the point at which the phenomena are to appear, that is to say, in
          the actions of animals and human beings. For in both cases it is
          one and the same will which appears; very different in the grades
          of its manifestation, multiplied in the phenomena of these grades,
          and, in respect of these, subordinated to the principle of
          sufficient reason, but in itself free from all this. Motives do not
          determine the character of man, but only the phenomena of his
          character, that is, his actions; the outward fashion of his life,
          not its inner meaning and content. These proceed from the character
          which is the immediate manifestation of the will, and is therefore
          groundless. That one man is bad and another good, does not depend
          upon motives or outward influences, such as teaching and preaching,
          and is in this sense quite inexplicable. But whether a bad man
          shows his badness in petty acts of injustice, cowardly tricks, and
          low knavery which he practises in the narrow sphere of his
          circumstances, or whether as a conqueror he oppresses nations,
          throws a world into lamentation, and sheds the blood of millions;
          this is the outward form of his manifestation, that which is
          unessential to it, and depends upon the circumstances in which fate
          has placed him, upon his surroundings, upon external influences,
          upon motives; but his decision upon these motives can never be
          explained from them; it proceeds from the will, of which this man
          is a manifestation. Of this we shall <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page181">[pg 181]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg181"></a> speak in the Fourth Book. The manner in which
          the character discloses its qualities is quite analogous to the way
          in which those of every material body in unconscious nature are
          disclosed. Water remains water with its intrinsic qualities,
          whether as a still lake it reflects its banks, or leaps in foam
          from the cliffs, or, artificially confined, spouts in a long jet
          into the air. All that depends upon external causes; the one form
          is as natural to it as the other, but it will always show the same
          form in the same circumstances; it is equally ready for any, but in
          every case true to its character, and at all times revealing this
          alone. So will every human character under all circumstances reveal
          itself, but the phenomena which proceed from it will always be in
          accordance with the circumstances.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 27. If, from
          the foregoing consideration of the forces of nature and their
          phenomena, we have come to see clearly how far an explanation from
          causes can go, and where it must stop if it is not to degenerate
          into the vain attempt to reduce the content of all phenomena to
          their mere form, in which case there would ultimately remain
          nothing but form, we shall be able to settle in general terms what
          is to be demanded of etiology as a whole. It must seek out the
          causes of all phenomena in nature, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          the circumstances under which they invariably appear. Then it must
          refer the multitude of phenomena which have various forms in
          various circumstances to what is active in every phenomenon, and is
          presupposed in the cause,—original forces of nature. It must
          correctly distinguish between a difference of the phenomenon which
          arises from a difference of the force, and one which results merely
          from a difference of the circumstances under which the force
          expresses itself; and with equal care it must guard against taking
          the expressions of one and the same force under different
          circumstances for the manifestations of different forces, and
          conversely against taking for manifestations of one <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page182">[pg 182]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg182"></a> and the same force what originally
          belongs to different forces. Now this is the direct work of the
          faculty of judgment, and that is why so few men are capable of
          increasing our insight in physics, while all are able to enlarge
          experience. Indolence and ignorance make us disposed to appeal too
          soon to original forces. This is exemplified with an exaggeration
          that savours of irony in the entities and quidities of the
          schoolmen. Nothing is further from my desire than to favour their
          resuscitation. We have just as little right to appeal to the
          objectification of will, instead of giving a physical explanation,
          as we have to appeal to the creative power of God. For physics
          demands causes, and the will is never a cause. Its whole relation
          to the phenomenon is not in accordance with the principle of
          sufficient reason. But that which in itself is the will exists in
          another aspect as idea; that is to say, is phenomenon. As such, it
          obeys the laws which constitute the form of the phenomenon. Every
          movement, for example, although it is always a manifestation of
          will, must yet have a cause from which it is to be explained in
          relation to a particular time and space; that is, not in general in
          its inner nature, but as a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">particular</span></em> phenomenon. In the case
          of the stone, this is a mechanical cause; in that of the movement
          of a man, it is a motive; but in no case can it be wanting. On the
          other hand, the universal common nature of all phenomena of one
          particular kind, that which must be presupposed if the explanation
          from causes is to have any sense and meaning, is the general force
          of nature, which, in physics, must remain a <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">qualitas occulta</span></span>, because with
          it the etiological explanation ends and the metaphysical begins.
          But the chain of causes and effects is never broken by an original
          force to which it has been necessary to appeal. It does not run
          back to such a force as if it were its first link, but the nearest
          link, as well as the remotest, presupposes the original force, and
          could otherwise explain nothing. A series of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page183">[pg 183]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg183"></a> causes and effects may be the
          manifestation of the most different kinds of forces, whose
          successive visible appearances are conducted through it, as I have
          illustrated above by the example of a metal machine. But the
          difference of these original forces, which cannot be referred to
          each other, by no means breaks the unity of that chain of causes,
          and the connection between all its links. The etiology and the
          philosophy of nature never do violence to each other, but go hand
          in hand, regarding the same object from different points of view.
          Etiology gives an account of the causes which necessarily produce
          the particular phenomenon to be explained. It exhibits, as the
          foundation of all its explanations, the universal forces which are
          active in all these causes and effects. It accurately defines,
          enumerates, and distinguishes these forces, and then indicates all
          the different effects in which each force appears, regulated by the
          difference of the circumstances, always in accordance with its own
          peculiar character, which it discloses in obedience to an
          invariable rule, called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a law of nature</span></em>. When all this has
          been thoroughly accomplished by physics in every particular, it
          will be complete, and its work will be done. There will then remain
          no unknown force in unorganised nature, nor any effect, which has
          not been proved to be the manifestation of one of these forces
          under definite circumstances, in accordance with a law of nature.
          Yet a law of nature remains merely the observed rule according to
          which nature invariably proceeds whenever certain definite
          circumstances occur. Therefore a law of nature may be defined as a
          fact expressed generally—<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">un fait
          généralisé</span></span>—and thus a complete enumeration of all the
          laws of nature would only be a complete register of facts. The
          consideration of nature as a whole is thus completed in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">morphology</span></em>, which enumerates,
          compares, and arranges all the enduring forms of organised nature.
          Of the causes of the appearance of the individual creature it has
          little to say, for in all cases this is procreation (the theory of
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page184">[pg 184]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg184"></a> which is a separate
          matter), and in rare cases the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">generatio æquivoca</span></span>. But to this
          last belongs, strictly speaking, the manner in which all the lower
          grades of the objectification of will, that is to say, physical and
          chemical phenomena, appear as individual, and it is precisely the
          task of etiology to point out the conditions of this appearance.
          Philosophy, on the other hand, concerns itself only with the
          universal, in nature as everywhere else. The original forces
          themselves are here its object, and it recognises in them the
          different grades of the objectivity of will, which is the inner
          nature, the <span class="tei tei-q">“in-itself”</span> of this
          world; and when it regards the world apart from will, it explains
          it as merely the idea of the subject. But if etiology, instead of
          preparing the way for philosophy, and supplying its doctrines with
          practical application by means of instances, supposes that its aim
          is rather to deny the existence of all original forces, except
          perhaps <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em>, the most general, for
          example, impenetrability, which it imagines it thoroughly
          understands, and consequently seeks forcibly to refer all the
          others to it—it forsakes its own province and can only give us
          error instead of truth. The content of nature is supplanted by its
          form, everything is ascribed to the circumstances which work from
          without, and nothing to the inner nature of the thing. Now if it
          were possible to succeed by this method, a problem in arithmetic
          would ultimately, as we have already remarked, solve the riddle of
          the universe. But this is the method adopted by those, referred to
          above, who think that all physiological effects ought to be reduced
          to form and combination, this, perhaps, to electricity, and this
          again to chemism, and chemism to mechanism. The mistake of
          Descartes, for example, and of all the Atomists, was of this last
          description. They referred the movements of the globe to the impact
          of a fluid, and the qualities of matter to the connection and form
          of the atoms, and hence they laboured to explain all the phenomena
          of nature as merely manifestations of impenetrability <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page185">[pg 185]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg185"></a> and cohesion. Although this has been
          given up, precisely the same error is committed in our own day by
          the electrical, chemical, and mechanical physiologists, who
          obstinately attempt to explain the whole of life and all the
          functions of the organism from <span class="tei tei-q">“form and
          combination.”</span> In Meckel's <span class="tei tei-q">“Archiv
          für Physiologie”</span> (1820, vol. v. p. 185) we still find it
          stated that the aim of physiological explanation is the reduction
          of organic life to the universal forces with which physics deals.
          Lamarck also, in his <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Philosophie
          Zoologique</span></span>,”</span> explains life as merely the
          effect of warmth and electricity: <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">le
          calorique et la matière électrique suffisent parfaitement pour
          composer ensemble cette cause essentielle de la vie</span></span>
          (p. 16). According to this, warmth and electricity would be the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“thing-in-itself,”</span> and the world of
          animals and plants its phenomenal appearance. The absurdity of this
          opinion becomes glaringly apparent at the 306th and following pages
          of that work. It is well known that all these opinions, that have
          been so often refuted, have reappeared quite recently with renewed
          confidence. If we carefully examine the foundation of these views,
          we shall find that they ultimately involve the presupposition that
          the organism is merely an aggregate of phenomena of physical,
          chemical, and mechanical forces, which have come together here by
          chance, and produced the organism as a freak of nature without
          further significance. The organism of an animal or of a human being
          would therefore be, if considered philosophically, not the
          exhibition of a special Idea, that is, not itself immediate
          objectivity of the will at a definite higher grade, but in it would
          appear only those Ideas which objectify the will in electricity, in
          chemism, and in mechanism. Thus the organism would be as
          fortuitously constructed by the concurrence of these forces as the
          forms of men and beasts in clouds and stalactites, and would
          therefore in itself be no more interesting than they are. However,
          we shall see immediately how far the application of physical and
          chemical modes of explanation <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page186">[pg 186]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg186"></a> to the organism may yet, within certain
          limits, be allowable and useful; for I shall explain that the vital
          force certainly avails itself of and uses the forces of unorganised
          nature; yet these forces no more constitute the vital force than a
          hammer and anvil make a blacksmith. Therefore even the most simple
          example of plant life can never be explained from these forces by
          any theory of capillary attraction and endosmose, much less animal
          life. The following observations will prepare the way for this
          somewhat difficult discussion.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It follows from
          all that has been said that it is certainly an error on the part of
          natural science to seek to refer the higher grades of the
          objectification of will to the lower; for the failure to recognise,
          or the denial of, original and self-existing forces of nature is
          just as wrong as the groundless assumption of special forces when
          what occurs is merely a peculiar kind of manifestation of what is
          already known. Thus Kant rightly says that it would be absurd to
          hope for a blade of grass from a Newton, that is, from one who
          reduced the blade of grass to the manifestations of physical and
          chemical forces, of which it was the chance product, and therefore
          a mere freak of nature, in which no special Idea appeared,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the will did not directly
          reveal itself in it in a higher and specific grade, but just as in
          the phenomena of unorganised nature and by chance in this form. The
          schoolmen, who certainly would not have allowed such a doctrine,
          would rightly have said that it was a complete denial of the
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">forma substantialis</span></span>, and a
          degradation of it to the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">forma
          accidentalis</span></span>. For the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">forma substantialis</span></span> of Aristotle
          denotes exactly what I call the grade of the objectification of
          will in a thing. On the other hand, it is not to be overlooked that
          in all Ideas, that is, in all forces of unorganised, and all forms
          of organised nature, it is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one and the same</span></em> will that reveals
          itself, that is to say, which enters the form of the idea and
          passes into <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">objectivity</span></em>. Its unity must
          therefore be also recognisable <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page187">[pg 187]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg187"></a> through an inner relationship between all its
          phenomena. Now this reveals itself in the higher grades of the
          objectification of will, where the whole phenomenon is more
          distinct, thus in the vegetable and animal kingdoms, through the
          universally prevailing analogy of all forms, the fundamental type
          which recurs in all phenomena. This has, therefore, become the
          guiding principle of the admirable zoological system which was
          originated by the French in this century, and it is most completely
          established in comparative anatomy as <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">l'unité de plan</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">l'uniformité de l'élément
          anatomique</span></span>. To discover this fundamental type has
          been the chief concern, or at any rate the praiseworthy endeavour,
          of the natural philosophers of the school of Schelling, who have in
          this respect considerable merit, although in many cases their hunt
          after analogies in nature degenerated into mere conceits. They
          have, however, rightly shown that that general relationship and
          family likeness exists also in the Ideas of unorganised nature; for
          example, between electricity and magnetism, the identity of which
          was afterwards established; between chemical attraction and
          gravitation, and so forth. They specially called attention to the
          fact that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">polarity</span></em>, that is, the sundering
          of a force into two qualitatively different and opposed activities
          striving after reunion, which also shows itself for the most part
          in space as a dispersion in opposite directions, is a fundamental
          type of almost all the phenomena of nature, from the magnet and the
          crystal to man himself. Yet this knowledge has been current in
          China from the earliest times, in the doctrine of opposition of Yin
          and Yang. Indeed, since all things in the world are the
          objectification of one and the same will, and therefore in their
          inner nature identical, it must not only be the case that there is
          that unmistakable analogy between them, and that in every
          phenomenon the trace, intimation, and plan of the higher phenomenon
          that lies next to it in point of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page188">[pg 188]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg188"></a> development shows itself, but also because
          all these forms belong to the world as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">idea</span></em>,
          it is indeed conceivable that even in the most universal forms of
          the idea, in that peculiar framework of the phenomenal world space
          and time, it may be possible to discern and establish the
          fundamental type, intimation, and plan of what fills the forms. It
          seems to have been a dim notion of this that was the origin of the
          Cabala and all the mathematical philosophy of the Pythagoreans, and
          also of the Chinese in Y-king. In the school of Schelling also, to
          which we have already referred, we find, among their efforts to
          bring to light the similarity among the phenomena of nature,
          several attempts (though rather unfortunate ones) to deduce laws of
          nature from the laws of pure space and time. However, one can never
          tell to what extent a man of genius will realise both
          endeavours.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now, although
          the difference between phenomenon and thing-in-itself is never lost
          sight of, and therefore the identity of the will which objectifies
          itself in all Ideas can never (because it has different grades of
          its objectification) be distorted to mean identity of the
          particular Ideas themselves in which it appears, so that, for
          example, chemical or electrical attraction can never be reduced to
          the attraction of gravitation, although this inner analogy is
          known, and the former may be regarded as, so to speak, higher
          powers of the latter, just as little does the similarity of the
          construction of all animals warrant us in mixing and identifying
          the species and explaining the more developed as mere variations of
          the less developed; and although, finally, the physiological
          functions are never to be reduced to chemical or physical
          processes, yet, in justification of this procedure, within certain
          limits, we may accept the following observations as highly
          probable.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If several of
          the phenomena of will in the lower grades of its
          objectification—that is, in unorganised nature—come into conflict
          because each of them, under the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page189">[pg 189]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg189"></a> guidance of causality, seeks to possess a
          given portion of matter, there arises from the conflict the
          phenomenon of a higher Idea which prevails over all the less
          developed phenomena previously there, yet in such a way that it
          allows the essence of these to continue to exist in a subordinate
          manner, in that it takes up into itself from them something which
          is analogous to them. This process is only intelligible from the
          identity of the will which manifests itself in all the Ideas, and
          which is always striving after higher objectification. We thus see,
          for example, in the hardening of the bones, an unmistakable analogy
          to crystallisation, as the force which originally had possession of
          the chalk, although ossification is never to be reduced to
          crystallisation. The analogy shows itself in a weaker degree in the
          flesh becoming firm. The combination of humours in the animal body
          and secretion are also analogous to chemical combination and
          separation. Indeed, the laws of chemistry are still strongly
          operative in this case, but subordinated, very much modified, and
          mastered by a higher Idea; therefore mere chemical forces outside
          the organism will never afford us such humours; but</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The more
          developed Idea resulting from this victory over several lower Ideas
          or objectifications of will, gains an entirely new character by
          taking up into itself from every Idea over which it has prevailed a
          strengthened analogy. The will objectifies itself in a new, more
          distinct way. It originally appears in <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">generatio æquivoca</span></span>; afterwards
          in assimilation to the given germ, organic moisture, plant, animal,
          man. Thus from the strife of lower phenomena the higher arise,
          swallowing them all up, but yet realising in the higher grade the
          tendency of all the lower. Here, then, already the law
          applies—<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Serpens nisi serpentem
          comederit non fit draco.</span></span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page190">[pg 190]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg190"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I wish it had
          been possible for me to dispel by clearness of explanation the
          obscurity which clings to the subject of these thoughts; but I see
          very well that the reader's own consideration of the matter must
          materially aid me if I am not to remain uncomprehended or
          misunderstood. According to the view I have expressed, the traces
          of chemical and physical modes of operation will indeed be found in
          the organism, but it can never be explained from them; because it
          is by no means a phenomenon even accidentally brought about through
          the united actions of such forces, but a higher Idea which has
          overcome these lower ideas by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">subduing assimilation</span></em>; for the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> will which objectifies itself
          in all Ideas always seeks the highest possible objectification, and
          has therefore in this case given up the lower grades of its
          manifestation after a conflict, in order to appear in a higher
          grade, and one so much the more powerful. No victory without
          conflict: since the higher Idea or objectification of will can only
          appear through the conquest of the lower, it endures the opposition
          of these lower Ideas, which, although brought into subjection,
          still constantly strive to obtain an independent and complete
          expression of their being. The magnet that has attracted a piece of
          iron carries on a perpetual conflict with gravitation, which, as
          the lower objectification of will, has a prior right to the matter
          of the iron; and in this constant battle the magnet indeed grows
          stronger, for the opposition excites it, as it were, to greater
          effort. In the same way every manifestation of the will, including
          that which expresses itself in the human organism, wages a constant
          war against the many physical and chemical forces which, as lower
          Ideas, have a prior right to that matter. Thus the arm falls which
          for a while, overcoming gravity, we have held stretched out; thus
          the pleasing sensation of health, which proclaims the victory of
          the Idea of the self-conscious organism over the physical and
          chemical laws, which originally governed the humours of
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page191">[pg 191]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg191"></a> the body, is so
          often interrupted, and is indeed always accompanied by greater or
          less discomfort, which arises from the resistance of these forces,
          and on account of which the vegetative part of our life is
          constantly attended by slight pain. Thus also digestion weakens all
          the animal functions, because it requires the whole vital force to
          overcome the chemical forces of nature by assimilation. Hence also
          in general the burden of physical life, the necessity of sleep,
          and, finally, of death; for at last these subdued forces of nature,
          assisted by circumstances, win back from the organism, wearied even
          by the constant victory, the matter it took from them, and attain
          to an unimpeded expression of their being. We may therefore say
          that every organism expresses the Idea of which it is the image,
          only after we have subtracted the part of its force which is
          expended in subduing the lower Ideas that strive with it for
          matter. This seems to have been running in the mind of Jacob Böhm
          when he says somewhere that all the bodies of men and animals, and
          even all plants, are really half dead. According as the subjection
          in the organism of these forces of nature, which express the lower
          grades of the objectification of will, is more or less successful,
          the more or the less completely does it attain to the expression of
          its Idea; that is to say, the nearer it is to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ideal</span></em>
          or the further from it—the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ideal</span></em> of beauty in its
          species.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus everywhere
          in nature we see strife, conflict, and alternation of victory, and
          in it we shall come to recognise more distinctly that variance with
          itself which is essential to the will. Every grade of the
          objectification of will fights for the matter, the space, and the
          time of the others. The permanent matter must constantly change its
          form; for under the guidance of causality, mechanical, physical,
          chemical, and organic phenomena, eagerly striving to appear, wrest
          the matter from each other, for each desires to reveal its own
          Idea. This strife may be followed through the whole of nature;
          indeed nature exists only through it: <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page192">[pg 192]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg192"></a> ει γαρ μη ην το νεικος εν τοις πραγμασιν, ἑν
          αν ην ἁπαντα, ὡς φησιν Εμπεδοκλης; (nam si non inesset in rebus
          contentio, unum omnia essent, ut ait Empedocles. Aris. Metaph., B.
          5). Yet this strife itself is only the revelation of that variance
          with itself which is essential to the will. This universal conflict
          becomes most distinctly visible in the animal kingdom. For animals
          have the whole of the vegetable kingdom for their food, and even
          within the animal kingdom every beast is the prey and the food of
          another; that is, the matter in which its Idea expresses itself
          must yield itself to the expression of another Idea, for each
          animal can only maintain its existence by the constant destruction
          of some other. Thus the will to live everywhere preys upon itself,
          and in different forms is its own nourishment, till finally the
          human race, because it subdues all the others, regards nature as a
          manufactory for its use. Yet even the human race, as we shall see
          in the Fourth Book, reveals in itself with most terrible
          distinctness this conflict, this variance with itself of the will,
          and we find <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">homo homini
          lupus</span></span>. Meanwhile we can recognise this strife, this
          subjugation, just as well in the lower grades of the
          objectification of will. Many insects (especially ichneumon-flies)
          lay their eggs on the skin, and even in the body of the larvæ of
          other insects, whose slow destruction is the first work of the
          newly hatched brood. The young hydra, which grows like a bud out of
          the old one, and afterwards separates itself from it, fights while
          it is still joined to the old one for the prey that offers itself,
          so that the one snatches it out of the mouth of the other
          (Trembley, Polypod., ii. p. 110, and iii. p. 165). But the
          bulldog-ant of Australia affords us the most extraordinary example
          of this kind; for if it is cut in two, a battle begins between the
          head and the tail. The head seizes the tail with its teeth, and the
          tail defends itself bravely by stinging the head: the battle may
          last for half an hour, until they die or are dragged away by other
          ants. This contest takes place <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page193">[pg 193]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg193"></a> every time the experiment is tried. (From a
          letter by Howitt in the W. Journal, reprinted in Galignani's
          Messenger, 17th November 1855.) On the banks of the Missouri one
          sometimes sees a mighty oak the stem and branches of which are so
          encircled, fettered, and interlaced by a gigantic wild vine, that
          it withers as if choked. The same thing shows itself in the lowest
          grades; for example, when water and carbon are changed into
          vegetable sap, or vegetables or bread into blood by organic
          assimilation; and so also in every case in which animal secretion
          takes place, along with the restriction of chemical forces to a
          subordinate mode of activity. This also occurs in unorganised
          nature, when, for example, crystals in process of formation meet,
          cross, and mutually disturb each other to such an extent that they
          are unable to assume the pure crystalline form, so that almost
          every cluster of crystals is an image of such a conflict of will at
          this low grade of its objectification; or again, when a magnet
          forces its magnetism upon iron, in order to express its Idea in it;
          or when galvanism overcomes chemical affinity, decomposes the
          closest combinations, and so entirely suspends the laws of
          chemistry that the acid of a decomposed salt at the negative pole
          must pass to the positive pole without combining with the alkalies
          through which it goes on its way, or turning red the litmus paper
          that touches it. On a large scale it shows itself in the relation
          between the central body and the planet, for although the planet is
          in absolute dependence, yet it always resists, just like the
          chemical forces in the organism; hence arises the constant tension
          between centripetal and centrifugal force, which keeps the globe in
          motion, and is itself an example of that universal essential
          conflict of the manifestation of will which we are considering. For
          as every body must be regarded as the manifestation of a will, and
          as will necessarily expresses itself as a struggle, the original
          condition of every world that is formed into a globe cannot be
          rest, but motion, a striving forward in boundless space
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page194">[pg 194]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg194"></a> without rest and
          without end. Neither the law of inertia nor that of causality is
          opposed to this: for as, according to the former, matter as such is
          alike indifferent to rest and motion, its original condition may
          just as well be the one as the other, therefore if we first find it
          in motion, we have just as little right to assume that this was
          preceded by a condition of rest, and to inquire into the cause of
          the origin of the motion, as, conversely, if we found it at rest,
          we would have to assume a previous motion and inquire into the
          cause of its suspension. It is, therefore, not needful to seek for
          a first impulse for centrifugal force, for, according to the
          hypothesis of Kant and Laplace, it is, in the case of the planets,
          the residue of the original rotation of the central body, from
          which the planets have separated themselves as it contracted. But
          to this central body itself motion is essential; it always
          continues its rotation, and at the same time rushes forward in
          endless space, or perhaps circulates round a greater central body
          invisible to us. This view entirely agrees with the conjecture of
          astronomers that there is a central sun, and also with the observed
          advance of our whole solar system, and perhaps of the whole stellar
          system to which our sun belongs. From this we are finally led to
          assume a general advance of fixed stars, together with the central
          sun, and this certainly loses all meaning in boundless space (for
          motion in absolute space cannot be distinguished from rest), and
          becomes, as is already the case from its striving and aimless
          flight, an expression of that nothingness, that failure of all aim,
          which, at the close of this book, we shall be obliged to recognise
          in the striving of will in all its phenomena. Thus boundless space
          and endless time must be the most universal and essential forms of
          the collective phenomena of will, which exist for the expression of
          its whole being. Lastly, we can recognise that conflict which we
          are considering of all phenomena of will against each other in
          simple matter regarded as such; for the real characteristic
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page195">[pg 195]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg195"></a> of matter is
          correctly expressed by Kant as repulsive and attractive force; so
          that even crude matter has its existence only in the strife of
          conflicting forces. If we abstract from all chemical differences in
          matter, or go so far back in the chain of causes and effects that
          as yet there is no chemical difference, there remains mere
          matter,—the world rounded to a globe, whose life, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          objectification of will, is now constituted by the conflict between
          attractive and repulsive forces, the former as gravitation pressing
          from all sides towards the centre, the latter as impenetrability
          always opposing the former either as rigidity or elasticity; and
          this constant pressure and resistance may be regarded as the
          objectivity of will in its very lowest grade, and even there it
          expresses its character.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We should see
          the will express itself here in the lowest grade as blind striving,
          an obscure, inarticulate impulse, far from susceptible of being
          directly known. It is the simplest and the weakest mode of its
          objectification. But it appears as this blind and unconscious
          striving in the whole of unorganised nature, in all those original
          forces of which it is the work of physics and chemistry to discover
          and to study the laws, and each of which manifests itself to us in
          millions of phenomena which are exactly similar and regular, and
          show no trace of individual character, but are mere multiplicity
          through space and time, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, through the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium individuationis</span></span>, as a
          picture is multiplied through the facets of a glass.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From grade to
          grade objectifying itself more distinctly, yet still completely
          without consciousness as an obscure striving force, the will acts
          in the vegetable kingdom also, in which the bond of its phenomena
          consists no longer properly of causes, but of stimuli; and,
          finally, also in the vegetative part of the animal phenomenon, in
          the production and maturing of the animal, and in sustaining its
          inner economy, in which the manifestation of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page196">[pg 196]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg196"></a> will is still always necessarily
          determined by stimuli. The ever-ascending grades of the
          objectification of will bring us at last to the point at which the
          individual that expresses the Idea could no longer receive food for
          its assimilation through mere movement following upon stimuli. For
          such a stimulus must be waited for, but the food has now come to be
          of a more special and definite kind, and with the ever-increasing
          multiplicity of the individual phenomena, the crowd and confusion
          has become so great that they interfere with each other, and the
          chance of the individual that is moved merely by stimuli and must
          wait for its food would be too unfavourable. From the point,
          therefore, at which the animal has delivered itself from the egg or
          the womb in which it vegetated without consciousness, its food must
          be sought out and selected. For this purpose movement following
          upon motives, and therefore consciousness, becomes necessary, and
          consequently it appears as an agent, μηχανη, called in at this
          stage of the objectification of will for the conservation of the
          individual and the propagation of the species. It appears
          represented by the brain or a large ganglion, just as every other
          effort or determination of the will which objectifies itself is
          represented by an organ, that is to say, manifests itself for the
          idea as an organ.<a href="#note_36" id="noteref_36" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">36</span></span></a> But
          with this means of assistance, this μηχανη, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">world as
          idea</span></em> comes into existence at a stroke, with all its
          forms, object and subject, time, space, multiplicity, and
          causality. The world now shows its second side. Till now <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mere
          will</span></em>, it becomes also <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">idea</span></em>,
          object of the knowing subject. The will, which up to this point
          followed its tendency in the dark with unerring certainty, has at
          this grade kindled for itself a light as a means which became
          necessary for getting rid of the disadvantage which arose from the
          throng and the complicated <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page197">[pg 197]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg197"></a> nature of its manifestations, and which would
          have accrued precisely to the most perfect of them. The hitherto
          infallible certainty and regularity with which it worked in
          unorganised and merely vegetative nature, rested upon the fact that
          it alone was active in its original nature, as blind impulse, will,
          without assistance, and also without interruption, from a second
          and entirely different world, the world as idea, which is indeed
          only the image of its own inner being, but is yet of quite another
          nature, and now encroaches on the connected whole of its phenomena.
          Hence its infallible certainty comes to an end. Animals are already
          exposed to illusion, to deception. They have, however, merely ideas
          of perception, no conceptions, no reflection, and they are
          therefore bound to the present; they cannot have regard for the
          future. It seems as if this knowledge without reason was not in all
          cases sufficient for its end, and at times required, as it were,
          some assistance. For the very remarkable phenomenon presents
          itself, that the blind working of the will and the activity
          enlightened by knowledge encroach in a most astonishing manner upon
          each other's spheres in two kinds of phenomena. In the one case we
          find in the very midst of those actions of animals which are guided
          by perceptive knowledge and its motives one kind of action which is
          accomplished apart from these, and thus through the necessity of
          the blindly acting will. I refer to those mechanical instincts
          which are guided by no motive or knowledge, and which yet have the
          appearance of performing their work from abstract rational motives.
          The other case, which is opposed to this, is that in which, on the
          contrary, the light of knowledge penetrates into the workshop of
          the blindly active will, and illuminates the vegetative functions
          of the human organism. I mean clairvoyance. Finally, when the will
          has attained to the highest grade of its objectification, that
          knowledge of the understanding given to brutes to which the senses
          supply the data, out of which there arises mere perception confined
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page198">[pg 198]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg198"></a> to what is
          immediately present, does not suffice. That complicated,
          many-sided, imaginative being, man, with his many needs, and
          exposed as he is to innumerable dangers, must, in order to exist,
          be lighted by a double knowledge; a higher power, as it were, of
          perceptive knowledge must be given him, and also reason, as the
          faculty of framing abstract conceptions. With this there has
          appeared reflection, surveying the future and the past, and, as a
          consequence, deliberation, care, the power of premeditated action
          independent of the present, and finally, the full and distinct
          consciousness of one's own deliberate volition as such. Now if with
          mere knowledge of perception there arose the possibility of
          illusion and deception, by which the previous infallibility of the
          blind striving of will was done away with, so that mechanical and
          other instincts, as expressions of unconscious will, had to lend
          their help in the midst of those that were conscious, with the
          entrance of reason that certainty and infallibility of the
          expressions of will (which at the other extreme in unorganised
          nature appeared as strict conformity to law) is almost entirely
          lost; instinct disappears altogether; deliberation, which is
          supposed to take the place of everything else, begets (as was shown
          in the First Book) irresolution and uncertainty; then error becomes
          possible, and in many cases obstructs the adequate objectification
          of the will in action. For although in the character the will has
          already taken its definite and unchangeable bent or direction, in
          accordance with which volition, when occasioned by the presence of
          a motive, invariably takes place, yet error can falsify its
          expressions, for it introduces illusive motives that take the place
          of the real ones which they resemble;<a href="#note_37" id="noteref_37" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">37</span></span></a> as,
          for example, when superstition forces on a man imaginary motives
          which impel him to a course of action directly opposed <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page199">[pg 199]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg199"></a> to the way in which the will would
          otherwise express itself in the given circumstances. Agamemnon
          slays his daughter; a miser dispenses alms, out of pure egotism, in
          the hope that he will some day receive an hundred-fold; and so
          on.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus knowledge
          generally, rational as well as merely sensuous, proceeds originally
          from the will itself, belongs to the inner being of the higher
          grades of its objectification as a mere μηχανη, a means of
          supporting the individual and the species, just like any organ of
          the body. Originally destined for the service of the will for the
          accomplishment of its aims, it remains almost throughout entirely
          subjected to its service: it is so in all brutes and in almost all
          men. Yet we shall see in the Third Book how in certain individual
          men knowledge can deliver itself from this bondage, throw off its
          yoke, and, free from all the aims of will, exist purely for itself,
          simply as a clear mirror of the world, which is the source of art.
          Finally, in the Fourth Book, we shall see how, if this kind of
          knowledge reacts on the will, it can bring about self-surrender,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, resignation, which is the
          final goal, and indeed the inmost nature of all virtue and
          holiness, and is deliverance from the world.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 28. We have
          considered the great multiplicity and diversity of the phenomena in
          which the will objectifies itself, and we have seen their endless
          and implacable strife with each other. Yet, according to the whole
          discussion up to this point, the will itself, as thing-in-itself,
          is by no means included in that multiplicity and change. The
          diversity of the (Platonic) Ideas, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          grades of objectification, the multitude of individuals in which
          each of these expresses itself, the struggle of forms for
          matter,—all this does not concern it, but is only the manner of its
          objectification, and only through this has an indirect relation to
          it, by virtue of which it belongs to the expression of the nature
          of will for the idea. As the magic-lantern shows many different
          pictures, which <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page200">[pg
          200]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg200"></a>
          are all made visible by one and the same light, so in all the
          multifarious phenomena which fill the world together or throng
          after each other as events, only <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one
          will</span></em> manifests itself, of which everything is the
          visibility, the objectivity, and which remains unmoved in the midst
          of this change; it alone is thing-in-itself; all objects are
          manifestations, or, to speak the language of Kant, phenomena.
          Although in man, as (Platonic) Idea, the will finds its clearest
          and fullest objectification, yet man alone could not express its
          being. In order to manifest the full significance of the will, the
          Idea of man would need to appear, not alone and sundered from
          everything else, but accompanied by the whole series of grades,
          down through all the forms of animals, through the vegetable
          kingdom to unorganised nature. All these supplement each other in
          the complete objectification of will; they are as much presupposed
          by the Idea of man as the blossoms of a tree presuppose leaves,
          branches, stem, and root; they form a pyramid, of which man is the
          apex. If fond of similes, one might also say that their
          manifestations accompany that of man as necessarily as the full
          daylight is accompanied by all the gradations of twilight, through
          which, little by little, it loses itself in darkness; or one might
          call them the echo of man, and say: Animal and plant are the
          descending fifth and third of man, the inorganic kingdom is the
          lower octave. The full truth of this last comparison will only
          become clear to us when, in the following book, we attempt to
          fathom the deep significance of music, and see how a connected,
          progressive melody, made up of high, quick notes, may be regarded
          as in some sense expressing the life and efforts of man connected
          by reflection, while the unconnected complemental notes and the
          slow bass, which make up the harmony necessary to perfect the
          music, represent the rest of the animal kingdom and the whole of
          nature that is without knowledge. But of this in its own place,
          where it will not sound so paradoxical. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page201">[pg 201]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg201"></a> We find, however, that the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">inner
          necessity</span></em> of the gradation of its manifestations, which
          is inseparable from the adequate objectification of the will, is
          expressed by an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">outer necessity</span></em> in the whole of
          these manifestations themselves, by reason of which man has need of
          the beasts for his support, the beasts in their grades have need of
          each other as well as of plants, which in their turn require the
          ground, water, chemical elements and their combinations, the
          planet, the sun, rotation and motion round the sun, the curve of
          the ellipse, &amp;c., &amp;c. At bottom this results from the fact
          that the will must live on itself, for there exists nothing beside
          it, and it is a hungry will. Hence arise eager pursuit, anxiety,
          and suffering.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is only the
          knowledge of the unity of will as thing-in-itself, in the endless
          diversity and multiplicity of the phenomena, that can afford us the
          true explanation of that wonderful, unmistakable analogy of all the
          productions of nature, that family likeness on account of which we
          may regard them as variations on the same ungiven theme. So in like
          measure, through the distinct and thoroughly comprehended knowledge
          of that harmony, that essential connection of all the parts of the
          world, that necessity of their gradation which we have just been
          considering, we shall obtain a true and sufficient insight into the
          inner nature and meaning of the undeniable <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">teleology</span></em> of all organised
          productions of nature, which, indeed, we presupposed <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span>, when considering and
          investigating them.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">teleology</span></em> is of a twofold
          description; sometimes an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">inner teleology</span></em>, that is, an
          agreement of all the parts of a particular organism, so ordered
          that the sustenance of the individual and the species results from
          it, and therefore presents itself as the end of that disposition or
          arrangement. Sometimes, however, there is an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">outward
          teleology</span></em>, a relation of unorganised to organised
          nature in general, or of particular parts of organised nature to
          each <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page202">[pg 202]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg202"></a> other, which makes
          the maintenance of the whole of organised nature, or of the
          particular animal species, possible, and therefore presents itself
          to our judgment as the means to this end.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Inner
          teleology</span></em> is connected with the scheme of our work in
          the following way. If, in accordance with what has been said, all
          variations of form in nature, and all multiplicity of individuals,
          belong not to the will itself, but merely to its objectivity and
          the form of this objectivity, it necessarily follows that the will
          is indivisible and is present as a whole in every manifestation,
          although the grades of its objectification, the (Platonic) Ideas,
          are very different from each other. We may, for the sake of
          simplicity, regard these different Ideas as in themselves
          individual and simple acts of the will, in which it expresses its
          nature more or less. Individuals, however, are again manifestations
          of the Ideas, thus of these acts, in time, space, and multiplicity.
          Now, in the lowest grades of objectivity, such an act (or an Idea)
          retains its unity in the manifestation; while, in order to appear
          in higher grades, it requires a whole series of conditions and
          developments in time, which only collectively express its nature
          completely. Thus, for example the Idea that reveals itself in any
          general force of nature has always one single expression, although
          it presents itself differently according to the external relations
          that are present: otherwise its identity could not be proved, for
          this is done by abstracting the diversity that arises merely from
          external relations. In the same way the crystal has only <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em>
          manifestation of life, crystallisation, which afterwards has its
          fully adequate and exhaustive expression in the rigid form, the
          corpse of that momentary life. The plant, however, does not express
          the Idea, whose phenomenon it is, at once and through a single
          manifestation, but in a succession of developments of its organs in
          time. The animal not only develops its organism in the same manner,
          in a succession of forms which are often very different
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page203">[pg 203]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg203"></a> (metamorphosis), but
          this form itself, although it is already objectivity of will at
          this grade, does not attain to a full expression of its Idea. This
          expression must be completed through the actions of the animal, in
          which its empirical character, common to the whole species,
          manifests itself, and only then does it become the full revelation
          of the Idea, a revelation which presupposes the particular organism
          as its first condition. In the case of man, the empirical character
          is peculiar to every individual (indeed, as we shall see in the
          Fourth Book, even to the extent of supplanting entirely the
          character of the species, through the self-surrender of the whole
          will). That which is known as the empirical character, through the
          necessary development in time, and the division into particular
          actions that is conditioned by it, is, when we abstract from this
          temporal form of the manifestation the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intelligible
          character</span></em>, according to the expression of Kant, who
          shows his undying merit especially in establishing this distinction
          and explaining the relation between freedom and necessity,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, between the will as
          thing-in-itself and its manifestations in time.<a href="#note_38" id="noteref_38" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">38</span></span></a> Thus
          the intelligible character coincides with the Idea, or, more
          accurately, with the original act of will which reveals itself in
          it. So far then, not only the empirical character of every man, but
          also that of every species of animal and plant, and even of every
          original force of unorganised nature, is to be regarded as the
          manifestation of an intelligible character, that is, of a timeless,
          indivisible act of will. I should like here to draw attention in
          passing to the naïveté with which every plant expresses and lays
          open its whole character in its mere form, reveals its whole being
          and will. This is <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page204">[pg
          204]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg204"></a>
          why the physiognomy of plants is so interesting; while in order to
          know an animal in its Idea, it is necessary to observe the course
          of its action. As for man, he must be fully investigated and
          tested, for reason makes him capable of a high degree of
          dissimulation. The beast is as much more naïve than the man as the
          plant is more naïve than the beast. In the beast we see the will to
          live more naked, as it were, than in the man, in whom it is clothed
          with so much knowledge, and is, moreover, so veiled through the
          capacity for dissimulation, that it is almost only by chance, and
          here and there, that its true nature becomes apparent. In the plant
          it shows itself quite naked, but also much weaker, as mere blind
          striving for existence without end or aim. For the plant reveals
          its whole being at the first glance, and with complete innocence,
          which does not suffer from the fact that it carries its organs of
          generation exposed to view on its upper surface, though in all
          animals they have been assigned to the most hidden part. This
          innocence of the plant results from its complete want of knowledge.
          Guilt does not lie in willing, but in willing with knowledge. Every
          plant speaks to us first of all of its home, of the climate, and
          the nature of the ground in which it has grown. Therefore, even
          those who have had little practice easily tell whether an exotic
          plant belongs to the tropical or the temperate zone, and whether it
          grows in water, in marshes, on mountain, or on moorland. Besides
          this, however, every plant expresses the special will of its
          species, and says something that cannot be uttered in any other
          tongue. But we must now apply what has been said to the
          teleological consideration of the organism, so far as it concerns
          its inner design. If in unorganised nature the Idea, which is
          everywhere to be regarded as a single act of will, reveals itself
          also in a single manifestation which is always the same, and thus
          one may say that here the empirical character directly partakes of
          the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page205">[pg 205]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg205"></a> unity of the
          intelligible, coincides, as it were, with it, so that no inner
          design can show itself here; if, on the contrary, all organisms
          express their Ideas through a series of successive developments,
          conditioned by a multiplicity of co-existing parts, and thus only
          the sum of the manifestations of the empirical character
          collectively constitute the expression of the intelligible
          character; this necessary co-existence of the parts and succession
          of the stages of development does not destroy the unity of the
          appearing Idea, the act of will which expresses itself; nay, rather
          this unity finds its expression in the necessary relation and
          connection of the parts and stages of development with each other,
          in accordance with the law of causality. Since it is the will which
          is one, indivisible, and therefore entirely in harmony with itself,
          that reveals itself in the whole Idea as in act, its manifestation,
          although broken up into a number of different parts and conditions,
          must yet show this unity again in the thorough agreement of all of
          these. This is effected by a necessary relation and dependence of
          all the parts upon each other, by means of which the unity of the
          Idea is re-established in the manifestation. In accordance with
          this, we now recognise these different parts and functions of the
          organism as related to each other reciprocally as means and end,
          but the organism itself as the final end of all. Consequently,
          neither the breaking up of the Idea, which in itself is simple,
          into the multiplicity of the parts and conditions of the organism,
          on the one hand, nor, on the other hand, the re-establishment of
          its unity through the necessary connection of the parts and
          functions which arises from the fact that they are the cause and
          effect, the means and end, of each other, is peculiar and essential
          to the appearing will as such, to the thing-in-itself, but only to
          its manifestation in space, time, and causality (mere modes of the
          principle of sufficient reason, the form of the phenomenon). They
          belong to the world as <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page206">[pg
          206]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg206"></a>
          idea, not to the world as will; they belong to the way in which the
          will becomes object, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, idea at this grade of its
          objectivity. Every one who has grasped the meaning of this
          discussion—a discussion which is perhaps somewhat difficult—will
          now fully understand the doctrine of Kant, which follows from it,
          that both the design of organised and the conformity to law of
          unorganised nature are only introduced by our understanding, and
          therefore both belong only to the phenomenon, not to the
          thing-in-itself. The surprise, which was referred to above, at the
          infallible constancy of the conformity to law of unorganised
          nature, is essentially the same as the surprise that is excited by
          design in organised nature; for in both cases what we wonder at is
          only the sight of the original unity of the Idea, which, for the
          phenomenon, has assumed the form of multiplicity and
          diversity.<a href="#note_39" id="noteref_39" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">39</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As regards the
          second kind of teleology, according to the division made above, the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">outer</span></em> design, which shows itself,
          not in the inner economy of the organisms, but in the support and
          assistance they receive from without, both from unorganised nature
          and from each other; its general explanation is to be found in the
          exposition we have just given. For the whole world, with all its
          phenomena, is the objectivity of the one indivisible will, the
          Idea, which is related to all other Ideas as harmony is related to
          the single voice. Therefore that unity of the will must show itself
          also in the agreement of all its manifestations. But we can very
          much increase the clearness of this insight if we go somewhat more
          closely into the manifestations of that outer teleology and
          agreement of the different parts of nature with each other, an
          inquiry which will also throw some light on the foregoing
          exposition. We shall best attain this end by considering the
          following analogy.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The character of
          each individual man, so far as it is <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page207">[pg 207]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg207"></a> thoroughly individual, and not entirely
          included in that of the species, may be regarded as a special Idea,
          corresponding to a special act of the objectification of will. This
          act itself would then be his intelligible character, and his
          empirical character would be the manifestation of it. The empirical
          character is entirely determined through the intelligible, which is
          without ground, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, as thing-in-itself is not
          subordinated to the principle of sufficient reason (the form of the
          phenomenon). The empirical character must in the course of life
          afford us the express image of the intelligible, and can only
          become what the nature of the latter demands. But this property
          extends only to the essential, not to the unessential in the course
          of life to which it applies. To this unessential belong the
          detailed events and actions which are the material in which the
          empirical character shows itself. These are determined by outward
          circumstances, which present the motives upon which the character
          reacts according to its nature; and as they may be very different,
          the outward form of the manifestation of the empirical character,
          that is, the definite actual or historical form of the course of
          life, will have to accommodate itself to their influence. Now this
          form may be very different, although what is essential to the
          manifestation, its content, remains the same. Thus, for example it
          is immaterial whether a man plays for nuts or for crowns; but
          whether a man cheats or plays fairly, that is the real matter; the
          latter is determined by the intelligible character, the former by
          outward circumstances. As the same theme may be expressed in a
          hundred different variations, so the same character may be
          expressed in a hundred very different lives. But various as the
          outward influence may be, the empirical character which expresses
          itself in the course of life must yet, whatever form it takes,
          accurately objectify the intelligible character, for the latter
          adapts its objectification to the given material of actual
          circumstances. We have now to assume something analogous to the
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page208">[pg 208]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg208"></a> influence of outward
          circumstances upon the life that is determined in essential matters
          by the character, if we desire to understand how the will, in the
          original act of its objectification, determines the various Ideas
          in which it objectifies itself, that is, the different forms of
          natural existence of every kind, among which it distributes its
          objectification, and which must therefore necessarily have a
          relation to each other in the manifestation. We must assume that
          between all these manifestations of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em>
          will there existed a universal and reciprocal adaptation and
          accommodation of themselves to each other, by which, however, as we
          shall soon see more clearly, all time-determination is to be
          excluded, for the Idea lies outside time. In accordance with this,
          every manifestation must have adapted itself to the surroundings
          into which it entered, and these again must have adapted themselves
          to it, although it occupied a much later position in time; and we
          see this <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">consensus
          naturæ</span></span> everywhere. Every plant is therefore adapted
          to its soil and climate, every animal to its element and the prey
          that will be its food, and is also in some way protected, to a
          certain extent, against its natural enemy: the eye is adapted to
          the light and its refrangibility, the lungs and the blood to the
          air, the air-bladder of fish to water, the eye of the seal to the
          change of the medium in which it must see, the water-pouch in the
          stomach of the camel to the drought of the African deserts, the
          sail of the nautilus to the wind that is to drive its little bark,
          and so on down to the most special and astonishing outward
          adaptations.<a href="#note_40" id="noteref_40" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">40</span></span></a> We
          must abstract however here from all temporal relations, for these
          can only concern the manifestation of the Idea, not the Idea
          itself. Accordingly this kind of explanation must also be used
          retrospectively, and we must not merely admit that every species
          accommodated itself to the given environment, but also that this
          environment itself, which preceded it in time, had just as much
          regard for the being <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page209">[pg
          209]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg209"></a>
          that would some time come into it. For it is one and the same will
          that objectifies itself in the whole world; it knows no time, for
          this form of the principle of sufficient reason does not belong to
          it, nor to its original objectivity, the Ideas, but only to the way
          in which these are known by the individuals who themselves are
          transitory, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, to the manifestation of
          the Ideas. Thus, time has no significance for our present
          examination of the manner in which the objectification of the will
          distributes itself among the Ideas, and the Ideas whose <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">manifestations</span></em> entered into the
          course of time earlier, according to the law of causality, to which
          as phenomena they are subject, have no advantage over those whose
          manifestation entered later; nay rather, these last are the
          completest objectifications of the will, to which the earlier
          manifestations must adapt themselves just as much as they must
          adapt themselves to the earlier. Thus the course of the planets,
          the tendency to the ellipse, the rotation of the earth, the
          division of land and sea, the atmosphere, light, warmth, and all
          such phenomena, which are in nature what bass is in harmony,
          adapted themselves in anticipation of the coming species of living
          creatures of which they were to become the supporter and sustainer.
          In the same way the ground adapted itself to the nutrition of
          plants, plants adapted themselves to the nutrition of animals,
          animals to that of other animals, and conversely they all adapted
          themselves to the nutrition of the ground. All the parts of nature
          correspond to each other, for it is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em>
          will that appears in them all, but the course of time is quite
          foreign to its original and only <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">adequate
          objectification</span></em> (this expression will be explained in
          the following book), the Ideas. Even now, when the species have
          only to sustain themselves, no longer to come into existence, we
          see here and there some such forethought of nature extending to the
          future, and abstracting as it were from the process of time, a
          self-adaptation of what is to what <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page210">[pg 210]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg210"></a> is yet to come. The bird builds the nest for
          the young which it does not yet know; the beaver constructs a dam
          the object of which is unknown to it; ants, marmots, and bees lay
          in provision for the winter they have never experienced; the spider
          and the ant-lion make snares, as if with deliberate cunning, for
          future unknown prey; insects deposit their eggs where the coming
          brood finds future nourishment. In the spring-time the female
          flower of the diœcian valisneria unwinds the spirals of its stalk,
          by which till now it was held at the bottom of the water, and thus
          rises to the surface. Just then the male flower, which grows on a
          short stalk from the bottom, breaks away, and so, at the sacrifice
          of its life, reaches the surface, where it swims about in search of
          the female. The latter is fructified, and then draws itself down
          again to the bottom by contracting its spirals, and there the fruit
          grows.<a href="#note_41" id="noteref_41" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">41</span></span></a> I must
          again refer here to the larva of the male stag-beetle, which makes
          the hole in the wood for its metamorphosis as big again as the
          female does, in order to have room for its future horns. The
          instinct of animals in general gives us the best illustration of
          what remains of teleology in nature. For as instinct is an action,
          like that which is guided by the conception of an end, and yet is
          entirely without this; so all construction of nature resembles that
          which is guided by the conception of an end, and yet is entirely
          without it. For in the outer as in the inner teleology of nature,
          what we are obliged to think as means and end is, in every case,
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the
          manifestation of the unity of the one will so thoroughly agreeing
          with itself</span></em>, which has assumed multiplicity in space
          and time for our manner of knowing.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The reciprocal
          adaptation and self-accommodation of phenomena that springs from
          this unity cannot, however, annul the inner contradiction which
          appears in the universal conflict of nature described above, and
          which <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page211">[pg 211]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg211"></a> is essential to the
          will. That harmony goes only so far as to render possible the
          duration of the world and the different kinds of existences in it,
          which without it would long since have perished. Therefore it only
          extends to the continuance of the species, and the general
          conditions of life, but not to that of the individual. If, then, by
          reason of that harmony and accommodation, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">species</span></em>
          in organised nature and the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">universal forces</span></em> in unorganised
          nature continue to exist beside each other, and indeed support each
          other reciprocally, on the other hand, the inner contradiction of
          the will which objectifies itself in all these ideas shows itself
          in the ceaseless internecine war of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">individuals</span></em> of these species, and
          in the constant struggle of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">manifestations</span></em> of these natural
          forces with each other, as we pointed out above. The scene and the
          object of this conflict is matter, which they try to wrest from
          each other, and also space and time, the combination of which
          through the form of causality is, in fact, matter, as was explained
          in the First Book.<a href="#note_42" id="noteref_42" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">42</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 29. I here
          conclude the second principal division of my exposition, in the
          hope that, so far as is possible in the case of an entirely new
          thought, which cannot be quite free from traces of the
          individuality in which it originated, I have succeeded in conveying
          to the reader the complete certainty that this world in which we
          live and have our being is in its whole nature through and through
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em>, and at the same time through
          and through <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">idea</span></em>: that this idea, as such,
          already presupposes a form, object and subject, is therefore
          relative; and if we ask what remains if we take away this form, and
          all those forms which are subordinate to it, and which express the
          principle of sufficient reason, the answer must be that as
          something <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">toto genere</span></span>
          different from idea, this can be nothing but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em>,
          which is thus properly the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thing-in-itself</span></em>. Every one finds
          that he himself is this will, in which the real nature of the world
          consists, and he also <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page212">[pg
          212]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg212"></a>
          finds that he is the knowing subject, whose idea the whole world
          is, the world which exists only in relation to his consciousness,
          as its necessary supporter. Every one is thus himself in a double
          aspect the whole world, the microcosm; finds both sides whole and
          complete in himself. And what he thus recognises as his own real
          being also exhausts the being of the whole world—the macrocosm;
          thus the world, like man, is through and through <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em>,
          and through and through <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">idea</span></em>, and nothing more than this.
          So we see the philosophy of Thales, which concerned the macrocosm,
          unite at this point with that of Socrates, which dealt with the
          microcosm, for the object of both is found to be the same. But all
          the knowledge that has been communicated in the two first books
          will gain greater completeness, and consequently greater certainty,
          from the two following books, in which I hope that several
          questions that have more or less distinctly arisen in the course of
          our work will also be sufficiently answered.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the meantime
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> such question may be more
          particularly considered, for it can only properly arise so long as
          one has not fully penetrated the meaning of the foregoing
          exposition, and may so far serve as an illustration of it. It is
          this: Every will is a will towards something, has an object, an end
          of its willing; what then is the final end, or towards what is that
          will striving that is exhibited to us as the being-in-itself of the
          world? This question rests, like so many others, upon the confusion
          of the thing-in-itself with the manifestation. The principle of
          sufficient reason, of which the law of motivation is also a form,
          extends only to the latter, not to the former. It is only of
          phenomena, of individual things, that a ground can be given, never
          of the will itself, nor of the Idea in which it adequately
          objectifies itself. So then of every particular movement or change
          of any kind in nature, a cause is to be sought, that is, a
          condition that of necessity produced it, but never of the
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page213">[pg 213]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg213"></a> natural force itself
          which is revealed in this and innumerable similar phenomena; and it
          is therefore simple misunderstanding, arising from want of
          consideration, to ask for a cause of gravity, electricity, and so
          on. Only if one had somehow shown that gravity and electricity were
          not original special forces of nature, but only the manifestations
          of a more general force already known, would it be allowable to ask
          for the cause which made this force produce the phenomena of
          gravity or of electricity here. All this has been explained at
          length above. In the same way every particular act of will of a
          knowing individual (which is itself only a manifestation of will as
          the thing-in-itself) has necessarily a motive without which that
          act would never have occurred; but just as material causes contain
          merely the determination that at this time, in this place, and in
          this matter, a manifestation of this or that natural force must
          take place, so the motive determines only the act of will of a
          knowing being, at this time, in this place, and under these
          circumstances, as a particular act, but by no means determines that
          that being wills in general or wills in this manner; this is the
          expression of his intelligible character, which, as will itself,
          the thing-in-itself, is without ground, for it lies outside the
          province of the principle of sufficient reason. Therefore every man
          has permanent aims and motives by which he guides his conduct, and
          he can always give an account of his particular actions; but if he
          were asked why he wills at all, or why in general he wills to
          exist, he would have no answer, and the question would indeed seem
          to him meaningless; and this would be just the expression of his
          consciousness that he himself is nothing but will, whose willing
          stands by itself and requires more particular determination by
          motives only in its individual acts at each point of time.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In fact, freedom
          from all aim, from all limits, belongs to the nature of the will,
          which is an endless striving. This was already touched on above in
          the reference to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page214">[pg
          214]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg214"></a>
          centrifugal force. It also discloses itself in its simplest form in
          the lowest grade of the objectification of will, in gravitation,
          which we see constantly exerting itself, though a final goal is
          obviously impossible for it. For if, according to its will, all
          existing matter were collected in one mass, yet within this mass
          gravity, ever striving towards the centre, would still wage war
          with impenetrability as rigidity or elasticity. The tendency of
          matter can therefore only be confined, never completed or appeased.
          But this is precisely the case with all tendencies of all phenomena
          of will. Every attained end is also the beginning of a new course,
          and so on <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ad infinitum</span></span>.
          The plant raises its manifestation from the seed through the stem
          and the leaf to the blossom and the fruit, which again is the
          beginning of a new seed, a new individual, that runs through the
          old course, and so on through endless time. Such also is the life
          of the animal; procreation is its highest point, and after
          attaining to it, the life of the first individual quickly or slowly
          sinks, while a new life ensures to nature the endurance of the
          species and repeats the same phenomena. Indeed, the constant
          renewal of the matter of every organism is also to be regarded as
          merely the manifestation of this continual pressure and change, and
          physiologists are now ceasing to hold that it is the necessary
          reparation of the matter wasted in motion, for the possible wearing
          out of the machine can by no means be equivalent to the support it
          is constantly receiving through nourishment. Eternal becoming,
          endless flux, characterises the revelation of the inner nature of
          will. Finally, the same thing shows itself in human endeavours and
          desires, which always delude us by presenting their satisfaction as
          the final end of will. As soon as we attain to them they no longer
          appear the same, and therefore they soon grow stale, are forgotten,
          and though not openly disowned, are yet always thrown aside as
          vanished illusions. We are fortunate enough if there <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page215">[pg 215]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg215"></a> still remains something to wish for and
          to strive after, that the game may be kept up of constant
          transition from desire to satisfaction, and from satisfaction to a
          new desire, the rapid course of which is called happiness, and the
          slow course sorrow, and does not sink into that stagnation that
          shows itself in fearful ennui that paralyses life, vain yearning
          without a definite object, deadening languor. According to all
          this, when the will is enlightened by knowledge, it always knows
          what it wills now and here, never what it wills in general; every
          particular act of will has its end, the whole will has none; just
          as every particular phenomenon of nature is determined by a
          sufficient cause so far as concerns its appearance in this place at
          this time, but the force which manifests itself in it has no
          general cause, for it belongs to the thing-in-itself, to the
          groundless will. The single example of self-knowledge of the will
          as a whole is the idea as a whole, the whole world of perception.
          It is the objectification, the revelation, the mirror of the will.
          What the will expresses in it will be the subject of our further
          consideration.<a href="#note_43" id="noteref_43" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">43</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 30. In the
          First Book the world was explained as mere <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">idea</span></em>,
          object for a subject. In the Second Book we considered it from its
          other side, and found that in this aspect it is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em>,
          which proved to be simply that which this world is besides being
          idea. In accordance with this knowledge we called the world as
          idea, both as a whole and in its parts, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">objectification of
          will</span></em>, which therefore means the will become object,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, idea. Further, we remember
          that this objectification of will was found to have many definite
          grades, in which, with gradually increasing distinctness and
          completeness, the nature of will appears in the idea, that is to
          say, presents itself as object. In these grades we already
          recognised the Platonic Ideas, for the grades are just the
          determined species, or the original unchanging forms and qualities
          of all natural bodies, both organised and unorganised, and also the
          general forces which reveal themselves according to natural laws.
          These Ideas, then, as a whole express themselves in innumerable
          individuals and particulars, and are related to these as archetypes
          to their copies. The multiplicity of such individuals is only
          conceivable through time and space, their appearing and passing
          away through causality, and in all these forms we recognise merely
          the different modes of the principle of sufficient reason, which is
          the ultimate principle of all that is finite, of all individual
          existence, and the universal form of the idea as it appears in the
          knowledge of the individual as such. The Platonic Idea, on the
          other <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page220">[pg 220]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg220"></a> hand, does not come
          under this principle, and has therefore neither multiplicity nor
          change. While the individuals in which it expresses itself are
          innumerable, and unceasingly come into being and pass away, it
          remains unchanged as one and the same, and the principle of
          sufficient reason has for it no meaning. As, however, this is the
          form under which all knowledge of the subject comes, so far as the
          subject knows as an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">individual</span></em>, the Ideas lie quite
          outside the sphere of its knowledge. If, therefore, the Ideas are
          to become objects of knowledge, this can only happen by
          transcending the individuality of the knowing subject. The more
          exact and detailed explanation of this is what will now occupy our
          attention.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 31. First,
          however, the following very essential remark. I hope that in the
          preceding book I have succeeded in producing the conviction that
          what is called in the Kantian philosophy the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thing-in-itself</span></em>, and appears there
          as so significant, and yet so obscure and paradoxical a doctrine,
          and especially on account of the manner in which Kant introduced it
          as an inference from the caused to the cause, was considered a
          stumbling-stone, and, in fact, the weak side of his
          philosophy,—that this, I say, if it is reached by the entirely
          different way by which we have arrived at it, is nothing but the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em> when the sphere of that
          conception is extended and defined in the way I have shown. I hope,
          further, that after what has been said there will be no hesitation
          in recognising the definite grades of the objectification of the
          will, which is the inner reality of the world, to be what Plato
          called the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">eternal Ideas</span></em> or unchangeable
          forms (ειδῆ); a doctrine which is regarded as the principal, but at
          the same time the most obscure and paradoxical dogma of his system,
          and has been the subject of reflection and controversy of ridicule
          and of reverence to so many and such differently endowed minds in
          the course of many centuries.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page221">[pg 221]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg221"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If now the will
          is for us the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thing-in-itself</span></em>, and the Idea is
          the immediate objectivity of that will at a definite grade, we find
          that Kant's thing-in-itself, and Plato's Idea, which to him is the
          only οντως ον, these two great obscure paradoxes of the two
          greatest philosophers of the West are not indeed identical, but yet
          very closely related, and only distinguished by a single
          circumstance. The purport of these two great paradoxes, with all
          inner harmony and relationship, is yet so very different on account
          of the remarkable diversity of the individuality of their authors,
          that they are the best commentary on each other, for they are like
          two entirely different roads that conduct us to the same goal. This
          is easily made clear. What Kant says is in substance
          this:—<span class="tei tei-q">“Time, space, and causality are not
          determinations of the thing-in-itself, but belong only to its
          phenomenal existence, for they are nothing but the forms of our
          knowledge. Since, however, all multiplicity, and all coming into
          being and passing away, are only possible through time, space, and
          causality, it follows that they also belong only to the phenomenon,
          not to the thing-in-itself. But as our knowledge is conditioned by
          these forms, the whole of experience is only knowledge of the
          phenomenon, not of the thing-in-itself; therefore its laws cannot
          be made valid for the thing-in-itself. This extends even to our own
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ego</span></em>, and we know it only as
          phenomenon, and not according to what it may be in itself.”</span>
          This is the meaning and content of the doctrine of Kant in the
          important respect we are considering. What Plato says is
          this:—<span class="tei tei-q">“The things of this world which our
          senses perceive have no true being; <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">they always become,
          they never are:</span></em> they have only a relative being; they
          all exist merely in and through their relations to each other;
          their whole being may, therefore, quite as well be called a
          non-being. They are consequently not objects of a true knowledge
          (επιστημη), for such a knowledge can only be of what exists for
          itself, and always in the same way; <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page222">[pg 222]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg222"></a> they, on the contrary, are only the objects
          of an opinion based on sensation (δοξα μετ᾽ αισθησεως αλογου). So
          long as we are confined to the perception of these, we are like men
          who sit in a dark cave, bound so fast that they cannot turn their
          heads, and who see nothing but the shadows of real things which
          pass between them and a fire burning behind them, the light of
          which casts the shadows on the wall opposite them; and even of
          themselves and of each other they see only the shadows on the wall.
          Their wisdom would thus consist in predicting the order of the
          shadows learned from experience. The real archetypes, on the other
          hand, to which these shadows correspond, the eternal Ideas, the
          original forms of all things, can alone be said to have true being
          (οντως ον), because they <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">always are, but never become nor pass
          away</span></em>. To them belongs <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no
          multiplicity</span></em>; for each of them is according to its
          nature only one, for it is the archetype itself, of which all
          particular transitory things of the same kind which are named after
          it are copies or shadows. They have also <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no coming into
          being nor passing away</span></em>, for they are truly being, never
          becoming nor vanishing, like their fleeting shadows. (It is
          necessarily presupposed, however, in these two negative
          definitions, that time, space, and causality have no significance
          or validity for these Ideas, and that they do not exist in them.)
          Of these only can there be true knowledge, for the object of such
          knowledge can only be that which always and in every respect (thus
          in-itself) is; not that which is and again is not, according as we
          look at it.”</span> This is Plato's doctrine. It is clear, and
          requires no further proof that the inner meaning of both doctrines
          is entirely the same; that both explain the visible world as a
          manifestation, which in itself is nothing, and which only has
          meaning and a borrowed reality through that which expresses itself
          in it (in the one case the thing-in-itself, in the other the Idea).
          To this last, which has true being, all the forms of that
          phenomenal existence, even <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page223">[pg 223]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg223"></a> the most universal and essential, are,
          according to both doctrines, entirely foreign. In order to disown
          these forms Kant has directly expressed them even in abstract
          terms, and distinctly refused time, space, and causality as mere
          forms of the phenomenon to the thing-in-itself. Plato, on the other
          hand, did not attain to the fullest expression, and has only
          distinctly refused these forms to his Ideas in that he denies of
          the Ideas what is only possible through these forms, multiplicity
          of similar things, coming into being and passing away. Though it is
          perhaps superfluous, I should like to illustrate this remarkable
          and important agreement by an example. There stands before us, let
          us suppose, an animal in the full activity of life. Plato would
          say, <span class="tei tei-q">“This animal has no true existence,
          but merely an apparent existence, a constant becoming, a relative
          existence which may just as well be called non-being as being. Only
          the Idea which expresses itself in that animal is truly
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘being,’</span> or the animal in-itself
          (αυτο το θηριον), which is dependent upon nothing, but is in and
          for itself (καθ᾽ ἑαυτο, αει ὡς αυτως); it has not become, it will
          not end, but always is in the same way (αει ον, και μηδεποτε ουτε
          γυγνομενον ουτε απολλυμενον). If now we recognise its Idea in this
          animal, it is all one and of no importance whether we have this
          animal now before us or its progenitor of a thousand years ago,
          whether it is here or in a distant land, whether it presents itself
          in this or that manner, position, or action; whether, lastly, it is
          this or any other individual of the same species; all this is
          nothing, and only concerns the phenomenon; the Idea of the animal
          alone has true being, and is the object of real knowledge.”</span>
          So Plato; Kant would say something of this kind, <span class="tei tei-q">“This animal is a phenomenon in time, space, and
          causality, which are collectively the conditions <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span> of the possibility of
          experience, lying in our faculty of knowledge, not determinations
          of the thing-in-itself. Therefore this animal as we perceive it at
          this definite point of time, in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page224">[pg 224]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg224"></a> this particular place, as an individual in
          the connection of experience (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, in the chain of causes and
          effects), which has come into being, and will just as necessarily
          pass away, is not a thing-in-itself, but a phenomenon which only
          exists in relation to our knowledge. To know it as what it may be
          in itself, that is to say, independent of all the determinations
          which lie in time, space, and causality, would demand another kind
          of knowledge than that which is possible for us through the senses
          and the understanding.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In order to
          bring Kant's mode of expression nearer the Platonic, we might say:
          Time, space, and causality are that arrangement of our intellect by
          virtue of which the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> being of each kind which alone
          really is, manifests itself to us as a multiplicity of similar
          beings, constantly appearing and disappearing in endless
          succession. The apprehension of things by means of and in
          accordance with this arrangement is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">immanent</span></em> knowledge; that, on the
          other hand, which is conscious of the true state of the case, is
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">transcendental</span></em> knowledge. The
          latter is obtained <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">in
          abstracto</span></span> through the criticism of pure reason, but
          in exceptional cases it may also appear intuitively. This last is
          an addition of my own, which I am endeavouring in this Third Book
          to explain.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If the doctrine
          of Kant had ever been properly understood and grasped, and since
          Kant's time that of Plato, if men had truly and earnestly reflected
          on the inner meaning and content of the teaching of these two great
          masters, instead of involving themselves in the technicalities of
          the one and writing parodies of the style of the other, they could
          not have failed to discern long ago to what an extent these two
          great philosophers agree, and that the true meaning, the aim of
          both systems, is the same. Not only would they have refrained from
          constantly comparing Plato to Leibnitz, on whom his spirit
          certainly did not rest, or indeed to a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page225">[pg 225]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg225"></a> well-known gentleman who is still
          alive,<a href="#note_44" id="noteref_44" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">44</span></span></a> as if
          they wanted to mock the manes of the great thinker of the past; but
          they would have advanced much farther in general, or rather they
          would not have fallen so disgracefully far behind as they have in
          the last forty years. They would not have let themselves be led by
          the nose, to-day by one vain boaster and to-morrow by another, nor
          would they have opened the nineteenth century, which promised so
          much in Germany, with the philosophical farces that were performed
          over the grave of Kant (as the ancients sometimes did at the
          funeral obsequies of their dead), and which deservedly called forth
          the derision of other nations, for such things least become the
          earnest and strait-laced German. But so small is the chosen public
          of true philosophers, that even students who understand are but
          scantily brought them by the centuries—Εισι δη ναρθηκοφοροι μεν
          πολλοι, βακχοι δε γε παυροι (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Thyrsigeri quidem multi, Baachi vero
          pauci</span></span>). Ἡ ατιμια φιλοσοφιᾳ δια ταυτα προσπεπτωκεν,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Men followed the
          words,—such words as <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span> ideas,”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“forms of perception and thought existing
          in consciousness independently of experience,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“fundamental conceptions of the pure
          understanding,”</span> &amp;c., &amp;c.,—and asked whether Plato's
          Ideas, which were also original conceptions, and besides this were
          supposed to be reminiscences of a perception before life of the
          truly real things, were in some way the same as Kant's forms of
          perception and thought, which lie <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          priori</span></span> in our consciousness. On account of some
          slight resemblance in the expression of these two entirely
          different doctrines, the Kantian doctrine of the forms which limit
          the knowledge of the individual to the phenomenon, and the Platonic
          doctrine <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page226">[pg
          226]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg226"></a>
          of Ideas, the knowledge of which these very forms expressly deny,
          these so far diametrically opposed doctrines were carefully
          compared, and men deliberated and disputed as to whether they were
          identical, found at last that they were not the same, and concluded
          that Plato's doctrine of Ideas and Kant's <span class="tei tei-q">“Critique of Reason”</span> had nothing in common. But
          enough of this.<a href="#note_45" id="noteref_45" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">45</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 32. It follows
          from our consideration of the subject, that, for us, Idea and
          thing-in-itself are not entirely one and the same, in spite of the
          inner agreement between Kant and Plato, and the identity of the aim
          they had before them, or the conception of the world which roused
          them and led them to philosophise. The Idea is for us rather the
          direct, and therefore adequate, objectivity of the thing-in-itself,
          which is, however, itself the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em>—the will as not yet
          objectified, not yet become idea. For the thing-in-itself must,
          even according to Kant, be free from all the forms connected with
          knowing as such; and it is merely an error on his part (as is shown
          in the Appendix) that he did not count among these forms, before
          all others, that of being object for a subject, for it is the first
          and most universal form of all phenomena, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          of all idea; he should therefore have distinctly denied objective
          existence to his thing-in-itself, which would have saved him from a
          great inconsistency that was soon discovered. The Platonic Idea, on
          the other hand, is necessarily object, something known, an idea,
          and in that respect is different from the thing-in-itself, but in
          that respect only. It has merely laid aside the subordinate forms
          of the phenomenon, all of which we include in the principle of
          sufficient reason, or rather it has not yet assumed them; but it
          has retained the first and most universal form, that of the idea in
          general, the form of being object for a subject. It is the forms
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page227">[pg 227]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg227"></a> which are
          subordinate to this (whose general expression is the principle of
          sufficient reason) that multiply the Idea in particular transitory
          individuals, whose number is a matter of complete indifference to
          the Idea. The principle of sufficient reason is thus again the form
          into which the Idea enters when it appears in the knowledge of the
          subject as individual. The particular thing that manifests itself
          in accordance with the principle of sufficient reason is thus only
          an indirect objectification of the thing-in-itself (which is the
          will), for between it and the thing-in-itself stands the Idea as
          the only direct objectivity of the will, because it has assumed
          none of the special forms of knowledge as such, except that of the
          idea in general, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the form of being object
          for a subject. Therefore it alone is the most <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">adequate
          objectivity</span></em> of the will or thing-in-itself which is
          possible; indeed it is the whole thing-in-itself, only under the
          form of the idea; and here lies the ground of the great agreement
          between Plato and Kant, although, in strict accuracy, that of which
          they speak is not the same. But the particular things are no really
          adequate objectivity of the will, for in them it is obscured by
          those forms whose general expression is the principle of sufficient
          reason, but which are conditions of the knowledge which belongs to
          the individual as such. If it is allowable to draw conclusions from
          an impossible presupposition, we would, in fact, no longer know
          particular things, nor events, nor change, nor multiplicity, but
          would comprehend only Ideas,—only the grades of the objectification
          of that one will, of the thing-in-itself, in pure unclouded
          knowledge. Consequently our world would be a <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">nunc stans</span></span>, if it were not that,
          as knowing subjects, we are also individuals, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          our perceptions come to us through the medium of a body, from the
          affections of which they proceed, and which is itself only concrete
          willing, objectivity of the will, and thus is an object among
          objects, and as such comes into the knowing consciousness in the
          only way in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page228">[pg
          228]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg228"></a>
          which an object can, through the forms of the principle of
          sufficient reason, and consequently already presupposes, and
          therefore brings in, time, and all other forms which that principle
          expresses. Time is only the broken and piecemeal view which the
          individual being has of the Ideas, which are outside time, and
          consequently <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">eternal</span></em>. Therefore Plato says time
          is the moving picture of eternity: αιωνος εικων κινητη ὁ
          χρονος.<a href="#note_46" id="noteref_46" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">46</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 33. Since now,
          as individuals, we have no other knowledge than that which is
          subject to the principle of sufficient reason, and this form of
          knowledge excludes the Ideas, it is certain that if it is possible
          for us to raise ourselves from the knowledge of particular things
          to that of the Ideas, this can only happen by an alteration taking
          place in the subject which is analogous and corresponds to the
          great change of the whole nature of the object, and by virtue of
          which the subject, so far as it knows an Idea, is no more
          individual.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It will be
          remembered from the preceding book that knowledge in general
          belongs to the objectification of will at its higher grades, and
          sensibility, nerves, and brain, just like the other parts of the
          organised being, are the expression of the will at this stage of
          its objectivity, and therefore the idea which appears through them
          is also in the same way bound to the service of will as a means
          (μηχανη) for the attainment of its now complicated (πολυτελεστερα)
          aims for sustaining a being of manifold requirements. Thus
          originally and according to its nature, knowledge is completely
          subject to the will, and, like the immediate object, which, by
          means of the application of the law of causality, is its
          starting-point, all knowledge which proceeds in accordance with the
          principle of sufficient reason remains in a closer or more distant
          relation to the will. For the individual finds his body as an
          object among objects, to all of which it is related and connected
          according to the principle <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page229">[pg 229]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg229"></a> of sufficient reason. Thus all investigations
          of these relations and connections lead back to his body, and
          consequently to his will. Since it is the principle of sufficient
          reason which places the objects in this relation to the body, and,
          through it, to the will, the one endeavour of the knowledge which
          is subject to this principle will be to find out the relations in
          which objects are placed to each other through this principle, and
          thus to trace their innumerable connections in space, time, and
          causality. For only through these is the object <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">interesting</span></em> to the individual,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, related to the will.
          Therefore the knowledge which is subject to the will knows nothing
          further of objects than their relations, knows the objects only so
          far as they exist at this time, in this place, under these
          circumstances, from these causes, and with these effects—in a word,
          as particular things; and if all these relations were to be taken
          away, the objects would also have disappeared for it, because it
          knew nothing more about them. We must not disguise the fact that
          what the sciences consider in things is also in reality nothing
          more than this; their relations, the connections of time and space,
          the causes of natural changes, the resemblance of forms, the
          motives of actions,—thus merely relations. What distinguishes
          science from ordinary knowledge is merely its systematic form, the
          facilitating of knowledge by the comprehension of all particulars
          in the universal, by means of the subordination of concepts, and
          the completeness of knowledge which is thereby attained. All
          relation has itself only a relative existence; for example, all
          being in time is also non-being; for time is only that by means of
          which opposite determinations can belong to the same thing;
          therefore every phenomenon which is in time again is not, for what
          separates its beginning from its end is only time, which is
          essentially a fleeting, inconstant, and relative thing, here called
          duration. But time is the most universal form of all objects of the
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page230">[pg 230]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg230"></a> knowledge which is
          subject to the will, and the prototype of its other forms.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Knowledge now,
          as a rule, remains always subordinate to the service of the will,
          as indeed it originated for this service, and grew, so to speak, to
          the will, as the head to the body. In the case of the brutes this
          subjection of knowledge to the will can never be abolished. In the
          case of men it can be abolished only in exceptional cases, which we
          shall presently consider more closely. This distinction between man
          and brute is outwardly expressed by the difference of the relation
          of the head to the body. In the case of the lower brutes both are
          deformed: in all brutes the head is directed towards the earth,
          where the objects of its will lie; even in the higher species the
          head and the body are still far more one than in the case of man,
          whose head seems freely set upon his body, as if only carried by
          and not serving it. This human excellence is exhibited in the
          highest degree by the Apollo of Belvedere; the head of the god of
          the Muses, with eyes fixed on the far distance, stands so freely on
          his shoulders that it seems wholly delivered from the body, and no
          more subject to its cares.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 34. The
          transition which we have referred to as possible, but yet to be
          regarded as only exceptional, from the common knowledge of
          particular things to the knowledge of the Idea, takes place
          suddenly; for knowledge breaks free from the service of the will,
          by the subject ceasing to be merely individual, and thus becoming
          the pure will-less subject of knowledge, which no longer traces
          relations in accordance with the principle of sufficient reason,
          but rests in fixed contemplation of the object presented to it, out
          of its connection with all others, and rises into it.</p>

          explanation is necessary to make this clear, and the reader must
          suspend his surprise for a while, till he has grasped the whole

          itself.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page231">[pg

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If, raised by
          the power of the mind, a man relinquishes the common way of looking
          at things, gives up tracing, under the guidance of the forms of the
          principle of sufficient reason, their relations to each other, the
          final goal of which is always a relation to his own will; if he
          thus ceases to consider the where, the when, the why, and the
          whither of things, and looks simply and solely at the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">what</span></em>;
          if, further, he does not allow abstract thought, the concepts of
          the reason, to take possession of his consciousness, but, instead
          of all this, gives the whole power of his mind to perception, sinks
          himself entirely in this, and lets his whole consciousness be
          filled with the quiet contemplation of the natural object actually
          present, whether a landscape, a tree, a mountain, a building, or
          whatever it may be; inasmuch as he <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">loses</span></em>
          himself in this object (to use a pregnant German idiom),
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, forgets even his
          individuality, his will, and only continues to exist as the pure
          subject, the clear mirror of the object, so that it is as if the
          object alone were there, without any one to perceive it, and he can
          no longer separate the perceiver from the perception, but both have
          become one, because the whole consciousness is filled and occupied
          with one single sensuous picture; if thus the object has to such an
          extent passed out of all relation to something outside it, and the
          subject out of all relation to the will, then that which is so
          known is no longer the particular thing as such; but it is the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Idea</span></em>, the eternal form, the
          immediate objectivity of the will at this grade; and, therefore, he
          who is sunk in this perception is no longer individual, for in such
          perception the individual has lost himself; but he is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pure</span></em>,
          will-less, painless, timeless <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">subject of knowledge</span></em>. This, which
          in itself is so remarkable (which I well know confirms the saying
          that originated with Thomas Paine, <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">Du
          sublime au ridicule il n'y a qu'un pas</span></span>), will by
          degrees become clearer and less surprising from what follows. It
          was this that was running in Spinoza's mind when he wrote:
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Meus æterna est, quatenus res sub æternitatis
          specie</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page232">[pg
          232]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg232"></a><span style="font-style: italic">concipit</span></span> (Eth. V. pr. 31,
          Schol.)<a href="#note_47" id="noteref_47" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">47</span></span></a> In
          such contemplation the particular thing becomes at once the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Idea</span></em> of its species, and the
          perceiving individual becomes <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pure subject of knowledge</span></em>. The
          individual, as such, knows only particular things; the pure subject
          of knowledge knows only Ideas. For the individual is the subject of
          knowledge in its relation to a definite particular manifestation of
          will, and in subjection to this. This particular manifestation of
          will is, as such, subordinated to the principle of sufficient
          reason in all its forms; therefore, all knowledge which relates
          itself to it also follows the principle of sufficient reason, and
          no other kind of knowledge is fitted to be of use to the will but
          this, which always consists merely of relations to the object. The
          knowing individual as such, and the particular things known by him,
          are always in some place, at some time, and are links in the chain
          of causes and effects. The pure subject of knowledge and his
          correlative, the Idea, have passed out of all these forms of the
          principle of sufficient reason: time, place, the individual that
          knows, and the individual that is known, have for them no meaning.
          When an individual knower has raised himself in the manner
          described to be pure subject of knowledge, and at the same time has
          raised the observed object to the Platonic Idea, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">world as
          idea</span></em> appears complete and pure, and the full
          objectification of the will takes place, for the Platonic Idea
          alone is its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">adequate objectivity</span></em>. The Idea
          includes object and subject in like manner in itself, for they are
          its one form; but in it they are absolutely of equal importance;
          for as the object is here, as elsewhere, simply the idea of the
          subject, the subject, which passes entirely into the perceived
          object has thus become this object itself, for the whole
          consciousness is nothing but its perfectly <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page233">[pg 233]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg233"></a> distinct picture. Now this consciousness
          constitutes the whole <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">world as idea</span></em>, for one imagines
          the whole of the Platonic Ideas, or grades of the objectivity of
          will, in their series passing through it. The particular things of
          all time and space are nothing but Ideas multiplied through the
          principle of sufficient reason (the form of the knowledge of the
          individual as such), and thus obscured as regards their pure
          objectivity. When the Platonic Idea appears, in it subject and
          object are no longer to be distinguished, for the Platonic Idea,
          the adequate objectivity of will, the true world as idea, arises
          only when the subject and object reciprocally fill and penetrate
          each other completely; and in the same way the knowing and the
          known individuals, as things in themselves, are not to be
          distinguished. For if we look entirely away from the true
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">world as
          idea</span></em>, there remains nothing but the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">world as
          will</span></em>. The will is the <span class="tei tei-q">“in-itself”</span> of the Platonic Idea, which fully
          objectifies it; it is also the <span class="tei tei-q">“in-itself”</span> of the particular thing and of the
          individual that knows it, which objectify it incompletely. As will,
          outside the idea and all its forms, it is one and the same in the
          object contemplated and in the individual, who soars aloft in this
          contemplation, and becomes conscious of himself as pure subject.
          These two are, therefore, in themselves not different, for in
          themselves they are will, which here knows itself; and multiplicity
          and difference exist only as the way in which this knowledge comes
          to the will, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, only in the phenomenon, on
          account of its form, the principle of sufficient reason.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now the known
          thing, without me as the subject of knowledge, is just as little an
          object, and not mere will, blind effort, as without the object,
          without the idea, I am a knowing subject and not mere blind will.
          This will is in itself, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, outside the idea, one and
          the same with mine: only in the world as idea, whose form is always
          at least that of subject and object, we are separated as the known
          and the knowing individual. As <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page234">[pg 234]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg234"></a> soon as knowledge, the world as idea, is
          abolished, there remains nothing but mere will, blind effort. That
          it should receive objectivity, become idea, supposes at once both
          subject and object; but that this should be pure, complete, and
          adequate objectivity of the will, supposes the object as Platonic
          Idea, free from the forms of the principle of sufficient reason,
          and the subject as the pure subject of knowledge, free from
          individuality and subjection to the will.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whoever now,
          has, after the manner referred to, become so absorbed and lost in
          the perception of nature that he only continues to exist as the
          pure knowing subject, becomes in this way directly conscious that,
          as such, he is the condition, that is, the supporter, of the world
          and all objective existence; for this now shows itself as dependent
          upon his existence. Thus he draws nature into himself, so that he
          sees it to be merely an accident of his own being. In this sense
          Byron says—</p>

          with the consciousness, which the Upanishad of the Veda expresses:

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 35. In order
          to gain a deeper insight into the nature of the world, it is
          absolutely necessary that we should learn to distinguish the will
          as thing-in-itself from its adequate objectivity, and also the
          different grades in which this appears more and more distinctly and
          fully, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the Ideas themselves, from
          the merely phenomenal existence of these Ideas in the forms of the
          principle of sufficient reason, the restricted method of knowledge
          of the individual. We shall then agree with Plato when he
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page235">[pg 235]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg235"></a> attributes actual
          being only to the Ideas, and allows only an illusive, dream-like
          existence to things in space and time, the real world for the
          individual. Then we shall understand how one and the same Idea
          reveals itself in so many phenomena, and presents its nature only
          bit by bit to the individual, one side after another. Then we shall
          also distinguish the Idea itself from the way in which its
          manifestation appears in the observation of the individual, and
          recognise the former as essential and the latter as unessential.
          Let us consider this with the help of examples taken from the most
          insignificant things, and also from the greatest. When the clouds
          move, the figures which they form are not essential, but
          indifferent to them; but that as elastic vapour they are pressed
          together, drifted along, spread out, or torn asunder by the force
          of the wind: this is their nature, the essence of the forces which
          objectify themselves in them, the Idea; their actual forms are only
          for the individual observer. To the brook that flows over stones,
          the eddies, the waves, the foam-flakes which it forms are
          indifferent and unessential; but that it follows the attraction of
          gravity, and behaves as inelastic, perfectly mobile, formless,
          transparent fluid: this is its nature; this, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">if known through
          perception</span></em>, is its Idea; these accidental forms are
          only for us so long as we know as individuals. The ice on the
          window-pane forms itself into crystals according to the laws of
          crystallisation, which reveal the essence of the force of nature
          that appears here, exhibit the Idea; but the trees and flowers
          which it traces on the pane are unessential, and are only there for
          us. What appears in the clouds, the brook, and the crystal is the
          weakest echo of that will which appears more fully in the plant,
          more fully still in the beast, and most fully in man. But only the
          essential in all these grades of its objectification constitutes
          the Idea; on the other hand, its unfolding or development, because
          broken up in the forms of the principle of sufficient reason into a
          multiplicity of many-sided <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page236">[pg 236]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg236"></a> phenomena, is unessential to the Idea, lies
          merely in the kind of knowledge that belongs to the individual and
          has reality only for this. The same thing necessarily holds good of
          the unfolding of that Idea which is the completest objectivity of
          will. Therefore, the history of the human race, the throng of
          events, the change of times, the multifarious forms of human life
          in different lands and countries, all this is only the accidental
          form of the manifestation of the Idea, does not belong to the Idea
          itself, in which alone lies the adequate objectivity of the will,
          but only to the phenomenon which appears in the knowledge of the
          individual, and is just as foreign, unessential, and indifferent to
          the Idea itself as the figures which they assume are to the clouds,
          the form of its eddies and foam-flakes to the brook, or its trees
          and flowers to the ice.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To him who has
          thoroughly grasped this, and can distinguish between the will and
          the Idea, and between the Idea and its manifestation, the events of
          the world will have significance only so far as they are the
          letters out of which we may read the Idea of man, but not in and
          for themselves. He will not believe with the vulgar that time may
          produce something actually new and significant; that through it, or
          in it, something absolutely real may attain to existence, or indeed
          that it itself as a whole has beginning and end, plan and
          development, and in some way has for its final aim the highest
          perfection (according to their conception) of the last generation
          of man, whose life is a brief thirty years. Therefore he will just
          as little, with Homer, people a whole Olympus with gods to guide
          the events of time, as, with Ossian, he will take the forms of the
          clouds for individual beings; for, as we have said, both have just
          as much meaning as regards the Idea which appears in them. In the
          manifold forms of human life and in the unceasing change of events,
          he will regard the Idea only as the abiding and essential, in which
          the will to live has its fullest objectivity, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page237">[pg 237]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg237"></a> and which shows its different sides in
          the capacities, the passions, the errors and the excellences of the
          human race; in self-interest, hatred, love, fear, boldness,
          frivolity, stupidity, slyness, wit, genius, and so forth, all of
          which crowding together and combining in thousands of forms
          (individuals), continually create the history of the great and the
          little world, in which it is all the same whether they are set in
          motion by nuts or by crowns. Finally, he will find that in the
          world it is the same as in the dramas of Gozzi, in all of which the
          same persons appear, with like intention, and with a like fate; the
          motives and incidents are certainly different in each piece, but
          the spirit of the incidents is the same; the actors in one piece
          know nothing of the incidents of another, although they performed
          in it themselves; therefore, after all experience of former pieces,
          Pantaloon has become no more agile or generous, Tartaglia no more
          conscientious, Brighella no more courageous, and Columbine no more
          modest.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Suppose we were
          allowed for once a clearer glance into the kingdom of the possible,
          and over the whole chain of causes and effects; if the earth-spirit
          appeared and showed us in a picture all the greatest men,
          enlighteners of the world, and heroes, that chance destroyed before
          they were ripe for their work; then the great events that would
          have changed the history of the world and brought in periods of the
          highest culture and enlightenment, but which the blindest chance,
          the most insignificant accident, hindered at the outset; lastly,
          the splendid powers of great men, that would have enriched whole
          ages of the world, but which, either misled by error or passion, or
          compelled by necessity, they squandered uselessly on unworthy or
          unfruitful objects, or even wasted in play. If we saw all this, we
          would shudder and lament at the thought of the lost treasures of
          whole periods of the world. But the earth-spirit would smile and
          say, <span class="tei tei-q">“The source from which the individuals
          and their powers <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page238">[pg

          proceed is inexhaustible and unending as time and space; for, like
          these forms of all phenomena, they also are only phenomena,
          visibility of the will. No finite measure can exhaust that infinite
          source; therefore an undiminished eternity is always open for the
          return of any event or work that was nipped in the bud. In this
          world of phenomena true loss is just as little possible as true
          gain. The will alone is; it is the thing in-itself, and the source
          of all these phenomena. Its self-knowledge and its assertion or
          denial, which is then decided upon, is the only event
          in-itself.”</span><a href="#note_49" id="noteref_49" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">49</span></span></a></p>

          follows the thread of events; it is pragmatic so far as it deduces

          knowledge. At the lowest grades of its objectivity, where it still
          acts without knowledge, natural science, in the form of etiology,
          treats of the laws of the changes of its phenomena, and, in the
          form of morphology, of what is permanent in them. This almost
          endless task is lightened by the aid of concepts, which comprehend
          what is general in order that we may deduce what is particular from
          it. Lastly, mathematics treats of the mere forms, time and space,
          in which the Ideas, broken up into multiplicity, appear for the
          knowledge of the subject as individual. All these, of which the
          common name is science, proceed according to the principle of
          sufficient reason in its different forms, and their theme is always
          the phenomenon, its laws, connections, and the relations which
          result from them. But what kind of knowledge is concerned with that
          which is outside and independent of all relations, that which alone
          is really essential to the world, the true content of its
          phenomena, that which is subject to no change, and therefore is
          known with equal truth for all time, in a word, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ideas</span></em>,
          which are the direct and adequate objectivity <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page239">[pg 239]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg239"></a> of the thing in-itself, the will? We
          answer, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Art</span></em>, the work of genius. It
          repeats or reproduces the eternal Ideas grasped through pure
          contemplation, the essential and abiding in all the phenomena of
          the world; and according to what the material is in which it
          reproduces, it is sculpture or painting, poetry or music. Its one
          source is the knowledge of Ideas; its one aim the communication of
          this knowledge. While science, following the unresting and
          inconstant stream of the fourfold forms of reason and consequent,
          with each end attained sees further, and can never reach a final
          goal nor attain full satisfaction, any more than by running we can
          reach the place where the clouds touch the horizon; art, on the
          contrary, is everywhere at its goal. For it plucks the object of
          its contemplation out of the stream of the world's course, and has
          it isolated before it. And this particular thing, which in that
          stream was a small perishing part, becomes to art the
          representative of the whole, an equivalent of the endless multitude
          in space and time. It therefore pauses at this particular thing;
          the course of time stops; the relations vanish for it; only the
          essential, the Idea, is its object. We may, therefore, accurately
          define it as the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">way of viewing things independent of the
          principle of sufficient reason</span></em>, in opposition to the
          way of viewing them which proceeds in accordance with that
          principle, and which is the method of experience and of science.
          This last method of considering things may be compared to a line
          infinitely extended in a horizontal direction, and the former to a
          vertical line which cuts it at any point. The method of viewing
          things which proceeds in accordance with the principle of
          sufficient reason is the rational method, and it alone is valid and
          of use in practical life and in science. The method which looks
          away from the content of this principle is the method of genius,
          which is only valid and of use in art. The first is the method of
          Aristotle; the second is, on the whole, that of Plato. The first is
          like <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page240">[pg 240]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg240"></a> the mighty storm,
          that rushes along without beginning and without aim, bending,
          agitating, and carrying away everything before it; the second is
          like the silent sunbeam, that pierces through the storm quite
          unaffected by it. The first is like the innumerable showering drops
          of the waterfall, which, constantly changing, never rest for an
          instant; the second is like the rainbow, quietly resting on this
          raging torrent. Only through the pure contemplation described
          above, which ends entirely in the object, can Ideas be
          comprehended; and the nature of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">genius</span></em>
          consists in pre-eminent capacity for such contemplation. Now, as
          this requires that a man should entirely forget himself and the
          relations in which he stands, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">genius</span></em> is simply the completest
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">objectivity</span></em>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          the objective tendency of the mind, as opposed to the subjective,
          which is directed to one's own self—in other words, to the will.
          Thus genius is the faculty of continuing in the state of pure
          perception, of losing oneself in perception, and of enlisting in
          this service the knowledge which originally existed only for the
          service of the will; that is to say, genius is the power of leaving
          one's own interests, wishes, and aims entirely out of sight, thus
          of entirely renouncing one's own personality for a time, so as to
          remain <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pure knowing subject</span></em>, clear vision
          of the world; and this not merely at moments, but for a sufficient
          length of time, and with sufficient consciousness, to enable one to
          reproduce by deliberate art what has thus been apprehended, and
          <span class="tei tei-q">“to fix in lasting thoughts the wavering
          images that float before the mind.”</span> It is as if, when genius
          appears in an individual, a far larger measure of the power of
          knowledge falls to his lot than is necessary for the service of an
          individual will; and this superfluity of knowledge, being free, now
          becomes subject purified from will, a clear mirror of the inner
          nature of the world. This explains the activity, amounting even to
          disquietude, of men of genius, for the present can seldom satisfy
          them, because it does not fill their consciousness. This gives
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page241">[pg 241]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg241"></a> them that restless
          aspiration, that unceasing desire for new things, and for the
          contemplation of lofty things, and also that longing that is hardly
          ever satisfied, for men of similar nature and of like stature, to
          whom they might communicate themselves; whilst the common mortal,
          entirely filled and satisfied by the common present, ends in it,
          and finding everywhere his like, enjoys that peculiar satisfaction
          in daily life that is denied to genius.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Imagination has
          rightly been recognised as an essential element of genius; it has
          sometimes even been regarded as identical with it; but this is a
          mistake. As the objects of genius are the eternal Ideas, the
          permanent, essential forms of the world and all its phenomena, and
          as the knowledge of the Idea is necessarily knowledge through
          perception, is not abstract, the knowledge of the genius would be
          limited to the Ideas of the objects actually present to his person,
          and dependent upon the chain of circumstances that brought these
          objects to him, if his imagination did not extend his horizon far
          beyond the limits of his actual personal existence, and thus enable
          him to construct the whole out of the little that comes into his
          own actual apperception, and so to let almost all possible scenes
          of life pass before him in his own consciousness. Further, the
          actual objects are almost always very imperfect copies of the Ideas
          expressed in them; therefore the man of genius requires imagination
          in order to see in things, not that which Nature has actually made,
          but that which she endeavoured to make, yet could not because of
          that conflict of her forms among themselves which we referred to in
          the last book. We shall return to this farther on in treating of
          sculpture. The imagination then extends the intellectual horizon of
          the man of genius beyond the objects which actually present
          themselves to him, both as regards quality and quantity. Therefore
          extraordinary strength of imagination accompanies, and is indeed a
          necessary condition of genius. But the converse does not hold, for
          strength of imagination <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page242">[pg
          242]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg242"></a>
          does not indicate genius; on the contrary, men who have no touch of
          genius may have much imagination. For as it is possible to consider
          a real object in two opposite ways, purely objectively, the way of
          genius grasping its Idea, or in the common way, merely in the
          relations in which it stands to other objects and to one's own
          will, in accordance with the principle of sufficient reason, it is
          also possible to perceive an imaginary object in both of these
          ways. Regarded in the first way, it is a means to the knowledge of
          the Idea, the communication of which is the work of art; in the
          second case, the imaginary object is used to build castles in the
          air congenial to egotism and the individual humour, and which for
          the moment delude and gratify; thus only the relations of the
          phantasies so linked together are known. The man who indulges in
          such an amusement is a dreamer; he will easily mingle those fancies
          that delight his solitude with reality, and so unfit himself for
          real life: perhaps he will write them down, and then we shall have
          the ordinary novel of every description, which entertains those who
          are like him and the public at large, for the readers imagine
          themselves in the place of the hero, and then find the story very
          agreeable.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The common
          mortal, that manufacture of Nature which she produces by the
          thousand every day, is, as we have said, not capable, at least not
          continuously so, of observation that in every sense is wholly
          disinterested, as sensuous contemplation, strictly so called, is.
          He can turn his attention to things only so far as they have some
          relation to his will, however indirect it may be. Since in this
          respect, which never demands anything but the knowledge of
          relations, the abstract conception of the thing is sufficient, and
          for the most part even better adapted for use; the ordinary man
          does not linger long over the mere perception, does not fix his
          attention long on one object, but in all that is presented to him
          hastily seeks merely the concept under which it is to be brought,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page243">[pg 243]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg243"></a> as the lazy man
          seeks a chair, and then it interests him no further. This is why he
          is so soon done with everything, with works of art, objects of
          natural beauty, and indeed everywhere with the truly significant
          contemplation of all the scenes of life. He does not linger; only
          seeks to know his own way in life, together with all that might at
          any time become his way. Thus he makes topographical notes in the
          widest sense; over the consideration of life itself as such he
          wastes no time. The man of genius, on the other hand, whose
          excessive power of knowledge frees it at times from the service of
          will, dwells on the consideration of life itself, strives to
          comprehend the Idea of each thing, not its relations to other
          things; and in doing this he often forgets to consider his own path
          in life, and therefore for the most part pursues it awkwardly
          enough. While to the ordinary man his faculty of knowledge is a
          lamp to lighten his path, to the man of genius it is the sun which
          reveals the world. This great diversity in their way of looking at
          life soon becomes visible in the outward appearance both of the man
          of genius and of the ordinary mortal. The man in whom genius lives
          and works is easily distinguished by his glance, which is both keen
          and steady, and bears the stamp of perception, of contemplation.
          This is easily seen from the likenesses of the few men of genius
          whom Nature has produced here and there among countless millions.
          On the other hand, in the case of an ordinary man, the true object
          of his contemplation, what he is prying into, can be easily seen
          from his glance, if indeed it is not quite stupid and vacant, as is
          generally the case. Therefore the expression of genius in a face
          consists in this, that in it a decided predominance of knowledge
          over will is visible, and consequently there also shows itself in
          it a knowledge that is entirely devoid of relation to will,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pure
          knowing</span></em>. On the contrary, in ordinary countenances
          there is a predominant expression of will; and we see that
          knowledge only comes into activity under <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page244">[pg 244]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg244"></a> the impulse of will, and thus is directed
          merely by motives.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Since the
          knowledge that pertains to genius, or the knowledge of Ideas, is
          that knowledge which does not follow the principle of sufficient
          reason, so, on the other hand, the knowledge which does follow that
          principle is that which gives us prudence and rationality in life,
          and which creates the sciences. Thus men of genius are affected
          with the deficiencies entailed in the neglect of this latter kind
          of knowledge. Yet what I say in this regard is subject to the
          limitation that it only concerns them in so far as and while they
          are actually engaged in that kind of knowledge which is peculiar to
          genius; and this is by no means at every moment of their lives, for
          the great though spontaneous exertion which is demanded for the
          comprehension of Ideas free from will must necessarily relax, and
          there are long intervals during which men of genius are placed in
          very much the same position as ordinary mortals, both as regards
          advantages and deficiencies. On this account the action of genius
          has always been regarded as an inspiration, as indeed the name
          indicates, as the action of a superhuman being distinct from the
          individual himself, and which takes possession of him only
          periodically. The disinclination of men of genius to direct their
          attention to the content of the principle of sufficient reason will
          first show itself, with regard to the ground of being, as dislike
          of mathematics; for its procedure is based upon the most universal
          forms of the phenomenon space and time, which are themselves merely
          modes of the principle of sufficient reason, and is consequently
          precisely the opposite of that method of thought which seeks merely
          the content of the phenomenon, the Idea which expresses itself in
          it apart from all relations. The logical method of mathematics is
          also antagonistic to genius, for it does not satisfy but obstructs
          true insight, and presents merely a chain of conclusions in
          accordance with the principle of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page245">[pg 245]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg245"></a> the ground of knowing. The mental faculty
          upon which it makes the greatest claim is memory, for it is
          necessary to recollect all the earlier propositions which are
          referred to. Experience has also proved that men of great artistic
          genius have no faculty for mathematics; no man was ever very
          distinguished for both. Alfieri relates that he was never able to
          understand the fourth proposition of Euclid. Goethe was constantly
          reproached with his want of mathematical knowledge by the ignorant
          opponents of his theory of colours. Here certainly, where it was
          not a question of calculation and measurement upon hypothetical
          data, but of direct knowledge by the understanding of causes and
          effects, this reproach was so utterly absurd and inappropriate,
          that by making it they have exposed their entire want of judgment,
          just as much as by the rest of their ridiculous arguments. The fact
          that up to the present day, nearly half a century after the
          appearance of Goethe's theory of colours, even in Germany the
          Newtonian fallacies still have undisturbed possession of the
          professorial chair, and men continue to speak quite seriously of
          the seven homogeneous rays of light and their different
          refrangibility, will some day be numbered among the great
          intellectual peculiarities of men generally, and especially of
          Germans. From the same cause as we have referred to above, may be
          explained the equally well-known fact that, conversely, admirable
          mathematicians have very little susceptibility for works of fine
          art. This is very naïvely expressed in the well-known anecdote of
          the French mathematician, who, after having read Racine's
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Iphigenia,”</span> shrugged his shoulders
          and asked, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">Qu'est ce que cela
          prouve?</span></span>”</span> Further, as quick comprehension of
          relations in accordance with the laws of causality and motivation
          is what specially constitutes prudence or sagacity, a prudent man,
          so far as and while he is so, will not be a genius, and a man of
          genius, so far as and while he is so, will not be a prudent man.
          Lastly, perceptive knowledge generally, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page246">[pg 246]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg246"></a> in the province of which the Idea always
          lies, is directly opposed to rational or abstract knowledge, which
          is guided by the principle of the ground of knowing. It is also
          well known that we seldom find great genius united with pre-eminent
          reasonableness; on the contrary, persons of genius are often
          subject to violent emotions and irrational passions. But the ground
          of this is not weakness of reason, but partly unwonted energy of
          that whole phenomenon of will—the man of genius—which expresses
          itself through the violence of all his acts of will, and partly
          preponderance of the knowledge of perception through the senses and
          understanding over abstract knowledge, producing a decided tendency
          to the perceptible, the exceedingly lively impressions of which so
          far outshine colourless concepts, that they take their place in the
          guidance of action, which consequently becomes irrational.
          Accordingly the impression of the present moment is very strong
          with such persons, and carries them away into unconsidered action,
          violent emotions and passions. Moreover, since, in general, the
          knowledge of persons of genius has to some extent freed itself from
          the service of will, they will not in conversation think so much of
          the person they are addressing as of the thing they are speaking
          about, which is vividly present to them; and therefore they are
          likely to judge or narrate things too objectively for their own
          interests; they will not pass over in silence what would more
          prudently be concealed, and so forth. Finally, they are given to
          soliloquising, and in general may exhibit certain weaknesses which
          are actually akin to madness. It has often been remarked that there
          is a side at which genius and madness touch, and even pass over
          into each other, and indeed poetical inspiration has been called a
          kind of madness: <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">amabilis
          insania</span></span>, Horace calls it (Od. iii. 4), and Wieland in
          the introduction to <span class="tei tei-q">“Oberon”</span> speaks
          of it as <span class="tei tei-q">“amiable madness.”</span> Even
          Aristotle, as quoted by Seneca (De Tranq. Animi, 15, 16), is
          reported to have <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page247">[pg
          247]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg247"></a>
          said: <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Nullum magnum ingenium sine
          mixtura dementiæ fuit</span></span>. Plato expresses it in the
          figure of the dark cave, referred to above (De Rep. 7), when he
          says: <span class="tei tei-q">“Those who, outside the cave, have
          seen the true sunlight and the things that have true being (Ideas),
          cannot afterwards see properly down in the cave, because their eyes
          are not accustomed to the darkness; they cannot distinguish the
          shadows, and are jeered at for their mistakes by those who have
          never left the cave and its shadows.”</span> In the <span class="tei tei-q">“Phædrus”</span> also (p. 317), he distinctly says that
          there can be no true poet without a certain madness; in fact, (p.
          327), that every one appears mad who recognises the eternal Ideas
          in fleeting things. Cicero also quotes: <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Negat enim sine furore, Democritus, quemquam
          poetam magnum esse posse; quod idem dicit Plato</span></span> (De
          Divin., i. 37). And, lastly, Pope says—</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Especially
          instructive in this respect is Goethe's <span class="tei tei-q">“Torquato Tasso,”</span> in which he shows us not only
          the suffering, the martyrdom of genius as such, but also how it
          constantly passes into madness. Finally, the fact of the direct
          connection of genius and madness is established by the biographies
          of great men of genius, such as Rousseau, Byron, and Alfieri, and
          by anecdotes from the lives of others. On the other hand, I must
          mention that, by a diligent search in lunatic asylums, I have found
          individual cases of patients who were unquestionably endowed with
          great talents, and whose genius distinctly appeared through their
          madness, which, however, had completely gained the upper hand. Now
          this cannot be ascribed to chance, for on the one hand the number
          of mad persons is relatively very small, and on the other hand a
          person of genius is a phenomenon which is rare beyond all ordinary
          estimation, and only appears in nature as the greatest exception.
          It will be sufficient to convince us of this if we compare the
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page248">[pg 248]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg248"></a> number of really
          great men of genius that the whole of civilised Europe has
          produced, both in ancient and modern times, with the two hundred
          and fifty millions who are always living in Europe, and who change
          entirely every thirty years. In estimating the number of men of
          outstanding genius, we must of course only count those who have
          produced works which have retained through all time an enduring
          value for mankind. I shall not refrain from mentioning, that I have
          known some persons of decided, though not remarkable, mental
          superiority, who also showed a slight trace of insanity. It might
          seem from this that every advance of intellect beyond the ordinary
          measure, as an abnormal development, disposes to madness. In the
          meantime, however, I will explain as briefly as possible my view of
          the purely intellectual ground of the relation between genius and
          madness, for this will certainly assist the explanation of the real
          nature of genius, that is to say, of that mental endowment which
          alone can produce genuine works of art. But this necessitates a
          brief explanation of madness itself.<a href="#note_50" id="noteref_50" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">50</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A clear and
          complete insight into the nature of madness, a correct and distinct
          conception of what constitutes the difference between the sane and
          the insane, has, as far as I know, not as yet been found. Neither
          reason nor understanding can be denied to madmen, for they talk and
          understand, and often draw very accurate conclusions; they also, as
          a rule, perceive what is present quite correctly, and apprehend the
          connection between cause and effect. Visions, like the phantasies
          of delirium, are no ordinary symptom of madness: delirium falsifies
          perception, madness the thoughts. For the most part, madmen do not
          err in the knowledge of what is immediately <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">present</span></em>; their raving always
          relates to what is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">absent</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">past</span></em>,
          and only through these to their connection with what is present.
          Therefore it seems to me that <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page249">[pg 249]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg249"></a> their malady specially concerns the memory;
          not indeed that memory fails them entirely, for many of them know a
          great deal by heart, and sometimes recognise persons whom they have
          not seen for a long time; but rather that the thread of memory is
          broken, the continuity of its connection destroyed, and no
          uniformly connected recollection of the past is possible.
          Particular scenes of the past are known correctly, just like the
          particular present; but there are gaps in their recollection which
          they fill up with fictions, and these are either always the same,
          in which case they become fixed ideas, and the madness that results
          is called monomania or melancholy; or they are always different,
          momentary fancies, and then it is called folly, <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">fatuitas</span></span>. This is why it is so
          difficult to find out their former life from lunatics when they
          enter an asylum. The true and the false are always mixed up in
          their memory. Although the immediate present is correctly known, it
          becomes falsified through its fictitious connection with an
          imaginary past; they therefore regard themselves and others as
          identical with persons who exist only in their imaginary past; they
          do not recognise some of their acquaintances at all, and thus while
          they perceive correctly what is actually present, they have only
          false conceptions of its relations to what is absent. If the
          madness reaches a high degree, there is complete absence of memory,
          so that the madman is quite incapable of any reference to what is
          absent or past, and is only determined by the caprice of the moment
          in connection with the fictions which, in his mind, fill the past.
          In such a case, we are never for a moment safe from violence or
          murder, unless we constantly make the madman aware of the presence
          of superior force. The knowledge of the madman has this in common
          with that of the brute, both are confined to the present. What
          distinguishes them is that the brute has really no idea of the past
          as such, though the past acts upon it through the medium of custom,
          so that, for example, the dog <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page250">[pg 250]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg250"></a> recognises its former master even after
          years, that is to say, it receives the wonted impression at the
          sight of him; but of the time that has passed since it saw him it
          has no recollection. The madman, on the other hand, always carries
          about in his reason an abstract past, but it is a false past, which
          exists only for him, and that either constantly, or only for the
          moment. The influence of this false past prevents the use of the
          true knowledge of the present which the brute is able to make. The
          fact that violent mental suffering or unexpected and terrible
          calamities should often produce madness, I explain in the following
          manner. All such suffering is as an actual event confined to the
          present. It is thus merely transitory, and is consequently never
          excessively heavy; it only becomes unendurably great when it is
          lasting pain; but as such it exists only in thought, and therefore
          lies in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">memory</span></em>. If now such a sorrow, such
          painful knowledge or reflection, is so bitter that it becomes
          altogether unbearable, and the individual is prostrated under it,
          then, terrified Nature seizes upon <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">madness</span></em>
          as the last resource of life; the mind so fearfully tortured at
          once destroys the thread of its memory, fills up the gaps with
          fictions, and thus seeks refuge in madness from the mental
          suffering that exceeds its strength, just as we cut off a mortified
          limb and replace it with a wooden one. The distracted Ajax, King
          Lear, and Ophelia may be taken as examples; for the creations of
          true genius, to which alone we can refer here, as universally
          known, are equal in truth to real persons; besides, in this case,
          frequent actual experience shows the same thing. A faint analogy of
          this kind of transition from pain to madness is to be found in the
          way in which all of us often seek, as it were mechanically, to
          drive away a painful thought that suddenly occurs to us by some
          loud exclamation or quick movement—to turn ourselves from it, to
          distract our minds by force.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We see, from
          what has been said, that the madman has <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page251">[pg 251]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg251"></a> a true knowledge of what is actually present,
          and also of certain particulars of the past, but that he mistakes
          the connection, the relations, and therefore falls into error and
          talks nonsense. Now this is exactly the point at which he comes
          into contact with the man of genius; for he also leaves out of
          sight the knowledge of the connection of things, since he neglects
          that knowledge of relations which conforms to the principle of
          sufficient reason, in order to see in things only their Ideas, and
          to seek to comprehend their true nature, which manifests itself to
          perception, and in regard to which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one
          thing</span></em> represents its whole species, in which way, as
          Goethe says, one case is valid for a thousand. The particular
          object of his contemplation, or the present which is perceived by
          him with extraordinary vividness, appear in so strong a light that
          the other links of the chain to which they belong are at once
          thrown into the shade, and this gives rise to phenomena which have
          long been recognised as resembling those of madness. That which in
          particular given things exists only incompletely and weakened by
          modifications, is raised by the man of genius, through his way of
          contemplating it, to the Idea of the thing, to completeness: he
          therefore sees everywhere extremes, and therefore his own action
          tends to extremes; he cannot hit the mean, he lacks soberness, and
          the result is what we have said. He knows the Ideas completely but
          not the individuals. Therefore it has been said that a poet may
          know mankind deeply and thoroughly, and may yet have a very
          imperfect knowledge of men. He is easily deceived, and is a tool in
          the hands of the crafty.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 37. Genius,
          then, consists, according to our explanation, in the capacity for
          knowing, independently of the principle of sufficient reason, not
          individual things, which have their existence only in their
          relations, but the Ideas of such things, and of being oneself the
          correlative of the Idea, and thus no longer an individual, but the
          pure subject of knowledge. Yet this faculty must exist in all
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page252">[pg 252]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg252"></a> men in a smaller and
          different degree; for if not, they would be just as incapable of
          enjoying works of art as of producing them; they would have no
          susceptibility for the beautiful or the sublime; indeed, these
          words could have no meaning for them. We must therefore assume that
          there exists in all men this power of knowing the Ideas in things,
          and consequently of transcending their personality for the moment,
          unless indeed there are some men who are capable of no æsthetic
          pleasure at all. The man of genius excels ordinary men only by
          possessing this kind of knowledge in a far higher degree and more
          continuously. Thus, while under its influence he retains the
          presence of mind which is necessary to enable him to repeat in a
          voluntary and intentional work what he has learned in this manner;
          and this repetition is the work of art. Through this he
          communicates to others the Idea he has grasped. This Idea remains
          unchanged and the same, so that æsthetic pleasure is one and the
          same whether it is called forth by a work of art or directly by the
          contemplation of nature and life. The work of art is only a means
          of facilitating the knowledge in which this pleasure consists. That
          the Idea comes to us more easily from the work of art than directly
          from nature and the real world, arises from the fact that the
          artist, who knew only the Idea, no longer the actual, has
          reproduced in his work the pure Idea, has abstracted it from the
          actual, omitting all disturbing accidents. The artist lets us see
          the world through his eyes. That he has these eyes, that he knows
          the inner nature of things apart from all their relations, is the
          gift of genius, is inborn; but that he is able to lend us this
          gift, to let us see with his eyes, is acquired, and is the
          technical side of art. Therefore, after the account which I have
          given in the preceding pages of the inner nature of æsthetical
          knowledge in its most general outlines, the following more exact
          philosophical treatment of the beautiful and the sublime will
          explain them both, in nature and in art, without separating
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page253">[pg 253]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg253"></a> them further. First
          of all we shall consider what takes place in a man when he is
          affected by the beautiful and the sublime; whether he derives this
          emotion directly from nature, from life, or partakes of it only
          through the medium of art, does not make any essential, but merely
          an external, difference.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Section_38"></a> § 38. In
          the æsthetical mode of contemplation we have found <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">two inseparable
          constituent parts</span></em>—the knowledge of the object, not as
          individual thing but as Platonic Idea, that is, as the enduring
          form of this whole species of things; and the self-consciousness of
          the knowing person, not as individual, but as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pure will-less
          subject of knowledge</span></em>. The condition under which both
          these constituent parts appear always united was found to be the
          abandonment of the method of knowing which is bound to the
          principle of sufficient reason, and which, on the other hand, is
          the only kind of knowledge that is of value for the service of the
          will and also for science. Moreover, we shall see that the pleasure
          which is produced by the contemplation of the beautiful arises from
          these two constituent parts, sometimes more from the one, sometimes
          more from the other, according to what the object of the æsthetical
          contemplation may be.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">willing</span></em>
          arises from want, therefore from deficiency, and therefore from
          suffering. The satisfaction of a wish ends it; yet for one wish
          that is satisfied there remain at least ten which are denied.
          Further, the desire lasts long, the demands are infinite; the
          satisfaction is short and scantily measured out. But even the final
          satisfaction is itself only apparent; every satisfied wish at once
          makes room for a new one; both are illusions; the one is known to
          be so, the other not yet. No attained object of desire can give
          lasting satisfaction, but merely a fleeting gratification; it is
          like the alms thrown to the beggar, that keeps him alive to-day
          that his misery may be prolonged till the morrow. Therefore, so
          long as our consciousness is filled by our will, so long as we are
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page254">[pg 254]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg254"></a> given up to the
          throng of desires with their constant hopes and fears, so long as
          we are the subject of willing, we can never have lasting happiness
          nor peace. It is essentially all the same whether we pursue or
          flee, fear injury or seek enjoyment; the care for the constant
          demands of the will, in whatever form it may be, continually
          occupies and sways the consciousness; but without peace no true
          well-being is possible. The subject of willing is thus constantly
          stretched on the revolving wheel of Ixion, pours water into the
          sieve of the Danaids, is the ever-longing Tantalus.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But when some
          external cause or inward disposition lifts us suddenly out of the
          endless stream of willing, delivers knowledge from the slavery of
          the will, the attention is no longer directed to the motives of
          willing, but comprehends things free from their relation to the
          will, and thus observes them without personal interest, without
          subjectivity, purely objectively, gives itself entirely up to them
          so far as they are ideas, but not in so far as they are motives.
          Then all at once the peace which we were always seeking, but which
          always fled from us on the former path of the desires, comes to us
          of its own accord, and it is well with us. It is the painless state
          which Epicurus prized as the highest good and as the state of the
          gods; for we are for the moment set free from the miserable
          striving of the will; we keep the Sabbath of the penal servitude of
          willing; the wheel of Ixion stands still.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But this is just
          the state which I described above as necessary for the knowledge of
          the Idea, as pure contemplation, as sinking oneself in perception,
          losing oneself in the object, forgetting all individuality,
          surrendering that kind of knowledge which follows the principle of
          sufficient reason, and comprehends only relations; the state by
          means of which at once and inseparably the perceived particular
          thing is raised to the Idea of its whole species, and the knowing
          individual to the pure subject of will-less <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page255">[pg 255]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg255"></a> knowledge, and as such they are both
          taken out of the stream of time and all other relations. It is then
          all one whether we see the sun set from the prison or from the
          palace.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Inward
          disposition, the predominance of knowing over willing, can produce
          this state under any circumstances. This is shown by those
          admirable Dutch artists who directed this purely objective
          perception to the most insignificant objects, and established a
          lasting monument of their objectivity and spiritual peace in their
          pictures of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">still life</span></em>, which the æsthetic
          beholder does not look on without emotion; for they present to him
          the peaceful, still, frame of mind of the artist, free from will,
          which was needed to contemplate such insignificant things so
          objectively, to observe them so attentively, and to repeat this
          perception so intelligently; and as the picture enables the
          onlooker to participate in this state, his emotion is often
          increased by the contrast between it and the unquiet frame of mind,
          disturbed by vehement willing, in which he finds himself. In the
          same spirit, landscape-painters, and particularly Ruisdael, have
          often painted very insignificant country scenes, which produce the
          same effect even more agreeably.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All this is
          accomplished by the inner power of an artistic nature alone; but
          that purely objective disposition is facilitated and assisted from
          without by suitable objects, by the abundance of natural beauty
          which invites contemplation, and even presses itself upon us.
          Whenever it discloses itself suddenly to our view, it almost always
          succeeds in delivering us, though it may be only for a moment, from
          subjectivity, from the slavery of the will, and in raising us to
          the state of pure knowing. This is why the man who is tormented by
          passion, or want, or care, is so suddenly revived, cheered, and
          restored by a single free glance into nature: the storm of passion,
          the pressure of desire and fear, and all the miseries of willing
          are then at once, and in a marvellous manner, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page256">[pg 256]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg256"></a> calmed and appeased. For at the moment
          at which, freed from the will, we give ourselves up to pure
          will-less knowing, we pass into a world from which everything is
          absent that influenced our will and moved us so violently through
          it. This freeing of knowledge lifts us as wholly and entirely away
          from all that, as do sleep and dreams; happiness and unhappiness
          have disappeared; we are no longer individual; the individual is
          forgotten; we are only pure subject of knowledge; we are only that
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> eye of the world which looks
          out from all knowing creatures, but which can become perfectly free
          from the service of will in man alone. Thus all difference of
          individuality so entirely disappears, that it is all the same
          whether the perceiving eye belongs to a mighty king or to a
          wretched beggar; for neither joy nor complaining can pass that
          boundary with us. So near us always lies a sphere in which we
          escape from all our misery; but who has the strength to continue
          long in it? As soon as any single relation to our will, to our
          person, even of these objects of our pure contemplation, comes
          again into consciousness, the magic is at an end; we fall back into
          the knowledge which is governed by the principle of sufficient
          reason; we know no longer the Idea, but the particular thing, the
          link of a chain to which we also belong, and we are again abandoned
          to all our woe. Most men remain almost always at this standpoint
          because they entirely lack objectivity, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          genius. Therefore they have no pleasure in being alone with nature;
          they need company, or at least a book. For their knowledge remains
          subject to their will; they seek, therefore, in objects, only some
          relation to their will, and whenever they see anything that has no
          such relation, there sounds within them, like a ground bass in
          music, the constant inconsolable cry, <span class="tei tei-q">“It
          is of no use to me;”</span> thus in solitude the most beautiful
          surroundings have for them a desolate, dark, strange, and hostile
          appearance.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lastly, it is
          this blessedness of will-less perception <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page257">[pg 257]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg257"></a> which casts an enchanting glamour over the
          past and distant, and presents them to us in so fair a light by
          means of self-deception. For as we think of days long gone by, days
          in which we lived in a distant place, it is only the objects which
          our fancy recalls, not the subject of will, which bore about with
          it then its incurable sorrows just as it bears them now; but they
          are forgotten, because since then they have often given place to
          others. Now, objective perception acts with regard to what is
          remembered just as it would in what is present, if we let it have
          influence over us, if we surrendered ourselves to it free from
          will. Hence it arises that, especially when we are more than
          ordinarily disturbed by some want, the remembrance of past and
          distant scenes suddenly flits across our minds like a lost
          paradise. The fancy recalls only what was objective, not what was
          individually subjective, and we imagine that that objective stood
          before us then just as pure and undisturbed by any relation to the
          will as its image stands in our fancy now; while in reality the
          relation of the objects to our will gave us pain then just as it
          does now. We can deliver ourselves from all suffering just as well
          through present objects as through distant ones whenever we raise
          ourselves to a purely objective contemplation of them, and so are
          able to bring about the illusion that only the objects are present
          and not we ourselves. Then, as the pure subject of knowledge, freed
          from the miserable self, we become entirely one with these objects,
          and, for the moment, our wants are as foreign to us as they are to
          them. The world as idea alone remains, and the world as will has
          disappeared.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In all these
          reflections it has been my object to bring out clearly the nature
          and the scope of the subjective element in æsthetic pleasure; the
          deliverance of knowledge from the service of the will, the
          forgetting of self as an individual, and the raising of the
          consciousness to the pure will-less, timeless, subject of
          knowledge, independent <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page258">[pg
          258]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg258"></a>
          of all relations. With this subjective side of æsthetic
          contemplation, there must always appear as its necessary
          correlative the objective side, the intuitive comprehension of the
          Platonic Idea. But before we turn to the closer consideration of
          this, and to the achievements of art in relation to it, it is
          better that we should pause for a little at the subjective side of
          æsthetic pleasure, in order to complete our treatment of this by
          explaining the impression of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sublime</span></em>
          which depends altogether upon it, and arises from a modification of
          it. After that we shall complete our investigation of æsthetic
          pleasure by considering its objective side.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But we must
          first add the following remarks to what has been said. Light is the
          pleasantest and most gladdening of things; it has become the symbol
          of all that is good and salutary. In all religions it symbolises
          salvation, while darkness symbolises damnation. Ormuzd dwells in
          the purest light, Ahrimines in eternal night. Dante's Paradise
          would look very much like Vauxhall in London, for all the blessed
          spirits appear as points of light and arrange themselves in regular
          figures. The very absence of light makes us sad; its return cheers
          us. Colours excite directly a keen delight, which reaches its
          highest degree when they are transparent. All this depends entirely
          upon the fact that light is the correlative and condition of the
          most perfect kind of knowledge of perception, the only knowledge
          which does not in any way affect the will. For sight, unlike the
          affections of the other senses, cannot, in itself, directly and
          through its sensuous effect, make the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sensation</span></em> of the special organ
          agreeable or disagreeable; that is, it has no immediate connection
          with the will. Such a quality can only belong to the perception
          which arises in the understanding, and then it lies in the relation
          of the object to the will. In the case of hearing this is to some
          extent otherwise; sounds can give pain directly, and they may also
          be sensuously agreeable, directly and without regard to
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page259">[pg 259]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg259"></a> harmony or melody.
          Touch, as one with the feeling of the whole body, is still more
          subordinated to this direct influence upon the will; and yet there
          is such a thing as a sensation of touch which is neither painful
          nor pleasant. But smells are always either agreeable or
          disagreeable, and tastes still more so. Thus the last two senses
          are most closely related to the will, and therefore they are always
          the most ignoble, and have been called by Kant the subjective
          senses. The pleasure which we experience from light is in fact only
          the pleasure which arises from the objective possibility of the
          purest and fullest perceptive knowledge, and as such it may be
          traced to the fact that pure knowledge, freed and delivered from
          all will, is in the highest degree pleasant, and of itself
          constitutes a large part of æsthetic enjoyment. Again, we must
          refer to this view of light the incredible beauty which we
          associate with the reflection of objects in water. That lightest,
          quickest, finest species of the action of bodies upon each other,
          that to which we owe by far the completest and purest of our
          perceptions, the action of reflected rays of light, is here brought
          clearly before our eyes, distinct and perfect, in cause and in
          effect, and indeed in its entirety, hence the æsthetic delight it
          gives us, which, in the most important aspect, is entirely based on
          the subjective ground of æsthetic pleasure, and is delight in pure
          knowing and its method.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 39. All these
          reflections are intended to bring out the subjective part of
          æsthetic pleasure; that is to say, that pleasure so far as it
          consists simply of delight in perceptive knowledge as such, in
          opposition to will. And as directly connected with this, there
          naturally follows the explanation of that disposition or frame of
          mind which has been called the sense of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sublime</span></em>.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have already
          remarked above that the transition to the state of pure perception
          takes place most easily when the objects bend themselves to it,
          that is, when by their manifold and yet definite and distinct form
          they easily <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page260">[pg
          260]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg260"></a>
          become representatives of their Ideas, in which beauty, in the
          objective sense, consists. This quality belongs pre-eminently to
          natural beauty, which thus affords even to the most insensible at
          least a fleeting æsthetic satisfaction: indeed it is so remarkable
          how especially the vegetable world invites æsthetic observation,
          and, as it were, presses itself upon it, that one might say, that
          these advances are connected with the fact that these organisms,
          unlike the bodies of animals, are not themselves immediate objects
          of knowledge, and therefore require the assistance of a foreign
          intelligent individual in order to rise out of the world of blind
          will and enter the world of idea, and that thus they long, as it
          were, for this entrance, that they may attain at least indirectly
          what is denied them directly. But I leave this suggestion which I
          have hazarded, and which borders perhaps upon extravagance,
          entirely undecided, for only a very intimate and devoted
          consideration of nature can raise or justify it.<a href="#note_51" id="noteref_51" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">51</span></span></a> As
          long as that which raises us from the knowledge of mere relations
          subject to the will, to æsthetic contemplation, and thereby exalts
          us to the position of the subject of knowledge free from will, is
          this fittingness of nature, this significance and distinctness of
          its forms, on account of which the Ideas individualised in them
          readily present themselves to us; so long is it merely <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">beauty</span></em>
          that affects us and the sense of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">beautiful</span></em> that is excited. But if
          these very objects whose significant forms invite us to pure
          contemplation, have a hostile relation to the human will in
          general, as it exhibits itself in its objectivity, the human body,
          if they are opposed to it, so that it is menaced by the
          irresistible predominance of their power, or sinks into
          insignificance before their immeasurable <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page261">[pg 261]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg261"></a> greatness; if, nevertheless, the beholder
          does not direct his attention to this eminently hostile relation to
          his will, but, although perceiving and recognising it, turns
          consciously away from it, forcibly detaches himself from his will
          and its relations, and, giving himself up entirely to knowledge,
          quietly contemplates those very objects that are so terrible to the
          will, comprehends only their Idea, which is foreign to all
          relation, so that he lingers gladly over its contemplation, and is
          thereby raised above himself, his person, his will, and all
          will:—in that case he is filled with the sense of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sublime</span></em>, he is in the state of
          spiritual exaltation, and therefore the object producing such a
          state is called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sublime</span></em>. Thus what distinguishes
          the sense of the sublime from that of the beautiful is this: in the
          case of the beautiful, pure knowledge has gained the upper hand
          without a struggle, for the beauty of the object, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          that property which facilitates the knowledge of its Idea, has
          removed from consciousness without resistance, and therefore
          imperceptibly, the will and the knowledge of relations which is
          subject to it, so that what is left is the pure subject of
          knowledge without even a remembrance of will. On the other hand, in
          the case of the sublime that state of pure knowledge is only
          attained by a conscious and forcible breaking away from the
          relations of the same object to the will, which are recognised as
          unfavourable, by a free and conscious transcending of the will and
          the knowledge related to it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This exaltation
          must not only be consciously won, but also consciously retained,
          and it is therefore accompanied by a constant remembrance of will;
          yet not of a single particular volition, such as fear or desire,
          but of human volition in general, so far as it is universally
          expressed in its objectivity the human body. If a single real act
          of will were to come into consciousness, through actual personal
          pressure and danger from the object, then the individual will thus
          actually influenced would at once <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page262">[pg 262]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg262"></a> gain the upper hand, the peace of
          contemplation would become impossible, the impression of the
          sublime would be lost, because it yields to the anxiety, in which
          the effort of the individual to right itself has sunk every other
          thought. A few examples will help very much to elucidate this
          theory of the æsthetic sublime and remove all doubt with regard to
          it; at the same time they will bring out the different degrees of
          this sense of the sublime. It is in the main identical with that of
          the beautiful, with pure will-less knowing, and the knowledge, that
          necessarily accompanies it of Ideas out of all relation determined
          by the principle of sufficient reason, and it is distinguished from
          the sense of the beautiful only by the additional quality that it
          rises above the known hostile relation of the object contemplated
          to the will in general. Thus there come to be various degrees of
          the sublime, and transitions from the beautiful to the sublime,
          according as this additional quality is strong, bold, urgent, near,
          or weak, distant, and merely indicated. I think it is more in
          keeping with the plan of my treatise, first to give examples of
          these transitions, and of the weaker degrees of the impression of
          the sublime, although persons whose æsthetical susceptibility in
          general is not very great, and whose imagination is not very
          lively, will only understand the examples given later of the higher
          and more distinct grades of that impression; and they should
          therefore confine themselves to these, and pass over the examples
          of the very weak degrees of the sublime that are to be given
          first.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As man is at
          once impetuous and blind striving of will (whose pole or focus lies
          in the genital organs), and eternal, free, serene subject of pure
          knowing (whose pole is the brain); so, corresponding to this
          antithesis, the sun is both the source of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">light</span></em>,
          the condition of the most perfect kind of knowledge, and therefore
          of the most delightful of things—and the source of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">warmth</span></em>,
          the first condition of life, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, of all phenomena of will
          in its higher grades. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page263">[pg
          263]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg263"></a>
          Therefore, what warmth is for the will, light is for knowledge.
          Light is the largest gem in the crown of beauty, and has the most
          marked influence on the knowledge of every beautiful object. Its
          presence is an indispensable condition of beauty; its favourable
          disposition increases the beauty of the most beautiful.
          Architectural beauty more than any other object is enhanced by
          favourable light, though even the most insignificant things become
          through its influence most beautiful. If, in the dead of winter,
          when all nature is frozen and stiff, we see the rays of the setting
          sun reflected by masses of stone, illuminating without warming, and
          thus favourable only to the purest kind of knowledge, not to the
          will; the contemplation of the beautiful effect of the light upon
          these masses lifts us, as does all beauty, into a state of pure
          knowing. But, in this case, a certain transcending of the interests
          of the will is needed to enable us to rise into the state of pure
          knowing, because there is a faint recollection of the lack of
          warmth from these rays, that is, an absence of the principle of
          life; there is a slight challenge to persist in pure knowing, and
          to refrain from all willing, and therefore it is an example of a
          transition from the sense of the beautiful to that of the sublime.
          It is the faintest trace of the sublime in the beautiful; and
          beauty itself is indeed present only in a slight degree. The
          following is almost as weak an example.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Let us imagine
          ourselves transported to a very lonely place, with unbroken
          horizon, under a cloudless sky, trees and plants in the perfectly
          motionless air, no animals, no men, no running water, the deepest
          silence. Such surroundings are, as it were, a call to seriousness
          and contemplation, apart from all will and its cravings; but this
          is just what imparts to such a scene of desolate stillness a touch
          of the sublime. For, because it affords no object, either
          favourable or unfavourable, for the will which is constantly in
          need of striving and attaining, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page264">[pg 264]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg264"></a> there only remains the state of pure
          contemplation, and whoever is incapable of this, is ignominiously
          abandoned to the vacancy of unoccupied will, and the misery of
          ennui. So far it is a test of our intellectual worth, of which,
          generally speaking, the degree of our power of enduring solitude,
          or our love of it, is a good criterion. The scene we have sketched
          affords us, then, an example of the sublime in a low degree, for in
          it, with the state of pure knowing in its peace and
          all-sufficiency, there is mingled, by way of contrast, the
          recollection of the dependence and poverty of the will which stands
          in need of constant action. This is the species of the sublime for
          which the sight of the boundless prairies of the interior of North
          America is celebrated.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But let us
          suppose such a scene, stripped also of vegetation, and showing only
          naked rocks; then from the entire absence of that organic life
          which is necessary for existence, the will at once becomes uneasy,
          the desert assumes a terrible aspect, our mood becomes more tragic;
          the elevation to the sphere of pure knowing takes place with a more
          decided tearing of ourselves away from the interests of the will;
          and because we persist in continuing in the state of pure knowing,
          the sense of the sublime distinctly appears.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The following
          situation may occasion this feeling in a still higher degree:
          Nature convulsed by a storm; the sky darkened by black threatening
          thunder-clouds; stupendous, naked, overhanging cliffs, completely
          shutting out the view; rushing, foaming torrents; absolute desert;
          the wail of the wind sweeping through the clefts of the rocks. Our
          dependence, our strife with hostile nature, our will broken in the
          conflict, now appears visibly before our eyes. Yet, so long as the
          personal pressure does not gain the upper hand, but we continue in
          æsthetic contemplation, the pure subject of knowing gazes unshaken
          and unconcerned through that strife of nature, through that picture
          of the broken will, and quietly comprehends <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page265">[pg 265]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg265"></a> the Ideas even of those objects which
          are threatening and terrible to the will. In this contrast lies the
          sense of the sublime.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the
          impression becomes still stronger, if, when we have before our
          eyes, on a large scale, the battle of the raging elements, in such
          a scene we are prevented from hearing the sound of our own voice by
          the noise of a falling stream; or, if we are abroad in the storm of
          tempestuous seas, where the mountainous waves rise and fall, dash
          themselves furiously against steep cliffs, and toss their spray
          high into the air; the storm howls, the sea boils, the lightning
          flashes from black clouds, and the peals of thunder drown the voice
          of storm and sea. Then, in the undismayed beholder, the two-fold
          nature of his consciousness reaches the highest degree of
          distinctness. He perceives himself, on the one hand, as an
          individual, as the frail phenomenon of will, which the slightest
          touch of these forces can utterly destroy, helpless against
          powerful nature, dependent, the victim of chance, a vanishing
          nothing in the presence of stupendous might; and, on the other
          hand, as the eternal, peaceful, knowing subject, the condition of
          the object, and, therefore, the supporter of this whole world; the
          terrific strife of nature only his idea; the subject itself free
          and apart from all desires and necessities, in the quiet
          comprehension of the Ideas. This is the complete impression of the
          sublime. Here he obtains a glimpse of a power beyond all comparison
          superior to the individual, threatening it with annihilation.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The impression
          of the sublime may be produced in quite another way, by presenting
          a mere immensity in space and time; its immeasurable greatness
          dwindles the individual to nothing. Adhering to Kant's nomenclature
          and his accurate division, we may call the first kind the
          dynamical, and the second the mathematical sublime, although we
          entirely dissent from his explanation of the inner nature of the
          impression, and can allow no share <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page266">[pg 266]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg266"></a> in it either to moral reflections, or to
          hypostases from scholastic philosophy.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If we lose
          ourselves in the contemplation of the infinite greatness of the
          universe in space and time, meditate on the thousands of years that
          are past or to come, or if the heavens at night actually bring
          before our eyes innumerable worlds and so force upon our
          consciousness the immensity of the universe, we feel ourselves
          dwindle to nothing; as individuals, as living bodies, as transient
          phenomena of will, we feel ourselves pass away and vanish into
          nothing like drops in the ocean. But at once there rises against
          this ghost of our own nothingness, against such lying
          impossibility, the immediate consciousness that all these worlds
          exist only as our idea, only as modifications of the eternal
          subject of pure knowing, which we find ourselves to be as soon as
          we forget our individuality, and which is the necessary supporter
          of all worlds and all times the condition of their possibility. The
          vastness of the world which disquieted us before, rests now in us;
          our dependence upon it is annulled by its dependence upon us. All
          this, however, does not come at once into reflection, but shows
          itself merely as the felt consciousness that in some sense or other
          (which philosophy alone can explain) we are one with the world, and
          therefore not oppressed, but exalted by its immensity. It is the
          felt consciousness of this that the Upanishads of the Vedas
          repeatedly express in such a multitude of different ways; very
          admirably in the saying already quoted: <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Hæ
          omnes creaturæ in totum ego sum, et præter me aliud ens non
          est</span></span> (Oupnek'hat, vol. i. p. 122.) It is the
          transcending of our own individuality, the sense of the
          sublime.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We receive this
          impression of the mathematical-sublime, quite directly, by means of
          a space which is small indeed as compared with the world, but which
          has become directly perceptible to us, and affects us with its
          whole extent in all its three dimensions, so as to make our own
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page267">[pg 267]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg267"></a> body seem almost
          infinitely small. An empty space can never be thus perceived, and
          therefore never an open space, but only space that is directly
          perceptible in all its dimensions by means of the limits which
          enclose it; thus for example a very high, vast dome, like that of
          St. Peter's at Rome, or St. Paul's in London. The sense of the
          sublime here arises through the consciousness of the vanishing
          nothingness of our own body in the presence of a vastness which,
          from another point of view, itself exists only in our idea, and of
          which we are as knowing subject, the supporter. Thus here as
          everywhere it arises from the contrast between the insignificance
          and dependence of ourselves as individuals, as phenomena of will,
          and the consciousness of ourselves as pure subject of knowing. Even
          the vault of the starry heaven produces this if it is contemplated
          without reflection; but just in the same way as the vault of stone,
          and only by its apparent, not its real extent. Some objects of our
          perception excite in us the feeling of the sublime because, not
          only on account of their spatial vastness, but also of their great
          age, that is, their temporal duration, we feel ourselves dwarfed to
          insignificance in their presence, and yet revel in the pleasure of
          contemplating them: of this kind are very high mountains, the
          Egyptian pyramids, and colossal ruins of great antiquity.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Our explanation
          of the sublime applies also to the ethical, to what is called the
          sublime character. Such a character arises from this, that the will
          is not excited by objects which are well calculated to excite it,
          but that knowledge retains the upper hand in their presence. A man
          of sublime character will accordingly consider men in a purely
          objective way, and not with reference to the relations which they
          might have to his will; he will, for example, observe their faults,
          even their hatred and injustice to himself, without being himself
          excited to hatred; he will behold their happiness without envy; he
          will recognise their good qualities without desiring any
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page268">[pg 268]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg268"></a> closer relations
          with them; he will perceive the beauty of women, but he will not
          desire them. His personal happiness or unhappiness will not greatly
          affect him, he will rather be as Hamlet describes Horatio:—</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For in the
          course of his own life and its misfortunes, he will consider less
          his individual lot than that of humanity in general, and will
          therefore conduct himself in its regard, rather as knowing than as
          suffering.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 40. Opposites
          throw light upon each other, and therefore the remark may be in
          place here, that the proper opposite of the sublime is something
          which would not at the first glance be recognised, as such:
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the
          charming</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">attractive</span></em>. By this, however, I
          understand, that which excites the will by presenting to it
          directly its fulfilment, its satisfaction. We saw that the feeling
          of the sublime arises from the fact, that something entirely
          unfavourable to the will, becomes the object of pure contemplation,
          so that such contemplation can only be maintained by persistently
          turning away from the will, and transcending its interests; this
          constitutes the sublimity of the character. The charming or
          attractive, on the contrary, draws the beholder away from the pure
          contemplation which is demanded by all apprehension of the
          beautiful, because it necessarily excites this will, by objects
          which directly appeal to it, and thus he no longer remains pure
          subject of knowing, but becomes the needy and dependent subject of
          will. That every beautiful thing which is bright or cheering should
          be called charming, is the result of a too general concept, which
          arises from a want of accurate discrimination, and which I must
          entirely set aside, and indeed condemn. But in the sense of the
          word which has been given and explained, I <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page269">[pg 269]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg269"></a> find only two species of the charming or
          attractive in the province of art, and both of them are unworthy of
          it. The one species, a very low one, is found in Dutch paintings of
          still life, when they err by representing articles of food, which
          by their deceptive likeness necessarily excite the appetite for the
          things they represent, and this is just an excitement of the will,
          which puts an end to all æsthetic contemplation of the object.
          Painted fruit is yet admissible, because we may regard it as the
          further development of the flower, and as a beautiful product of
          nature in form and colour, without being obliged to think of it as
          eatable; but unfortunately we often find, represented with
          deceptive naturalness, prepared and served dishes, oysters,
          herrings, crabs, bread and butter, beer, wine, and so forth, which
          is altogether to be condemned. In historical painting and in
          sculpture the charming consists in naked figures, whose position,
          drapery, and general treatment are calculated to excite the
          passions of the beholder, and thus pure æsthetical contemplation is
          at once annihilated, and the aim of art is defeated. This mistake
          corresponds exactly to that which we have just censured in the
          Dutch paintings. The ancients are almost always free from this
          fault in their representations of beauty and complete nakedness of
          form, because the artist himself created them in a purely objective
          spirit, filled with ideal beauty, not in the spirit of subjective,
          and base sensuality. The charming is thus everywhere to be avoided
          in art.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is also a
          negative species of the charming or exciting which is even more
          reprehensible than the positive form which has been discussed; this
          is the disgusting or the loathsome. It arouses the will of the
          beholder, just as what is properly speaking charming, and therefore
          disturbs pure æsthetic contemplation. But it is an active aversion
          and opposition which is excited by it; it arouses the will by
          presenting to it objects which it abhors. Therefore it has always
          been recognised that it is <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page270">[pg 270]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg270"></a> altogether inadmissible in art, where even
          what is ugly, when it is not disgusting, is allowable in its proper
          place, as we shall see later.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 41. The course
          of the discussion has made it necessary to insert at this point the
          treatment of the sublime, though we have only half done with the
          beautiful, as we have considered its subjective side only. For it
          was merely a special modification of this subjective side that
          distinguished the beautiful from the sublime. This difference was
          found to depend upon whether the state of pure will-less knowing,
          which is presupposed and demanded by all æsthetic contemplation,
          was reached without opposition, by the mere disappearance of the
          will from consciousness, because the object invited and drew us
          towards it; or whether it was only attained through the free,
          conscious transcending of the will, to which the object
          contemplated had an unfavourable and even hostile relation, which
          would destroy contemplation altogether, if we were to give
          ourselves up to it. This is the distinction between the beautiful
          and the sublime. In the object they are not essentially different,
          for in every case the object of æsthetical contemplation is not the
          individual thing, but the Idea in it which is striving to reveal
          itself; that is to say, adequate objectivity of will at a
          particular grade. Its necessary correlative, independent, like
          itself of the principle of sufficient reason, is the pure subject
          of knowing; just as the correlative of the particular thing is the
          knowing individual, both of which lie within the province of the
          principle of sufficient reason.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When we say that
          a thing is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">beautiful</span></em>, we thereby assert that
          it is an object of our æsthetic contemplation, and this has a
          double meaning; on the one hand it means that the sight of the
          thing makes us <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">objective</span></em>, that is to say, that in
          contemplating it we are no longer conscious of ourselves as
          individuals, but as pure will-less subjects of knowledge; and on
          the other hand it means that we recognise in the object, not the
          particular thing, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page271">[pg
          271]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg271"></a>
          but an Idea; and this can only happen, so far as our contemplation
          of it is not subordinated to the principle of sufficient reason,
          does not follow the relation of the object to anything outside it
          (which is always ultimately connected with relations to our own
          will), but rests in the object itself. For the Idea and the pure
          subject of knowledge always appear at once in consciousness as
          necessary correlatives, and on their appearance all distinction of
          time vanishes, for they are both entirely foreign to the principle
          of sufficient reason in all its forms, and lie outside the
          relations which are imposed by it; they may be compared to the
          rainbow and the sun, which have no part in the constant movement
          and succession of the falling drops. Therefore, if, for example, I
          contemplate a tree æsthetically, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          with artistic eyes, and thus recognise, not it, but its Idea, it
          becomes at once of no consequence whether it is this tree or its
          predecessor which flourished a thousand years ago, and whether the
          observer is this individual or any other that lived anywhere and at
          any time; the particular thing and the knowing individual are
          abolished with the principle of sufficient reason, and there
          remains nothing but the Idea and the pure subject of knowing, which
          together constitute the adequate objectivity of will at this grade.
          And the Idea dispenses not only with time, but also with space, for
          the Idea proper is not this special form which appears before me
          but its expression, its pure significance, its inner being, which
          discloses itself to me and appeals to me, and which may be quite
          the same though the spatial relations of its form be very
          different.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Since, on the
          one hand, every given thing may be observed in a. purely objective
          manner and apart from all relations; and since, on the other hand,
          the will manifests itself in everything at some grade of its
          objectivity, so that everything is the expression of an Idea; it
          follows that everything is also <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">beautiful</span></em>. That even the most
          insignificant things admit of pure objective and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page272">[pg 272]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg272"></a> will-less contemplation, and thus prove
          that they are beautiful, is shown by what was said above in this
          reference about the Dutch pictures of still-life (<a class="tei tei-ref pginternal" href="#Section_38">§ 38</a>). But one thing is more
          beautiful than another, because it makes this pure objective
          contemplation easier, it lends itself to it, and, so to speak, even
          compels it, and then we call it very beautiful. This is the case
          sometimes because, as an individual thing, it expresses in its
          purity the Idea of its species by the very distinct, clearly
          defined, and significant relation of its parts, and also fully
          reveals that Idea through the completeness of all the possible
          expressions of its species united in it, so that it makes the
          transition from the individual thing to the Idea, and therefore
          also the condition of pure contemplation, very easy for the
          beholder. Sometimes this possession of special beauty in an object
          lies in the fact that the Idea itself which appeals to us in it is
          a high grade of the objectivity of will, and therefore very
          significant and expressive. Therefore it is that man is more
          beautiful than all other objects, and the revelation of his nature
          is the highest aim of art. Human form and expression are the most
          important objects of plastic art, and human action the most
          important object of poetry. Yet each thing has its own peculiar
          beauty, not only every organism which expresses itself in the unity
          of an individual being, but also everything unorganised and
          formless, and even every manufactured article. For all these reveal
          the Ideas through which the will objectifies itself at its lowest
          grades, they give, as it were, the deepest resounding bass-notes of
          nature. Gravity, rigidity, fluidity, light, and so forth, are the
          Ideas which express themselves in rocks, in buildings, in waters.
          Landscape-gardening or architecture can do no more than assist them
          to unfold their qualities distinctly, fully, and variously; they
          can only give them the opportunity of expressing themselves purely,
          so that they lend themselves to æsthetic contemplation and make it
          easier. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page273">[pg
          273]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg273"></a>
          Inferior buildings or ill-favoured localities, on the contrary,
          which nature has neglected or art has spoiled, perform this task in
          a very slight degree or not at all; yet even from them these
          universal, fundamental Ideas of nature cannot altogether disappear.
          To the careful observer they present themselves here also, and even
          bad buildings and the like are capable of being æsthetically
          considered; the Ideas of the most universal properties of their
          materials are still recognisable in them, only the artificial form
          which has been given them does not assist but hinders æsthetic
          contemplation. Manufactured articles also serve to express Ideas,
          only it is not the Idea of the manufactured article which speaks in
          them, but the Idea of the material to which this artificial form
          has been given. This may be very conveniently expressed in two
          words, in the language of the schoolmen, thus,—the manufactured
          article expresses the Idea of its <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">forma substantialis</span></span>, but not
          that of its <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">forma
          accidentalis</span></span>; the latter leads to no Idea, but only
          to a human conception of which it is the result. It is needless to
          say that by manufactured article no work of plastic art is meant.
          The schoolmen understand, in fact, by <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">forma substantialis</span></span> that which I
          call the grade of the objectification of will in a thing. We shall
          return immediately, when we treat of architecture, to the Idea of
          the material. Our view, then, cannot be reconciled with that of
          Plato if he is of opinion that a table or a chair express the Idea
          of a table or a chair (De Rep., x., pp. 284, 285, et Parmen., p.
          79, ed. Bip.), but we say that they express the Ideas which are
          already expressed in their mere material as such. According to
          Aristotle (Metap. xi., chap. 3), however, Plato himself only

          ὁποσα φυσει (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Plato dixit, quod ideæ eorum
          sunt, quæ natura sunt</span></span>), and in chap. 5 he says that,
          according to the Platonists, there are no Ideas of house and ring.
          In any case, Plato's earliest disciples, as Alcinous informs us
          (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Introductio</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page274">[pg 274]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg274"></a><span style="font-style: italic">in Platonicam
          Philosophiam</span></span>, chap. 9), denied that there were any
          ideas of manufactured articles. He says: Ὁριζονται δε την ιδεαν,
          παραδειγμα των κατα φυσιν αιωνιον. Ουτε γαρ τοις πλειστοις των απο
          Πλατωνος αρεσκει, των τεχνικων ειναι ιδεας, οἱον ασπιδος η λυρας,
          ουτε μην των παρα φυσιν, οἱον πυρετου και χολερας, ουτε των κατα

          οἱον ρυπου και καρφους, ουτε των προς τι, οἱον μειζονος και
          ὑπερεχοντος; ειναι γαρ τας ιδεας νοησεις θεου αιωνιους τε και
          αυτοτελεις (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Definiunt autem</span></span>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">ideam</span></span> <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">exemplar æternum eorum, quæ secundum naturam
          existunt. Nam plurimis ex iis, qui Platonem secuti sunt, minime
          placuit, arte factorum ideas esse, ut clypei atque lyræ; neque
          rursus eorum, quæ prætor naturam, ut febris et choleræ, neque
          particularium, ceu Socratis et Platonis; neque etiam rerum vilium,
          veluti sordium et festucæ; neque relationum, ut majoris et
          excedentis: esse namque ideas intellectiones dei æternas, ac
          seipsis perfectas</span></span>). We may take this opportunity of
          mentioning another point in which our doctrine of Ideas differs
          very much from that of Plato. He teaches (De Rep., x., p. 288) that
          the object which art tries to express, the ideal of painting and
          poetry, is not the Idea but the particular thing. Our whole
          exposition hitherto has maintained exactly the opposite, and
          Plato's opinion is the less likely to lead us astray, inasmuch as
          it is the source of one of the greatest and best known errors of
          this great man, his depreciation and rejection of art, and
          especially poetry; he directly connects his false judgment in
          reference to this with the passage quoted.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 42. I return
          to the exposition of the æsthetic impression. The knowledge of the
          beautiful always supposes at once and inseparably the pure knowing
          subject and the known Idea as object. Yet the source of æsthetic
          satisfaction will sometimes lie more in the comprehension of the
          known Idea, sometimes more in the blessedness and spiritual peace
          of the pure knowing subject <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page275">[pg 275]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg275"></a> freed from all willing, and therefore from
          all individuality, and the pain that proceeds from it. And, indeed,
          this predominance of one or the other constituent part of æsthetic
          feeling will depend upon whether the intuitively grasped Idea is a
          higher or a lower grade of the objectivity of will. Thus in
          æsthetic contemplation (in the real, or through the medium of art)
          of the beauty of nature in the inorganic and vegetable worlds, or
          in works of architecture, the pleasure of pure will-less knowing
          will predominate, because the Ideas which are here apprehended are
          only low grades of the objectivity of will, and are therefore not
          manifestations of deep significance and rich content. On the other
          hand, if animals and man are the objects of æsthetic contemplation
          or representation, the pleasure will consist rather in the
          comprehension of these Ideas, which are the most distinct
          revelation of will; for they exhibit the greatest multiplicity of
          forms, the greatest richness and deep significance of phenomena,
          and reveal to us most completely the nature of will, whether in its
          violence, its terribleness, its satisfaction or its aberration (the
          latter in tragic situations), or finally in its change and
          self-surrender, which is the peculiar theme of christian painting;
          as the Idea of the will enlightened by full knowledge is the object
          of historical painting in general, and of the drama. We shall now
          go through the fine arts one by one, and this will give
          completeness and distinctness to the theory of the beautiful which
          we have advanced.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 43. Matter as
          such cannot be the expression of an Idea. For, as we found in the
          first book, it is throughout nothing but causality: its being
          consists in its casual action. But causality is a form of the
          principle of sufficient reason; knowledge of the Idea, on the other
          hand, absolutely excludes the content of that principle. We also
          found, in the second book, that matter is the common substratum of
          all particular phenomena of the Ideas, and consequently is the
          connecting link between <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page276">[pg
          276]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg276"></a>
          the Idea and the phenomenon, or the particular thing. Accordingly
          for both of these reasons it is impossible that matter can for
          itself express any Idea. This is confirmed <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          posteriori</span></span> by the fact that it is impossible to have
          a perceptible idea of matter as such, but only an abstract
          conception; in the former, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, in perceptible ideas are
          exhibited only the forms and qualities of which matter is the
          supporter, and in all of which Ideas reveal themselves. This
          corresponds also with the fact, that causality (the whole essence
          of matter) cannot for itself be presented perceptibly, but is
          merely a definite casual connection. On the other hand, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">every
          phenomenon</span></em> of an Idea, because as such it has entered
          the form of the principle of sufficient reason, or the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium individuationis</span></span>, must
          exhibit itself in matter, as one of its qualities. So far then
          matter is, as we have said, the connecting link between the Idea
          and the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium
          individuationis</span></span>, which is the form of knowledge of
          the individual, or the principle of sufficient reason. Plato is
          therefore perfectly right in his enumeration, for after the Idea
          and the phenomenon, which include all other things in the world, he
          gives matter only, as a third thing which is different from both
          (Timaus, p. 345). The individual, as a phenomenon of the Idea, is
          always matter. Every quality of matter is also the phenomenon of an
          Idea, and as such it may always be an object of æsthetic
          contemplation, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the Idea expressed in it
          may always be recognised. This holds good of even the most
          universal qualities of matter, without which it never appears, and
          which are the weakest objectivity of will. Such are gravity,
          cohesion, rigidity, fluidity, sensitiveness to light, and so
          forth.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If now we
          consider <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">architecture</span></em> simply as a fine art
          and apart from its application to useful ends, in which it serves
          the will and not pure knowledge, and therefore ceases to be art in
          our sense; we can assign to it no other aim than that of bringing
          to greater distinctness <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page277">[pg
          277]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg277"></a>
          some of those ideas, which are the lowest grades of the objectivity
          of will; such as gravity, cohesion, rigidity, hardness, those
          universal qualities of stone, those first, simplest, most
          inarticulate manifestations of will; the bass notes of nature; and
          after these light, which in many respects is their opposite. Even
          at these low grades of the objectivity of will we see its nature
          revealing itself in discord; for properly speaking the conflict
          between gravity and rigidity is the sole æsthetic material of
          architecture; its problem is to make this conflict appear with
          perfect distinctness in a multitude of different ways. It solves it
          by depriving these indestructible forces of the shortest way to
          their satisfaction, and conducting them to it by a circuitous
          route, so that the conflict is lengthened and the inexhaustible
          efforts of both forces become visible in many different ways. The
          whole mass of the building, if left to its original tendency, would
          exhibit a mere heap or clump, bound as closely as possible to the
          earth, to which gravity, the form in which the will appears here,
          continually presses, while rigidity, also objectivity of will,
          resists. But this very tendency, this effort, is hindered by
          architecture from obtaining direct satisfaction, and only allowed
          to reach it indirectly and by roundabout ways. The roof, for
          example, can only press the earth through columns, the arch must
          support itself, and can only satisfy its tendency towards the earth
          through the medium of the pillars, and so forth. But just by these
          enforced digressions, just by these restrictions, the forces which
          reside in the crude mass of stone unfold themselves in the most
          distinct and multifarious ways; and the purely æsthetic aim of
          architecture can go no further than this. Therefore the beauty, at
          any rate, of a building lies in the obvious adaptation of every
          part, not to the outward arbitrary end of man (so far the work
          belongs to practical architecture), but directly to the stability
          of the whole, to which the position, dimensions, and form of every
          part must have so <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page278">[pg
          278]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg278"></a>
          necessary a relation that, where it is possible, if any one part
          were taken away, the whole would fall to pieces. For just because
          each part bears just as much as it conveniently can, and each is
          supported just where it requires to be and just to the necessary
          extent, this opposition unfolds itself, this conflict between
          rigidity and gravity, which constitutes the life, the manifestation
          of will, in the stone, becomes completely visible, and these lowest
          grades of the objectivity of will reveal themselves distinctly. In
          the same way the form of each part must not be determined
          arbitrarily, but by its end, and its relation to the whole. The
          column is the simplest form of support, determined simply by its
          end: the twisted column is tasteless; the four-cornered pillar is
          in fact not so simple as the round column, though it happens that
          it is easier to make it. The forms also of frieze, rafter, roof,
          and dome are entirely determined by their immediate end, and
          explain themselves from it. The decoration of capitals, &amp;c.,
          belongs to sculpture, not to architecture, which admits it merely
          as extraneous ornament, and could dispense with it. According to
          what has been said, it is absolutely necessary, in order to
          understand the æsthetic satisfaction afforded by a work of
          architecture, to have immediate knowledge through perception of its
          matter as regards its weight, rigidity, and cohesion, and our
          pleasure in such a work would suddenly be very much diminished by
          the discovery that the material used was pumice-stone; for then it
          would appear to us as a kind of sham building. We would be affected
          in almost the same way if we were told that it was made of wood,
          when we had supposed it to be of stone, just because this alters
          and destroys the relation between rigidity and gravity, and
          consequently the significance and necessity of all the parts, for
          these natural forces reveal themselves in a far weaker degree in a
          wooden building. Therefore no real work of architecture as a fine
          art can be made of wood, although it assumes all forms so easily;
          this can only be <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page279">[pg
          279]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg279"></a>
          explained by our theory. If we were distinctly told that a
          building, the sight of which gave us pleasure, was made of
          different kinds of material of very unequal weight and consistency,
          but not distinguishable to the eye, the whole building would become
          as utterly incapable of affording us pleasure as a poem in an
          unknown language. All this proves that architecture does not affect
          us mathematically, but also dynamically, and that what speaks to us
          through it, is not mere form and symmetry, but rather those
          fundamental forces of nature, those first Ideas, those lowest
          grades of the objectivity of will. The regularity of the building
          and its parts is partly produced by the direct adaptation of each
          member to the stability of the whole, partly it serves to
          facilitate the survey and comprehension of the whole, and finally,
          regular figures to some extent enhance the beauty because they
          reveal the constitution of space as such. But all this is of
          subordinate value and necessity, and by no means the chief concern;
          indeed, symmetry is not invariably demanded, as ruins are still
          beautiful.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Works of
          architecture have further quite a special relation to light; they
          gain a double beauty in the full sunshine, with the blue sky as a
          background, and again they have quite a different effect by
          moonlight. Therefore, when a beautiful work of architecture is to
          be erected, special attention is always paid to the effects of the
          light and to the climate. The reason of all this is, indeed,
          principally that all the parts and their relations are only made
          clearly visible by a bright, strong light; but besides this I am of
          opinion that it is the function of architecture to reveal the
          nature of light just as it reveals that of things so opposite to it
          as gravity and rigidity. For the light is intercepted, confined,
          and reflected by the great opaque, sharply outlined, and variously
          formed masses of stone, and thus it unfolds its nature and
          qualities in the purest and clearest way, to the great pleasure of
          the beholders, for light is the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page280">[pg 280]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg280"></a> most joy-giving of things, as the condition
          and the objective correlative of the most perfect kind of knowledge
          of perception.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now, because the
          Ideas which architecture brings to clear perception, are the lowest
          grades of the objectivity of will, and consequently their objective
          significance, which architecture reveals to us, is comparatively
          small; the æsthetic pleasure of looking at a beautiful building in
          a good light will lie, not so much in the comprehension of the
          Idea, as in the subjective correlative which accompanies this
          comprehension; it will consist pre-eminently in the fact that the
          beholder, set free from the kind of knowledge that belongs to the
          individual, and which serves the will and follows the principle of
          sufficient reason, is raised to that of the pure subject of knowing
          free from will. It will consist then principally in pure
          contemplation itself, free from all the suffering of will and of
          individuality. In this respect the opposite of architecture, and
          the other extreme of the series of the fine arts, is the drama,
          which brings to knowledge the most significant Ideas. Therefore in
          the æsthetic pleasure afforded by the drama the objective side is
          throughout predominant.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Architecture has
          this distinction from plastic art and poetry: it does not give us a
          copy but the thing itself. It does not repeat, as they do, the
          known Idea, so that the artist lends his eyes to the beholder, but
          in it the artist merely presents the object to the beholder, and
          facilitates for him the comprehension of the Idea by bringing the
          actual, individual object to a distinct and complete expression of
          its nature.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Unlike the works
          of the other arts, those of architecture are very seldom executed
          for purely æsthetic ends. These are generally subordinated to other
          useful ends which are foreign to art itself. Thus the great merit
          of the architect consists in achieving and attaining the pure
          æsthetic ends, in spite of their subordination to other
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page281">[pg 281]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg281"></a> ends which are
          foreign to them. This he does by cleverly adapting them in a
          variety of ways to the arbitrary ends in view, and by rightly
          judging which form of æsthetical architectonic beauty is compatible
          and may be associated with a temple, which with a palace, which
          with a prison, and so forth. The more a harsh climate increases
          these demands of necessity and utility, determines them definitely,
          and prescribes them more inevitably, the less free play has beauty
          in architecture. In the mild climate of India, Egypt, Greece, and
          Rome, where the demands of necessity were fewer and less definite,
          architecture could follow its æsthetic ends with the greatest
          freedom. But under a northern sky this was sorely hindered. Here,
          when caissons, pointed roofs and towers were what was demanded,
          architecture could only unfold its own beauty within very narrow
          limits, and therefore it was obliged to make amends by resorting
          all the more to the borrowed ornaments of sculpture, as is seen in
          Gothic architecture.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We thus see that
          architecture is greatly restricted by the demands of necessity and
          utility; but on the other hand it has in them a very powerful
          support, for, on account of the magnitude and costliness of its
          works, and the narrow sphere of its æsthetic effect, it could not
          continue to exist merely as a fine art, if it had not also, as a
          useful and necessary profession, a firm and honourable place among
          the occupations of men. It is the want of this that prevents
          another art from taking its place beside architecture as a sister
          art, although in an æsthetical point of view it is quite properly
          to be classed along with it as its counterpart; I mean artistic
          arrangements of water. For what architecture accomplishes for the
          Idea of gravity when it appears in connection with that of
          rigidity, hydraulics accomplishes for the same Idea, when it is
          connected with fluidity, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, formlessness, the greatest
          mobility and transparency. Leaping waterfalls foaming and tumbling
          over rocks, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page282">[pg
          282]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg282"></a>
          cataracts dispersed into floating spray, springs gushing up as high
          columns of water, and clear reflecting lakes, reveal the Ideas of
          fluid and heavy matter, in precisely the same way as the works of
          architecture unfold the Ideas of rigid matter. Artistic hydraulics,
          however, obtains no support from practical hydraulics, for, as a
          rule, their ends cannot be combined; yet, in exceptional cases,
          this happens; for example, in the Cascata di Trevi at Rome.<a href="#note_52" id="noteref_52" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">52</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 44. What the
          two arts we have spoken of accomplish for these lowest grades of
          the objectivity of will, is performed for the higher grades of
          vegetable nature by artistic horticulture. The landscape beauty of
          a scene consists, for the most part, in the multiplicity of natural
          objects which are present in it, and then in the fact that they are
          clearly separated, appear distinctly, and yet exhibit a fitting
          connection and alternation. These two conditions are assisted and
          promoted by landscape-gardening, but it has by no means such a
          mastery over its material as architecture, and therefore its effect
          is limited. The beauty with which it is concerned belongs almost
          exclusively to nature; it has done little for it; and, on the other
          hand, it can do little against unfavourable nature, and when nature
          works, not for it, but against it, its achievements are small.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The vegetable
          world offers itself everywhere for æsthetic enjoyment without the
          medium of art; but so far as it is an object of art, it belongs
          principally to landscape-painting; to the province of which all the
          rest of unconscious nature also belongs. In paintings of still
          life, and of mere architecture, ruins, interiors of churches,
          &amp;c., the subjective side of æsthetic pleasure is predominant,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, our satisfaction does not
          lie principally in the direct comprehension of the represented
          Ideas, but rather in the subjective correlative of this
          comprehension, pure, will-less knowing. For, because the painter
          lets us see these <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page283">[pg
          283]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg283"></a>
          things through his eyes, we at once receive a sympathetic and
          reflected sense of the deep spiritual peace and absolute silence of
          the will, which were necessary in order to enter with knowledge so
          entirely into these lifeless objects, and comprehend them with such
          love, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, in this case with such a
          degree of objectivity. The effect of landscape-painting proper is
          indeed, as a whole, of this kind; but because the Ideas expressed
          are more distinct and significant, as higher grades of the
          objectivity of will, the objective side of æsthetic pleasure
          already comes more to the front and assumes as much importance as
          the subjective side. Pure knowing as such is no longer the
          paramount consideration, for we are equally affected by the known
          Platonic Idea, the world as idea at an important grade of the
          objectification of will.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But a far higher
          grade is revealed by animal painting and sculpture. Of the latter
          we have some important antique remains; for example, horses at
          Venice, on Monte Cavallo, and on the Elgin Marbles, also at
          Florence in bronze and marble; the ancient boar, howling wolves,
          the lions in the arsenal at Venice, also in the Vatican a whole
          room almost filled with ancient animals, &amp;c. In these
          representations the objective side of æsthetic pleasure obtains a
          marked predominance over the subjective. The peace of the subject
          which knows these Ideas, which has silenced its own will, is indeed
          present, as it is in all æsthetic contemplation; but its effect is
          not felt, for we are occupied with the restlessness and impetuosity
          of the will represented. It is that very will, which constitutes
          our own nature, that here appears to us in forms, in which its
          manifestation is not, as in us, controlled and tempered by
          intellect, but exhibits itself in stronger traits, and with a
          distinctness that borders on the grotesque and monstrous. For this
          very reason there is no concealment; it is free, naïve, open as the
          day, and this is the cause of our interest in animals. The
          characteristics of species appeared already in the representation
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page284">[pg 284]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg284"></a> of plants, but
          showed itself only in the forms; here it becomes much more
          distinct, and expresses itself not only in the form, but in the
          action, position, and mien, yet always merely as the character of
          the species, not of the individual. This knowledge of the Ideas of
          higher grades, which in painting we receive through extraneous
          means, we may gain directly by the pure contemplative perception of
          plants, and observation of beasts, and indeed of the latter in
          their free, natural, and unrestrained state. The objective
          contemplation of their manifold and marvellous forms, and of their
          actions and behaviour, is an instructive lesson from the great book
          of nature, it is a deciphering of the true <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">signatura rerum</span></span>.<a href="#note_53" id="noteref_53" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">53</span></span></a> We see
          in them the manifold grades and modes of the manifestation of will,
          which in all beings of one and the same grade, wills always in the
          same way, which objectifies itself as life, as existence in such
          endless variety, and such different forms, which are all
          adaptations to the different external circumstances, and may be
          compared to many variations on the same theme. But if we had to
          communicate to the observer, for reflection, and in a word, the
          explanation of their inner nature, it would be best to make use of
          that Sanscrit formula which occurs so often in the sacred books of
          the Hindoos, and is called Mahavakya, i.e., the great word:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">Tat twam
          asi</span></span>,”</span> which means, <span class="tei tei-q">“this living thing art thou.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 45. The great
          problem of historical painting and sculpture is to express directly
          and for perception the Idea in which the will reaches the highest
          grade of its objectification. The objective side of the pleasure
          afforded by the beautiful is here always predominant, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page285">[pg 285]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg285"></a> and the subjective side has retired
          into the background. It is further to be observed that at the next
          grade below this, animal painting, the characteristic is entirely
          one with the beautiful; the most characteristic lion, wolf, horse,
          sheep, or ox, was always the most beautiful also. The reason of
          this is that animals have only the character of their species, no
          individual character. In the representation of men the character of
          the species is separated from that of the individual; the former is
          now called beauty (entirely in the objective sense), but the latter
          retains the name, character, or expression, and the new difficulty
          arises of representing both, at once and completely, in the same
          individual.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Human
          beauty</span></em> is an objective expression, which means the
          fullest objectification of will at the highest grade at which it is
          knowable, the Idea of man in general, completely expressed in the
          sensible form. But however much the objective side of the beautiful
          appears here, the subjective side still always accompanies it. And
          just because no object transports us so quickly into pure æsthetic
          contemplation, as the most beautiful human countenance and form, at
          the sight of which we are instantly filled with unspeakable
          satisfaction, and raised above ourselves and all that troubles us;
          this is only possible because this most distinct and purest
          knowledge of will raises us most easily and quickly to the state of
          pure knowing, in which our personality, our will with its constant
          pain, disappears, so long as the pure æsthetic pleasure lasts.
          Therefore it is that Goethe says: <span class="tei tei-q">“No evil
          can touch him who looks on human beauty; he feels himself at one
          with himself and with the world.”</span> That a beautiful human
          form is produced by nature must be explained in this way. At this
          its highest grade the will objectifies itself in an individual; and
          therefore through circumstances and its own power it completely
          overcomes all the hindrances and opposition which the phenomena of
          the lower grades present to it. Such are the forces <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page286">[pg 286]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg286"></a> of nature, from which the will must
          always first extort and win back the matter that belongs to all its
          manifestations. Further, the phenomenon of will at its higher
          grades always has multiplicity in its form. Even the tree is only a
          systematic aggregate of innumerably repeated sprouting fibres. This
          combination assumes greater complexity in higher forms, and the
          human body is an exceedingly complex system of different parts,
          each of which has a peculiar life of its own, <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">vita propria</span></span>, subordinate to the
          whole. Now that all these parts are in the proper fashion
          subordinate to the whole, and co-ordinate to each other, that they
          all work together harmoniously for the expression of the whole,
          nothing superfluous, nothing restricted; all these are the rare
          conditions, whose result is beauty, the completely expressed
          character of the species. So is it in nature. But how in art? One
          would suppose that art achieved the beautiful by imitating nature.
          But how is the artist to recognise the perfect work which is to be
          imitated, and distinguish it from the failures, if he does not
          anticipate the beautiful <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">before experience</span></em>? And besides
          this, has nature ever produced a human being perfectly beautiful in
          all his parts? It has accordingly been thought that the artist must
          seek out the beautiful parts, distributed among a number of
          different human beings, and out of them construct a beautiful
          whole; a perverse and foolish opinion. For it will be asked, how is
          he to know that just these forms and not others are beautiful? We
          also see what kind of success attended the efforts of the old
          German painters to achieve the beautiful by imitating nature.
          Observe their naked figures. No knowledge of the beautiful is
          possible purely <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a posteriori</span></span>,
          and from mere experience; it is always, at least in part,
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span>, although quite
          different in kind, from the forms of the principle of sufficient
          reason, of which we are conscious <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          priori</span></span>. These concern the universal form of phenomena
          as such, as it constitutes the possibility <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page287">[pg 287]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg287"></a> of knowledge in general, the universal
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">how</span></em> of all phenomena, and from
          this knowledge proceed mathematics and pure natural science. But
          this other kind of knowledge <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          priori</span></span>, which makes it possible to express the
          beautiful, concerns, not the form but the content of phenomena, not
          the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">how</span></em> but the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">what</span></em> of
          the phenomenon. That we all recognise human beauty when we see it,
          but that in the true artist this takes place with such clearness
          that he shows it as he has never seen it, and surpasses nature in
          his representation; this is only possible because <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">we ourselves
          are</span></em> the will whose adequate objectification at its
          highest grade is here to be judged and discovered. Thus alone have
          we in fact an anticipation of that which nature (which is just the
          will that constitutes our own being) strives to express. And in the
          true genius this anticipation is accompanied by so great a degree
          of intelligence that he recognises the Idea in the particular
          thing, and thus, as it were, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">understands the half-uttered speech of
          nature</span></em>, and articulates clearly what she only stammered
          forth. He expresses in the hard marble that beauty of form which in
          a thousand attempts she failed to produce, he presents it to
          nature, saying, as it were, to her, <span class="tei tei-q">“That
          is what you wanted to say!”</span> And whoever is able to judge
          replies, <span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, that is it.”</span> Only in
          this way was it possible for the genius of the Greeks to find the
          type of human beauty and establish it as a canon for the school of
          sculpture; and only by virtue of such an anticipation is it
          possible for all of us to recognise beauty, when it has actually
          been achieved by nature in the particular case. This anticipation
          is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ideal</span></em>. It is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Idea</span></em> so
          far as it is known <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          priori</span></span>, at least half, and it becomes practical for
          art, because it corresponds to and completes what is given
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a posteriori</span></span> through nature. The
          possibility of such an anticipation of the beautiful <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span> in the artist, and of
          its recognition <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a posteriori</span></span> by
          the critic, lies in the fact that the artist and the critic are
          themselves the <span class="tei tei-q">“in-itself”</span> of
          nature, the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page288">[pg
          288]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg288"></a>
          will which objectifies itself. For, as Empedocles said, like can
          only be known by like: only nature can understand itself: only
          nature can fathom itself: but only spirit also can understand
          spirit.<a href="#note_54" id="noteref_54" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">54</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The opinion,
          which is absurd, although expressed by the Socrates of Xenophon
          (Stobæi Floril, vol. ii. p. 384) that the Greeks discovered the
          established ideal of human beauty empirically, by collecting
          particular beautiful parts, uncovering and noting here a knee,
          there an arm, has an exact parallel in the art of poetry. The view
          is entertained, that Shakespeare, for example, observed, and then
          gave forth from his own experience of life, the innumerable variety
          of the characters in his dramas, so true, so sustained, so
          profoundly worked out. The impossibility and absurdity of such an
          assumption need not be dwelt upon. It is obvious that the man of
          genius produces the works of poetic art by means of an anticipation
          of what is characteristic, just as he produces the works of plastic
          and pictorial art by means of a prophetic anticipation of the
          beautiful; yet both require experience as a pattern or model, for
          thus alone can that which is dimly known <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          priori</span></span> be called into clear consciousness, and an
          intelligent representation of it becomes possible.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Human beauty was
          explained above as the fullest objectification of will at the
          highest grade at which it is knowable. It expresses itself through
          the form; and this lies in space alone, and has no necessary
          connection with time, as, for example, motion has. Thus far then we
          may say: the adequate objectification of will through a merely
          spatial phenomenon is beauty, in the objective sense. A plant is
          nothing but such a merely spatial <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page289">[pg 289]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg289"></a> phenomenon of will; for no motion, and
          consequently no relation to time (regarded apart from its
          development), belongs to the expression of its nature; its mere
          form expresses its whole being and displays it openly. But brutes
          and men require, further, for the full revelation of the will which
          is manifested in them, a series of actions, and thus the
          manifestation in them takes on a direct relation to time. All this
          has already been explained in the preceding book; it is related to
          what we are considering at present in the following way. As the
          merely spatial manifestation of will can objectify it fully or
          defectively at each definite grade,—and it is this which
          constitutes beauty or ugliness,—so the temporal objectification of
          will, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the action, and indeed the
          direct action, the movement, may correspond to the will, which
          objectifies itself in it, purely and fully without foreign
          admixture, without superfluity, without defect, only expressing
          exactly the act of will determined in each case;—or the converse of
          all this may occur. In the first case the movement is made with
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">grace</span></em>, in the second case without
          it. Thus as beauty is the adequate representation of will
          generally, through its merely spatial manifestation; <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">grace</span></em>
          is the adequate representation of will through its temporal
          manifestation, that is to say, the perfectly accurate and fitting
          expression of each act of will, through the movement and position
          which objectify it. Since movement and position presuppose the
          body, Winckelmann's expression is very true and suitable, when he
          says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Grace is the proper relation of the
          acting person to the action”</span> (Works, vol. i. p. 258). It is
          thus evident that beauty may be attributed to a plant, but no
          grace, unless in a figurative sense; but to brutes and men, both
          beauty and grace. Grace consists, according to what has been said,
          in every movement being performed, and every position assumed, in
          the easiest, most appropriate and convenient way, and therefore
          being the pure, adequate expression of its intention, or of
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page290">[pg 290]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg290"></a> the act of will,
          without any superfluity, which exhibits itself as aimless,
          meaningless bustle, or as wooden stiffness. Grace presupposes as
          its condition a true proportion of all the limbs, and a
          symmetrical, harmonious figure; for complete ease and evident
          appropriateness of all positions and movements are only possible by
          means of these. Grace is therefore never without a certain degree
          of beauty of person. The two, complete and united, are the most
          distinct manifestation of will at the highest grade of its
          objectification.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was mentioned
          above that in order rightly to portray man, it is necessary to
          separate the character of the species from that of the individual,
          so that to a certain extent every man expresses an Idea peculiar to
          himself, as was said in the last book. Therefore the arts whose aim
          is the representation of the Idea of man, have as their problem,
          not only beauty, the character of the species, but also the
          character of the individual, which is called, <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">par excellence</span></span>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">character</span></em>. But this is only the
          case in so far as this character is to be regarded, not as
          something accidental and quite peculiar to the man as a single
          individual, but as a side of the Idea of humanity which is
          specially apparent in this individual, and the representation of
          which is therefore of assistance in revealing this Idea. Thus the
          character, although as such it is individual, must yet be Ideal,
          that is, its significance in relation to the Idea of humanity
          generally (the objectifying of which it assists in its own way)
          must be comprehended and expressed with special prominence. Apart
          from this the representation is a portrait, a copy of the
          individual as such, with all his accidental qualities. And even the
          portrait ought to be, as Winckelmann says, the ideal of the
          individual.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">character</span></em> which is to be ideally
          comprehended, as the prominence of a special side of the Idea of
          humanity, expresses itself visibly, partly through permanent
          physiognomy and bodily form, partly through passing <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page291">[pg 291]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg291"></a> emotion and passion, the reciprocal
          modification of knowing and willing by each other, which is all
          exhibited in the mien and movements. Since the individual always
          belongs to humanity, and, on the other hand, humanity always
          reveals itself in the individual with what is indeed peculiar ideal
          significance, beauty must not be destroyed by character nor
          character by beauty. For if the character of the species is
          annulled by that of the individual, the result is caricature; and
          if the character of the individual is annulled by that of the
          species, the result is an absence of meaning. Therefore the
          representation which aims at beauty, as sculpture principally does,
          will yet always modify this (the character of the species), in some
          respect, by the individual character, and will always express the
          Idea of man in a definite individual manner, giving prominence to a
          special side of it. For the human individual as such has to a
          certain extent the dignity of a special Idea, and it is essential
          to the Idea of man that it should express itself in individuals of
          special significance. Therefore we find in the works of the
          ancients, that the beauty distinctly comprehended by them, is not
          expressed in one form, but in many forms of different character. It
          is always apprehended, as it were, from a different side, and
          expressed in one way in Apollo, in another way in Bacchus, in
          another in Hercules, in another in Antinous; indeed the
          characteristic may limit the beautiful, and finally extend even to
          hideousness, in the drunken Silenus, in the Faun, &amp;c. If the
          characteristic goes so far as actually to annul the character of
          the species, if it extends to the unnatural, it becomes caricature.
          But we can far less afford to allow grace to be interfered with by
          what is characteristic than even beauty, for graceful position and
          movement are demanded for the expression of the character also; but
          yet it must be achieved in the way which is most fitting,
          appropriate, and easy for the person. This will be observed, not
          only by the sculptor and the painter, but <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page292">[pg 292]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg292"></a> also by every good actor; otherwise
          caricature will appear here also as grimace or distortion.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In sculpture,
          beauty and grace are the principal concern. The special character
          of the mind, appearing in emotion, passion, alternations of knowing
          and willing, which can only be represented by the expression of the
          countenance and the gestures, is the peculiar sphere of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">painting</span></em>. For although eyes and
          colour, which lie outside the province of sculpture, contribute
          much to beauty, they are yet far more essential to character.
          Further, beauty unfolds itself more completely when it is
          contemplated from various points of view; but the expression, the
          character, can only be completely comprehended from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em>
          point of view.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Because beauty
          is obviously the chief aim of sculpture, Lessing tried to explain
          the fact that the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Laocoon does not cry out</span></em>, by
          saying that crying out is incompatible with beauty. The Laocoon
          formed for Lessing the theme, or at least the text of a work of his
          own, and both before and after him a great deal has been written on
          the subject. I may therefore be allowed to express my views about
          it in passing, although so special a discussion does not properly
          belong to the scheme of this work, which is throughout concerned
          with what is general.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 46. That
          Laocoon, in the celebrated group, does not cry out is obvious, and
          the universal and ever-renewed surprise at this must be occasioned
          by the fact that any of us would cry out if we were in his place.
          And nature demands that it should be so; for in the case of the
          acutest physical pain, and the sudden seizure by the greatest
          bodily fear, all reflection, that might have inculcated silent
          endurance, is entirely expelled from consciousness, and nature
          relieves itself by crying out, thus expressing both the pain and
          the fear, summoning the deliverer and terrifying the assailer. Thus
          Winckelmann missed the expression of crying out; but as he wished
          to justify the artist he turned Laocoon into a Stoic, who
          considered it beneath his dignity to cry out <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page293">[pg 293]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg293"></a> <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">secundum
          naturam</span></span>, but added to his pain the useless constraint
          of suppressing all utterance of it. Winckelmann therefore sees in
          him <span class="tei tei-q">“the tried spirit of a great man, who
          writhes in agony, and yet seeks to suppress the utterance of his
          feeling, and to lock it up in himself. He does not break forth into
          loud cries, as in Virgil, but only anxious sighs escape
          him,”</span> &amp;c. (Works, vol. vii. p. 98, and at greater length
          in vol. vi. p. 104). Now Lessing criticised this opinion of
          Winckelmann's in his Laocoon, and improved it in the way mentioned
          above. In place of the psychological he gave the purely æsthetic
          reason that beauty, the principle of ancient art, does not admit of
          the expression of crying out. Another argument which he added to
          this, that a merely passing state incapable of duration ought not
          to be represented in motionless works of art, has a hundred
          examples of most excellent figures against it, which are fixed in
          merely transitory movements, dancing, wrestling, catching, &amp;c.
          Indeed Goethe, in the essay on the Laocoon, which opens the
          Propylaen (p. 8), holds that the choice of such a merely fleeting
          movement is absolutely necessary. In our own day Hirt (Horen, 1797,
          tenth St.) finally decided the point, deducing everything from the
          highest truth of expression, that Laocoon does not cry out, because
          he can no longer do so, as he is at the point of death from
          choking. Lastly, Fernow (<span class="tei tei-q">“Römische
          Studien,”</span> vol. i. p. 246) expounded and weighed all these
          opinions; he added, however, no new one of his own, but combined
          these three eclectically.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I cannot but
          wonder that such thoughtful and acute men should laboriously bring
          far-fetched and insufficient reasons, should resort to
          psychological and physiological arguments, to explain a matter the
          reason of which lies so near at hand, and is obvious at once to the
          unprejudiced; and especially I wonder that Lessing, who came so
          near the true explanation, should yet have entirely missed the real
          point.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page294">[pg
          294]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg294"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before all
          psychological and physiological inquiries as to whether Laocoon
          would cry out in his position or not (and I certainly affirm that
          he would), it must be decided as regards the group in question,
          that crying out ought not to be expressed in it, for the simple
          reason that its expression lies quite outside the province of
          sculpture. A shrieking Laocoon could not be produced in marble, but
          only a figure with the mouth open vainly endeavouring to shriek; a
          Laocoon whose voice has stuck in his throat, <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">vox faucibus haesit</span></span>. The essence
          of shrieking, and consequently its effect upon the onlooker, lies
          entirely in sound; not in the distortion of the mouth. This
          phenomenon, which necessarily accompanies shrieking, derives motive
          and justification only from the sound produced by means of it; then
          it is permissible and indeed necessary, as characteristic of the
          action, even though it interferes with beauty. But in plastic art,
          to which the representation of shrieking is quite foreign and
          impossible, it would be actual folly to represent the medium of
          violent shrieking, the distorted mouth, which would disturb all the
          features and the remainder of the expression; for thus at the
          sacrifice of many other things the means would be represented,
          while its end, the shrieking itself, and its effect upon our
          feelings, would be left out. Nay more, there would be produced the
          spectacle of a continuous effort without effect, which is always
          ridiculous, and may really be compared to what happened when some
          one for a joke stopped the horn of a night watchman with wax while
          he was asleep, and then awoke him with the cry of fire, and amused
          himself by watching his vain endeavours to blow the horn. When, on
          the other hand, the expression of shrieking lies in the province of
          poetic or histrionic art, it is quite admissible, because it helps
          to express the truth, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the complete expression of
          the Idea. Thus it is with poetry, which claims the assistance of
          the imagination of the reader, in order to enable it to represent
          things perceptibly. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page295">[pg
          295]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg295"></a>
          Therefore Virgil makes Laocoon cry out like the bellowing of an ox
          that has broken loose after being struck by the axe; and Homer (Il.
          xx. 48-53) makes Mars and Minerva shriek horribly, without
          derogating from their divine dignity or beauty. The same with
          acting; Laocoon on the stage would certainly have to shriek.
          Sophocles makes Philoctetus cry out, and, on the ancient stage at
          any rate, he must actually have done so. As a case in point, I
          remember having seen in London the great actor Kemble play in a
          piece called Pizarro, translated from the German. He took the part
          of the American, a half-savage, but of very noble character. When
          he was wounded he cried out loudly and wildly, which had a great
          and admirable effect, for it was exceedingly characteristic and
          therefore assisted the truth of the representation very much. On
          the other hand, a painted or sculptured model of a man shrieking,
          would be much more absurd than the painted music which is censured
          in Goethe's Propylaen. For shrieking does far more injury to the
          expression and beauty of the whole than music, which at the most
          only occupies the hands and arms, and is to be looked upon as an
          occupation characteristic of the person; indeed thus far it may
          quite rightly be painted, as long as it demands no violent movement
          of the body, or distortion of the mouth: for example, St. Cecilia
          at the organ, Raphael's violin-player in the Sciarra Gallery at
          Rome, and others. Since then, on account of the limits of the art,
          the pain of Laocoon must not be expressed by shrieking, the artist
          was obliged to employ every other expression of pain; this he has
          done in the most perfect manner, as is ably described by
          Winckelmann (Works, vol. vi. p. 104), whose admirable account thus
          retains its full value and truth, as soon as we abstract from the
          stoical view which underlies it.<a href="#note_55" id="noteref_55" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">55</span></span></a></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page296">[pg 296]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg296"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 47. Because
          beauty accompanied with grace is the principal object of sculpture,
          it loves nakedness, and allows clothing only so far as it does not
          conceal the form. It makes use of drapery, not as a covering, but
          as a means of exhibiting the form, a method of exposition that
          gives much exercise to the understanding, for it can only arrive at
          a perception of the cause, the form of the body, through the only
          directly given effect, the drapery. Thus to a certain extent
          drapery is in sculpture what fore-shortening is in painting. Both
          are suggestions, yet not symbolical, but such that, if they are
          successful, they force the understanding directly to perceive what
          is suggested, just as if it were actually given.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I may be
          allowed, in passing, to insert here a comparison that is very
          pertinent to the arts we are discussing. It is this: as the
          beautiful bodily form is seen to the greatest advantage when
          clothed in the lightest way, or indeed without any clothing at all,
          and therefore a very handsome man, if he had also taste and the
          courage to follow it, would go about almost naked, clothed only
          after the manner of the ancients; so every one who possesses a
          beautiful and rich mind will always express himself in the most
          natural, direct, and simple way, concerned, if it be possible, to
          communicate his thoughts to others, and thus relieve the loneliness
          that he must feel in such a world as this. And conversely, poverty
          of mind, confusion, and perversity of thought, will clothe itself
          in the most far-fetched expressions and the obscurest forms of
          speech, in order to wrap up in difficult and pompous phraseology
          small, trifling, insipid, or commonplace thoughts; like a man who
          has lost the majesty of beauty, and trying to make up for the
          deficiency by means of clothing, seeks to hide the insignificance
          or ugliness of his person under barbaric finery, tinsel, feathers,
          ruffles, cuffs, and mantles. Many an author, if compelled to
          translate his pompous and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page297">[pg
          297]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg297"></a>
          obscure book into its little clear content, would be as utterly
          spoilt as this man if he had to go naked.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 48. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Historical
          painting</span></em> has for its principal object, besides beauty
          and grace, character. By character we mean generally, the
          representation of will at the highest grade of its objectification,
          when the individual, as giving prominence to a particular side of
          the Idea of humanity, has special significance, and shows this not
          merely by his form, but makes it visible in his bearing and
          occupation, by action of every kind, and the modifications of
          knowing and willing that occasion and accompany it. The Idea of man
          must be exhibited in these circumstances, and therefore the
          unfolding of its many-sidedness must be brought before our eyes by
          means of representative individuals, and these individuals can only
          be made visible in their significance through various scenes,
          events, and actions. This is the endless problem of the historical
          painter, and he solves it by placing before us scenes of life of
          every kind, of greater or less significance. No individual and no
          action can be without significance; in all and through all the Idea
          of man unfolds itself more and more. Therefore no event of human
          life is excluded from the sphere of painting. It is thus a great
          injustice to the excellent painters of the Dutch school, to prize
          merely their technical skill, and to look down upon them in other
          respects, because, for the most part, they represent objects of
          common life, whereas it is assumed that only the events of the
          history of the world, or the incidents of biblical story, have
          significance. We ought first to bethink ourselves that the inward
          significance of an action is quite different from its outward
          significance, and that these are often separated from each other.
          The outward significance is the importance of an action in relation
          to its result for and in the actual world; thus according to the
          principle of sufficient reason. The inward significance is the
          depth of the insight into the Idea of man which it reveals, in that
          it brings <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page298">[pg
          298]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg298"></a>
          to light sides of that Idea which rarely appear, by making
          individuals who assert themselves distinctly and decidedly,
          disclose their peculiar characteristics by means of appropriately
          arranged circumstances. Only the inward significance concerns art;
          the outward belongs to history. They are both completely
          independent of each other; they may appear together, but may each
          appear alone. An action which is of the highest significance for
          history may in inward significance be a very ordinary and common
          one; and conversely, a scene of ordinary daily life may be of great
          inward significance, if human individuals, and the inmost recesses
          of human action and will, appear in it in a clear and distinct
          light. Further, the outward and the inward significance of a scene
          may be equal and yet very different. Thus, for example, it is all
          the same, as far as inward significance is concerned, whether
          ministers discuss the fate of countries and nations over a map, or
          boors wrangle in a beer-house over cards and dice, just as it is
          all the same whether we play chess with golden or wooden pieces.
          But apart from this, the scenes and events that make up the life of
          so many millions of men, their actions, their sorrows, their joys,
          are on that account important enough to be the object of art, and
          by their rich variety they must afford material enough for
          unfolding the many-sided Idea of man. Indeed the very
          transitoriness of the moment which art has fixed in such a picture
          (now called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">genre</span></em>-painting) excites a slight
          and peculiar sensation; for to fix the fleeting, ever-changing
          world in the enduring picture of a single event, which yet
          represents the whole, is an achievement of the art of painting by
          which it seems to bring time itself to a standstill, for it raises
          the individual to the Idea of its species. Finally, the historical
          and outwardly significant subjects of painting have often the
          disadvantage that just what is significant in them cannot be
          presented to perception, but must be arrived at by thought. In this
          respect the nominal <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page299">[pg
          299]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg299"></a>
          significance of the picture must be distinguished from its real
          significance. The former is the outward significance, which,
          however, can only be reached as a conception; the latter is that
          side of the Idea of man which is made visible to the onlooker in
          the picture. For example, Moses found by the Egyptian princess is
          the nominal significance of a painting; it represents a moment of
          the greatest importance in history; the real significance, on the
          other hand, that which is really given to the onlooker, is a
          foundling child rescued from its floating cradle by a great lady,
          an incident which may have happened more than once. The costume
          alone can here indicate the particular historical case to the
          learned; but the costume is only of importance to the nominal
          significance, and is a matter of indifference to the real
          significance; for the latter knows only the human being as such,
          not the arbitrary forms. Subjects taken from history have no
          advantage over those which are taken from mere possibility, and
          which are therefore to be called, not individual, but merely
          general. For what is peculiarly significant in the former is not
          the individual, not the particular event as such, but the universal
          in it, the side of the Idea of humanity which expresses itself
          through it. But, on the other hand, definite historical subjects
          are not on this account to be rejected, only the really artistic
          view of such subjects, both in the painter and in the beholder, is
          never directed to the individual particulars in them, which
          properly constitute the historical, but to the universal which
          expresses itself in them, to the Idea. And only those historical
          subjects are to be chosen the chief point of which can actually be
          represented, and not merely arrived at by thought, otherwise the
          nominal significance is too remote from the real; what is merely
          thought in connection with the picture becomes of most importance,
          and interferes with what is perceived. If even on the stage it is
          not right that the chief incident of the plot should take place
          behind the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page300">[pg
          300]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg300"></a>
          scenes (as in French tragedies), it is clearly a far greater fault
          in a picture. Historical subjects are distinctly disadvantageous
          only when they confine the painter to a field which has not been
          chosen for artistic but for other reasons, and especially when this
          field is poor in picturesque and significant objects—if, for
          example, it is the history of a small, isolated, capricious,
          hierarchical (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, ruled by error), obscure
          people, like the Jews, despised by the great contemporary nations
          of the East and the West. Since the wandering of the tribes lies
          between us and all ancient nations, as the change of the bed of the
          ocean lies between the earth's surface as it is to-day and as it
          was when those organisations existed which we only know from fossil
          remains, it is to be regarded generally as a great misfortune that
          the people whose culture was to be the principal basis of our own
          were not the Indians or the Greeks, or even the Romans, but these
          very Jews. But it was especially a great misfortune for the Italian
          painters of genius in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries that,
          in the narrow sphere to which they were arbitrarily driven for the
          choice of subjects, they were obliged to have recourse to miserable
          beings of every kind. For the New Testament, as regards its
          historical part, is almost more unsuitable for painting than the
          Old, and the subsequent history of martyrs and doctors of the
          church is a very unfortunate subject. Yet of the pictures, whose
          subject is the history or mythology of Judaism and Christianity, we
          must carefully distinguish those in which the peculiar,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the ethical spirit of
          Christianity is revealed for perception, by the representation of
          men who are full of this spirit. These representations are in fact
          the highest and most admirable achievements of the art of painting;
          and only the greatest masters of this art succeeded in this,
          particularly Raphael and Correggio, and especially in their earlier
          pictures. Pictures of this kind are not properly to be classed as
          historical: for, as a rule, they represent no event, no action; but
          are merely groups of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page301">[pg
          301]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg301"></a>
          saints, with the Saviour himself, often still a child, with His
          mother, angels, &amp;c. In their countenances, and especially in
          the eyes, we see the expression, the reflection, of the completest
          knowledge, that which is not directed to particular things, but has
          fully grasped the Ideas, and thus the whole nature of the world and
          life. And this knowledge in them, reacting upon the will, does not,
          like other knowledge, convey <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">motives</span></em> to it, but on the contrary
          has become a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">quieter</span></em> of all will, from which
          proceeded the complete resignation, which is the innermost spirit
          of Christianity, as of the Indian philosophy; the surrender of all
          volition, conversion, the suppression of will, and with it of the
          whole inner being of this world, that is to say, salvation. Thus
          these masters of art, worthy of eternal praise, expressed
          perceptibly in their works the highest wisdom. And this is the
          summit of all art. It has followed the will in its adequate
          objectivity, the Ideas, through all its grades, in which it is
          affected and its nature unfolded in so many ways, first by causes,
          then by stimuli, and finally by motives. And now art ends with the
          representation of the free self-suppression of will, by means of
          the great peace which it gains from the perfect knowledge of its
          own nature.<a href="#note_56" id="noteref_56" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">56</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 49. The truth
          which lies at the foundation of all that we have hitherto said
          about art, is that the object of art, the representation of which
          is the aim of the artist, and the knowledge of which must therefore
          precede his work as its germ and source, is an Idea in Plato's
          sense, and never anything else; not the particular thing, the
          object of common apprehension, and not the concept, the object of
          rational thought and of science. Although the Idea and the concept
          have something in common, because both represent as unity a
          multiplicity of real things; yet the great difference between them
          has no doubt been made clear and evident enough by what we have
          said <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page302">[pg 302]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg302"></a> about concepts in
          the first book, and about Ideas in this book. I by no means wish to
          assert, however, that Plato really distinctly comprehended this
          difference; indeed many of his examples of Ideas, and his
          discussions of them, are applicable only to concepts. Meanwhile we
          leave this question alone and go on our own way, glad when we come
          upon traces of any great and noble mind, yet not following his
          footsteps but our own aim. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">concept</span></em>
          is abstract, discursive, undetermined within its own sphere, only
          determined by its limits, attainable and comprehensible by him who
          has only reason, communicable by words without any other
          assistance, entirely exhausted by its definition. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Idea</span></em> on
          the contrary, although defined as the adequate representative of
          the concept, is always object of perception, and although
          representing an infinite number of particular things, is yet
          thoroughly determined. It is never known by the individual as such,
          but only by him who has raised himself above all willing and all
          individuality to the pure subject of knowing. Thus it is only
          attainable by the man of genius, and by him who, for the most part
          through the assistance of the works of genius, has reached an
          exalted frame of mind, by increasing his power of pure knowing. It
          is therefore not absolutely but only conditionally communicable,
          because the Idea, comprehended and repeated in the work of art,
          appeals to every one only according to the measure of his own
          intellectual worth. So that just the most excellent works of every
          art, the noblest productions of genius, must always remain sealed
          books to the dull majority of men, inaccessible to them, separated
          from them by a wide gulf, just as the society of princes is
          inaccessible to the common people. It is true that even the dullest
          of them accept on authority recognisedly great works, lest
          otherwise they should argue their own incompetence; but they wait
          in silence, always ready to express their condemnation, as soon as
          they are allowed to hope that they may do so without being left
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page303">[pg 303]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg303"></a> to stand alone; and
          then their long-restrained hatred against all that is great and
          beautiful, and against the authors of it, gladly relieves itself;
          for such things never appealed to them, and for that very reason
          were humiliating to them. For as a rule a man must have worth in
          himself in order to recognise it and believe in it willingly and
          freely in others. On this rests the necessity of modesty in all
          merit, and the disproportionately loud praise of this virtue, which
          alone of all its sisters is always included in the eulogy of every
          one who ventures to praise any distinguished man, in order to
          appease and quiet the wrath of the unworthy. What then is modesty
          but hypocritical humility, by means of which, in a world swelling
          with base envy, a man seeks to obtain pardon for excellences and
          merits from those who have none? For whoever attributes to himself
          no merits, because he actually has none, is not modest but merely
          honest.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Idea</span></em> is
          the unity that falls into multiplicity on account of the temporal
          and spatial form of our intuitive apprehension; the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">concept</span></em>, on the contrary, is the
          unity reconstructed out of multiplicity by the abstraction of our
          reason; the latter may be defined as <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">unitas post rem</span></span>, the former as
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">unitas ante rem</span></span>. Finally, we may
          express the distinction between the Idea and the concept, by a
          comparison, thus: the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">concept</span></em> is like a dead receptacle,
          in which, whatever has been put, actually lies side by side, but
          out of which no more can be taken (by analytical judgment) than was
          put in (by synthetical reflection); the (Platonic) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Idea</span></em>,
          on the other hand, develops, in him who has comprehended it, ideas
          which are new as regards the concept of the same name; it resembles
          a living organism, developing itself and possessed of the power of
          reproduction, which brings forth what was not put into it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It follows from
          all that has been said, that the concept, useful as it is in life,
          and serviceable, necessary and productive as it is in science, is
          yet always barren <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page304">[pg
          304]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg304"></a>
          and unfruitful in art. The comprehended Idea, on the contrary, is
          the true and only source of every work of art. In its powerful
          originality it is only derived from life itself, from nature, from
          the world, and that only by the true genius, or by him whose
          momentary inspiration reaches the point of genius. Genuine and
          immortal works of art spring only from such direct apprehension.
          Just because the Idea is and remains object of perception, the
          artist is not conscious in the abstract of the intention and aim of
          his work; not a concept, but an Idea floats before his mind;
          therefore he can give no justification of what he does. He works,
          as people say, from pure feeling, and unconsciously, indeed
          instinctively. On the contrary, imitators, mannerists, <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">imitatores, servum pecus</span></span>, start,
          in art, from the concept; they observe what pleases and affects us
          in true works of art; understand it clearly, fix it in a concept,
          and thus abstractly, and then imitate it, openly or disguisedly,
          with dexterity and intentionally. They suck their nourishment, like
          parasite plants, from the works of others, and like polypi, they
          become the colour of their food. We might carry comparison further,
          and say that they are like machines which mince fine and mingle
          together whatever is put into them, but can never digest it, so
          that the different constituent parts may always be found again if
          they are sought out and separated from the mixture; the man of
          genius alone resembles the organised, assimilating, transforming
          and reproducing body. For he is indeed educated and cultured by his
          predecessors and their works; but he is really fructified only by
          life and the world directly, through the impression of what he
          perceives; therefore the highest culture never interferes with his
          originality. All imitators, all mannerists, apprehend in concepts
          the nature of representative works of art; but concepts can never
          impart inner life to a work. The age, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          the dull multitude of every time, knows only concepts, and sticks
          to them, and therefore receives <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page305">[pg 305]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg305"></a> mannered works of art with ready and loud
          applause: but after a few years these works become insipid, because
          the spirit of the age, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the prevailing concepts,
          in which alone they could take root, have changed. Only true works
          of art, which are drawn directly from nature and life, have eternal
          youth and enduring power, like nature and life themselves. For they
          belong to no age, but to humanity, and as on that account they are
          coldly received by their own age, to which they disdain to link
          themselves closely, and because indirectly and negatively they
          expose the existing errors, they are slowly and unwillingly
          recognised; on the other hand, they cannot grow old, but appear to
          us ever fresh and new down to the latest ages. Then they are no
          longer exposed to neglect and ignorance, for they are crowned and
          sanctioned by the praise of the few men capable of judging, who
          appear singly and rarely in the course of ages,<a href="#note_57" id="noteref_57" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">57</span></span></a> and
          give in their votes, whose slowly growing number constitutes the
          authority, which alone is the judgment-seat we mean when we appeal
          to posterity. It is these successively appearing individuals, for
          the mass of posterity will always be and remain just as perverse
          and dull as the mass of contemporaries always was and always is. We
          read the complaints of great men in every century about the customs
          of their age. They always sound as if they referred to our own age,
          for the race is always the same. At every time and in every art,
          mannerisms have taken the place of the spirit, which was always the
          possession of a few individuals, but mannerisms are just the old
          cast-off garments of the last manifestation of the spirit that
          existed and was recognised. From all this it appears that, as a
          rule, the praise of posterity can only be gained at the cost of the
          praise of one's contemporaries, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vice
          versa</span></span>.<a href="#note_58" id="noteref_58" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">58</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 50. If the aim
          of all art is the communication of the comprehended Idea, which
          through the mind of the artist <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page306">[pg 306]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg306"></a> appears in such a form that it is purged and
          isolated from all that is foreign to it, and may now be grasped by
          the man of weaker comprehension and no productive faculty; if
          further, it is forbidden in art to start from the concept, we shall
          not be able to consent to the intentional and avowed employment of
          a work of art for the expression of a concept; this is the case in
          the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Allegory</span></em>. An allegory is a work of
          art which means something different from what it represents. But
          the object of perception, and consequently also the Idea, expresses
          itself directly and completely, and does not require the medium of
          something else which implies or indicates it. Thus, that which in
          this way is indicated and represented by something entirely
          different, because it cannot itself be made object of perception,
          is always a concept. Therefore through the allegory a conception
          has always to be signified, and consequently the mind of the
          beholder has to be drawn away from the expressed perceptible idea
          to one which is entirely different, abstract and not perceptible,
          and which lies quite outside the work of art. The picture or statue
          is intended to accomplish here what is accomplished far more fully
          by a book. Now, what we hold is the end of art, representation of a
          perceivable, comprehensible Idea, is not here the end. No great
          completeness in the work of art is demanded for what is aimed at
          here. It is only necessary that we should see what the thing is
          meant to be, for, as soon as this has been discovered, the end is
          reached, and the mind is now led away to quite a different kind of
          idea to an abstract conception, which is the end that was in view.
          Allegories in plastic and pictorial art are, therefore, nothing but
          hieroglyphics; the artistic value which they may have as
          perceptible representations, belongs to them not as allegories, but
          otherwise. That the <span class="tei tei-q">“Night”</span> of
          Correggio, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Genius of Fame”</span> of
          Hannibal Caracci, and the <span class="tei tei-q">“Hours”</span> of
          Poussin, are very beautiful pictures, is to be separated altogether
          from the fact that they are <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page307">[pg 307]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg307"></a> allegories. As allegories they do not
          accomplish more than a legend, indeed rather less. We are here
          again reminded of the distinction drawn above between the real and
          the nominal significance of a picture. The nominal is here the
          allegorical as such, for example, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Genius of Fame.”</span> The real is what is actually
          represented, in this case a beautiful winged youth, surrounded by
          beautiful boys; this expresses an Idea. But this real significance
          affects us only so long as we forget the nominal, allegorical
          significance; if we think of the latter, we forsake the perception,
          and the mind is occupied with an abstract conception; but the
          transition from the Idea to the conception is always a fall.
          Indeed, that nominal significance, that allegorical intention,
          often injures the real significance, the perceptible truth. For
          example, the unnatural light in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Night”</span> of Correggio, which, though beautifully
          executed, has yet a merely allegorical motive, and is really
          impossible. If then an allegorical picture has artistic value, it
          is quite separate from and independent of what it accomplishes as
          allegory. Such a work of art serves two ends at once, the
          expression of a conception and the expression of an Idea. Only the
          latter can be an end of art; the other is a foreign end, the
          trifling amusement of making a picture also do service as a legend,
          as a hieroglyphic, invented for the pleasure of those to whom the
          true nature of art can never appeal. It is the same thing as when a
          work of art is also a useful implement of some kind, in which case
          it also serves two ends; for example, a statue which is at the same
          time a candelabrum or a caryatide; or a bas-relief, which is also
          the shield of Achilles. True lovers of art will allow neither the
          one nor the other. It is true that an allegorical picture may,
          because of this quality, produce a vivid impression upon the
          feelings; but when this is the case, a legend would under the same
          circumstances produce the same effect. For example, if the desire
          of fame were firmly and lastingly <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page308">[pg 308]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg308"></a> rooted in the heart of a man, because he
          regarded it as his rightful possession, which is only withheld from
          him so long as he has not produced the charter of his ownership;
          and if the Genius of Fame, with his laurel crown, were to appear to
          such a man, his whole mind would be excited, and his powers called
          into activity; but the same effect would be produced if he were
          suddenly to see the word <span class="tei tei-q">“fame,”</span> in
          large distinct letters on the wall. Or if a man has made known a
          truth, which is of importance either as a maxim for practical life,
          or as insight for science, but it has not been believed; an
          allegorical picture representing time as it lifts the veil, and
          discloses the naked figure of Truth, will affect him powerfully;
          but the same effect would be produced by the legend: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">Le temps découvre la
          vérité.</span></span>”</span> For what really produces the effect
          here is the abstract thought, not the object of perception.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If then, in
          accordance with what has been said, allegory in plastic and
          pictorial art is a mistaken effort, serving an end which is
          entirely foreign to art, it becomes quite unbearable when it leads
          so far astray that the representation of forced and violently
          introduced subtilties degenerates into absurdity. Such, for
          example, is a tortoise, to represent feminine seclusion; the
          downward glance of Nemesis into the drapery of her bosom,
          signifying that she can see into what is hidden; the explanation of
          Bellori that Hannibal Carracci represents voluptuousness clothed in
          a yellow robe, because he wishes to indicate that her lovers soon
          fade and become yellow as straw. If there is absolutely no
          connection between the representation and the conception signified
          by it, founded on subsumption under the concept, or association of
          Ideas; but the signs and the things signified are combined in a
          purely conventional manner, by positive, accidentally introduced
          laws; then I call this degenerate kind of allegory <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Symbolism</span></em>. Thus the rose is the
          symbol of secrecy, the laurel is the symbol of fame, the palm is
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page309">[pg 309]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg309"></a> the symbol of peace,
          the scallop-shell is the symbol of pilgrimage, the cross is the
          symbol of the Christian religion. To this class also belongs all
          significance of mere colour, as yellow is the colour of falseness,
          and blue is the colour of fidelity. Such symbols may often be of
          use in life, but their value is foreign to art. They are simply to
          be regarded as hieroglyphics, or like Chinese word-writing, and
          really belong to the same class as armorial bearings, the bush that
          indicates a public-house, the key of the chamberlain, or the
          leather of the mountaineer. If, finally, certain historical or
          mythical persons, or personified conceptions, are represented by
          certain fixed symbols, these are properly called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">emblems</span></em>. Such are the beasts of
          the Evangelist, the owl of Minerva, the apple of Paris, the Anchor
          of Hope, &amp;c. For the most part, however, we understand by
          emblems those simple allegorical representations explained by a
          motto, which are meant to express a moral truth, and of which large
          collections have been made by J. Camerarius, Alciatus, and others.
          They form the transition to poetical allegory, of which we shall
          have more to say later. Greek sculpture devotes itself to the
          perception, and therefore it is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">æsthetical</span></em>; Indian sculpture
          devotes itself to the conception, and therefore it is merely
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">symbolical</span></em>.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This conclusion
          in regard to allegory, which is founded on our consideration of the
          nature of art and quite consistent with it, is directly opposed to
          the opinion of Winckelmann, who, far from explaining allegory, as
          we do, as something quite foreign to the end of art, and often
          interfering with it, always speaks in favour of it, and indeed
          (Works, vol. i. p. 55) places the highest aim of art in the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“representation of universal conceptions,
          and non-sensuous things.”</span> We leave it to every one to adhere
          to whichever view he pleases. Only the truth became very clear to
          me from these and similar views of Winckelmann connected with his
          peculiar metaphysic of the beautiful, that one may have the
          greatest susceptibility <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page310">[pg
          310]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg310"></a>
          for artistic beauty, and the soundest judgment in regard to it,
          without being able to give an abstract and strictly philosophical
          justification of the nature of the beautiful; just as one may be
          very noble and virtuous, and may have a tender conscience, which
          decides with perfect accuracy in particular cases, without on that
          account being in a position to investigate and explain in the
          abstract the ethical significance of action.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Allegory has an
          entirely different relation to poetry from that which it has to
          plastic and pictorial art, and although it is to be rejected in the
          latter, it is not only permissible, but very serviceable to the
          former. For in plastic and pictorial art it leads away from what is
          perceptibly given, the proper object of all art, to abstract
          thoughts; but in poetry the relation is reversed; for here what is
          directly given in words is the concept, and the first aim is to
          lead from this to the object of perception, the representation of
          which must be undertaken by the imagination of the hearer. If in
          plastic and pictorial art we are led from what is immediately given
          to something else, this must always be a conception, because here
          only the abstract cannot be given directly; but a conception must
          never be the source, and its communication must never be the end of
          a work of art. In poetry, on the contrary, the conception is the
          material, the immediately given, and therefore we may very well
          leave it, in order to call up perceptions which are quite
          different, and in which the end is reached. Many a conception or
          abstract thought may be quite indispensable to the connection of a
          poem, which is yet, in itself and directly, quite incapable of
          being perceived; and then it is often made perceptible by means of
          some example which is subsumed under it. This takes place in every
          trope, every metaphor, simile, parable, and allegory, all of which
          differ only in the length and completeness of their expression.
          Therefore, in the arts which employ language as their medium,
          similes and allegories are of striking effect. How beautifully
          Cervantes <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page311">[pg
          311]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg311"></a>
          says of sleep in order to express the fact that it frees us from
          all spiritual and bodily suffering, <span class="tei tei-q">“It is
          a mantle that covers all mankind.”</span> How beautifully Kleist
          expresses allegorically the thought that philosophers and men of
          science enlighten mankind, in the line, <span class="tei tei-q">“Those whose midnight lamp lights the world.”</span>
          How strongly and sensuously Homer describes the harmful Ate when he
          says: <span class="tei tei-q">“She has tender feet, for she walks
          not on the hard earth, but treads on the heads of men”</span> (Il.
          xix. 91.) How forcibly we are struck by Menenius Agrippa's fable of
          the belly and the limbs, addressed to the people of Rome when they
          seceded. How beautifully Plato's figure of the Cave, at the
          beginning of the seventh book of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Republic”</span> to which we have already referred,
          expresses a very abstract philosophical dogma. The fable of
          Persephone is also to be regarded as a deeply significant allegory
          of philosophical tendency, for she became subject to the nether
          world by tasting a pomegranate. This becomes peculiarly
          enlightening from Goethe's treatment of the fable, as an episode in
          the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Triumph der Empfindsamkeit</span></span>,
          which is beyond all praise. Three detailed allegorical works are
          known to me, one, open and avowed, is the incomparable <span class="tei tei-q">“Criticon”</span> of Balthasar Gracian. It consists of
          a great rich web of connected and highly ingenious allegories, that
          serve here as the fair clothing of moral truths, to which he thus
          imparts the most perceptible form, and astonishes us by the
          richness of his invention. The two others are concealed allegories,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Don Quixote”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“Gulliver's Travels.”</span> The first is an allegory
          of the life of every man, who will not, like others, be careful,
          merely for his own welfare, but follows some objective, ideal end,
          which has taken possession of his thoughts and will; and certainly,
          in this world, he has then a strange appearance. In the case of
          Gulliver we have only to take everything physical as spiritual or
          intellectual, in order to see what the <span class="tei tei-q">“satirical rogue,”</span> as Hamlet would call him,
          meant by it. Such, then, in the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page312">[pg 312]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg312"></a> poetical allegory, the conception is always
          the given, which it tries to make perceptible by means of a
          picture; it may sometimes be expressed or assisted by a painted
          picture. Such a picture will not be regarded as a work of art, but
          only as a significant symbol, and it makes no claim to pictorial,
          but only to poetical worth. Such is that beautiful allegorical
          vignette of Lavater's, which must be so heartening to every
          defender of truth: a hand holding a light is stung by a wasp, while
          gnats are burning themselves in the flame above; underneath is the
          motto:</p>

          the inscription—</p>

</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Finally, of this
          kind is an old German genealogical tree, in which the last
          representative of a very ancient family thus expresses his
          determination to live his life to the end in abstinence and perfect
          chastity, and therefore to let his race die out; he represents
          himself at the root of the high-branching tree cutting it over
          himself with shears. In general all those symbols referred to
          above, commonly called emblems, which might also be defined as
          short painted fables with obvious morals, belong to this class.
          Allegories of this kind are always to be regarded as belonging to
          poetry, not to painting, and as justified thereby; moreover, the
          pictorial execution is here always a matter of secondary
          importance, and no more is demanded of it than that it shall
          represent the thing so that we can recognise it. But in poetry, as
          in plastic art, the allegory passes into the symbol if there is
          merely <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page313">[pg
          313]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg313"></a>
          an arbitrary connection between what it presented to perception and
          the abstract significance of it. For as all symbolism rests, at
          bottom, on an agreement, the symbol has this among other
          disadvantages, that in time its meaning is forgotten, and then it
          is dumb. Who would guess why the fish is a symbol of Christianity
          if he did not know? Only a Champollion; for it is entirely a
          phonetic hieroglyphic. Therefore, as a poetical allegory, the
          Revelation of John stands much in the same position as the reliefs
          with <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Magnus Deus sol Mithra</span></span>, which
          are still constantly being explained.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 51. If now,
          with the exposition which has been given of art in general, we turn
          from plastic and pictorial art to poetry, we shall have no doubt
          that its aim also is the revelation of the Ideas, the grades of the
          objectification of will, and the communication of them to the
          hearer with the distinctness and vividness with which the poetical
          sense comprehends them. Ideas are essentially perceptible; if,
          therefore, in poetry only abstract conceptions are directly
          communicated through words, it is yet clearly the intention to make
          the hearer perceive the Ideas of life in the representatives of
          these conceptions, and this can only take place through the
          assistance of his own imagination. But in order to set the
          imagination to work for the accomplishment of this end, the
          abstract conceptions, which are the immediate material of poetry as
          of dry prose, must be so arranged that their spheres intersect each
          other in such a way that none of them can remain in its abstract
          universality; but, instead of it, a perceptible representative
          appears to the imagination; and this is always further modified by
          the words of the poet according to what his intention may be. As
          the chemist obtains solid precipitates by combining perfectly clear
          and transparent fluids; the poet understands how to precipitate, as
          it were, the concrete, the individual, the perceptible idea, out of
          the abstract and transparent universality of the concepts by the
          manner in which he <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page314">[pg
          314]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg314"></a>
          combines them. For the Idea can only be known by perception; and
          knowledge of the Idea is the end of art. The skill of a master, in
          poetry as in chemistry, enables us always to obtain the precise
          precipitate we intended. This end is assisted by the numerous
          epithets in poetry, by means of which the universality of every
          concept is narrowed more and more till we reach the perceptible.
          Homer attaches to almost every substantive an adjective, whose
          concept intersects and considerably diminishes the sphere of the
          concept of the substantive, which is thus brought so much the
          nearer to perception: for example—</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Rhythm and rhyme
          are quite peculiar aids to poetry. I can give no other explanation
          of their incredibly powerful effect than that our faculties of
          perception have received from time, to which they are essentially
          bound, some quality on account of which we inwardly follow, and, as
          it were, consent to each regularly recurring sound. In this way
          rhythm and rhyme are partly a means of holding our attention,
          because we willingly follow the poem read, and partly they produce
          in us a blind consent to what is read prior to any judgment, and
          this gives the poem a certain emphatic power of convincing
          independent of all reasons.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From the general
          nature of the material, that is, the concepts, which poetry uses to
          communicate the Ideas, the extent of its province is very great.
          The whole of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page315">[pg
          315]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg315"></a>
          nature, the Ideas of all grades, can be represented by means of it,
          for it proceeds according to the Idea it has to impart, so that its
          representations are sometimes descriptive, sometimes narrative, and
          sometimes directly dramatic. If, in the representation of the lower
          grades of the objectivity of will, plastic and pictorial art
          generally surpass it, because lifeless nature, and even brute
          nature, reveals almost its whole being in a single well-chosen
          moment; man, on the contrary, so far as he does not express himself
          by the mere form and expression of his person, but through a series
          of actions and the accompanying thoughts and emotions, is the
          principal object of poetry, in which no other art can compete with
          it, for here the progress or movement which cannot be represented
          in plastic or pictorial art just suits its purpose.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The revelation
          of the Idea, which is the highest grade of the objectivity of will,
          the representation of man in the connected series of his efforts
          and actions, is thus the great problem of poetry. It is true that
          both experience and history teach us to know man; yet oftener men
          than man, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, they give us empirical
          notes of the behaviour of men to each other, from which we may
          frame rules for our own conduct, oftener than they afford us deep
          glimpses of the inner nature of man. The latter function, however,
          is by no means entirely denied them; but as often as it is the
          nature of mankind itself that discloses itself to us in history or
          in our own experience, we have comprehended our experience, and the
          historian has comprehended history, with artistic eyes, poetically,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, according to the Idea, not
          the phenomenon, in its inner nature, not in its relations. Our own
          experience is the indispensable condition of understanding poetry
          as of understanding history; for it is, so to speak, the dictionary
          of the language that both speak. But history is related to poetry
          as portrait-painting is related to historical painting; the one
          gives us the true in the individual, the other the true in the
          universal; the one has the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page316">[pg 316]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg316"></a> truth of the phenomenon, and can therefore
          verify it from the phenomenal, the other has the truth of the Idea,
          which can be found in no particular phenomenon, but yet speaks to
          us from them all. The poet from deliberate choice represents
          significant characters in significant situations; the historian
          takes both as they come. Indeed, he must regard and select the
          circumstances and the persons, not with reference to their inward
          and true significance, which expresses the Idea, but according to
          the outward, apparent, and relatively important significance with
          regard to the connection and the consequences. He must consider
          nothing in and for itself in its essential character and
          expression, but must look at everything in its relations, in its
          connection, in its influence upon what follows, and especially upon
          its own age. Therefore he will not overlook an action of a king,
          though of little significance, and in itself quite common, because
          it has results and influence. And, on the other hand, actions of
          the highest significance of particular and very eminent individuals
          are not to be recorded by him if they have no consequences. For his
          treatment follows the principle of sufficient reason, and
          apprehends the phenomenon, of which this principle is the form. But
          the poet comprehends the Idea, the inner nature of man apart from
          all relations, outside all time, the adequate objectivity of the
          thing-in-itself, at its highest grade. Even in that method of
          treatment which is necessary for the historian, the inner nature
          and significance of the phenomena, the kernel of all these shells,
          can never be entirely lost. He who seeks for it, at any rate, may
          find it and recognise it. Yet that which is significant in itself,
          not in its relations, the real unfolding of the Idea, will be found
          far more accurately and distinctly in poetry than in history, and,
          therefore, however paradoxical it may sound, far more really
          genuine inner truth is to be attributed to poetry than to history.
          For the historian must accurately follow the particular event
          according to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page317">[pg
          317]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg317"></a>
          life, as it develops itself in time in the manifold tangled chains
          of causes and effects. It is, however, impossible that he can have
          all the data for this; he cannot have seen all and discovered all.
          He is forsaken at every moment by the original of his picture, or a
          false one substitutes itself for it, and this so constantly that I
          think I may assume that in all history the false outweighs the
          true. The poet, on the contrary, has comprehended the Idea of man
          from some definite side which is to be represented; thus it is the
          nature of his own self that objectifies itself in it for him. His
          knowledge, as we explained above when speaking of sculpture, is
          half <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span>; his
          ideal stands before his mind firm, distinct, brightly illuminated,
          and cannot forsake him; therefore he shows us, in the mirror of his
          mind, the Idea pure and distinct, and his delineation of it down to
          the minutest particular is true as life itself.<a href="#note_59" id="noteref_59" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">59</span></span></a> The
          great ancient historians are, therefore, in those particulars in
          which their data fail them, for example, in the speeches of their
          heroes—poets; indeed their whole manner of handling their material
          approaches <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page318">[pg
          318]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg318"></a>
          to the epic. But this gives their representations unity, and
          enables them to retain inner truth, even when outward truth was not
          accessible, or indeed was falsified. And as we compared history to
          portrait-painting, in contradistinction to poetry, which
          corresponds to historical painting, we find that Winckelmann's
          maxim, that the portrait ought to be the ideal of the individual,
          was followed by the ancient historians, for they represent the
          individual in such a way as to bring out that side of the Idea of
          man which is expressed in it. Modern historians, on the contrary,
          with few exceptions, give us in general only <span class="tei tei-q">“a dust-bin and a lumber-room, and at the most a
          chronicle of the principal political events.”</span> Therefore,
          whoever desires to know man in his inner nature, identical in all
          its phenomena and developments, to know him according to the Idea,
          will find that the works of the great, immortal poet present a far
          truer, more distinct picture, than the historians can ever give.
          For even the best of the historians are, as poets, far from the
          first; and moreover their hands are tied. In this aspect the
          relation between the historian and the poet may be illustrated by
          the following comparison. The mere, pure historian, who works only
          according to data, is like a man, who without any knowledge of
          mathematics, has investigated the relations of certain figures,
          which he has accidentally found, by measuring them; and the problem
          thus empirically solved is affected of course by all the errors of
          the drawn figure. The poet, on the other hand, is like the
          mathematician, who constructs these relations <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span> in pure perception, and
          expresses them not as they actually are in the drawn figure, but as
          they are in the Idea, which the drawing is intended to render for
          the senses. Therefore Schiller says:—</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Indeed I must
          attribute greater value to biographies, and especially to
          autobiographies, in relation to the knowledge of the nature of man,
          than to history proper, at least as it is commonly handled. Partly
          because in the former the data can be collected more accurately and
          completely than in the latter; partly, because in history proper,
          it is not so much men as nations and heroes that act, and the
          individuals who do appear, seem so far off, surrounded with such
          pomp and circumstance, clothed in the stiff robes of state, or
          heavy, inflexible armour, that it is really hard through all this
          to recognise the human movements. On the other hand, the life of
          the individual when described with truth, in a narrow sphere, shows
          the conduct of men in all its forms and subtilties, the excellence,
          the virtue, and even holiness of a few, the perversity, meanness,
          and knavery of most, the dissolute profligacy of some. Besides, in
          the only aspect we are considering here, that of the inner
          significance of the phenomenal, it is quite the same whether the
          objects with which the action is concerned, are, relatively
          considered, trifling or important, farm-houses or kingdoms: for all
          these things in themselves are without significance, and obtain it
          only in so far as the will is moved by them. The motive has
          significance only through its relation to the will, while the
          relation which it has as a thing to other things like itself, does
          not concern us here. As a circle of one inch in diameter, and a
          circle of forty million miles in diameter, have precisely the same
          geometrical properties, so are the events and the history of a
          village and a kingdom essentially the same; and we may study and
          learn to know mankind as well in the one as in the other. It is
          also a mistake to suppose that autobiographies are full of deceit
          and dissimulation. On the contrary, lying (though always possible)
          is perhaps more difficult there than elsewhere. Dissimulation is
          easiest in mere conversation; indeed, though it may sound
          paradoxical, it is really more <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page320">[pg 320]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg320"></a> difficult even in a letter. For in the case
          of a letter the writer is alone, and looks into himself, and not
          out on the world, so that what is strange and distant does not
          easily approach him; and he has not the test of the impression made
          upon another before his eyes. But the receiver of the letter
          peruses it quietly in a mood unknown to the writer, reads it
          repeatedly and at different times, and thus easily finds out the
          concealed intention. We also get to know an author as a man most
          easily from his books, because all these circumstances act here
          still more strongly and permanently. And in an autobiography it is
          so difficult to dissimulate, that perhaps there does not exist a
          single one that is not, as a whole, more true, than any history
          that ever was written. The man who writes his own life surveys it
          as a whole, the particular becomes small, the near becomes distant,
          the distant becomes near again, the motives that influenced him
          shrink; he seats himself at the confessional, and has done so of
          his own free will; the spirit of lying does not so easily take hold
          of him here, for there is also in every man an inclination to truth
          which has first to be overcome whenever he lies, and which here has
          taken up a specially strong position. The relation between
          biography and the history of nations may be made clear for
          perception by means of the following comparison: History shows us
          mankind as a view from a high mountain shows us nature; we see much
          at a time, wide stretches, great masses, but nothing is distinct
          nor recognisable in all the details of its own peculiar nature. On
          the other hand, the representation of the life of the individual
          shows us the man, as we see nature if we go about among her trees,
          plants, rocks, and waters. But in landscape-painting, in which the
          artist lets us look at nature with his eyes, the knowledge of the
          Ideas, and the condition of pure will-less knowing, which is
          demanded by these, is made much easier for us; and, in the same
          way, poetry is far superior both to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page321">[pg 321]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg321"></a> history and biography, in the representation
          of the Ideas which may be looked for in all three. For here also
          genius holds up to us the magic glass, in which all that is
          essential and significant appears before us collected and placed in
          the clearest light, and what is accidental and foreign is left
          out.<a href="#note_60" id="noteref_60" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">60</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
          representation of the Idea of man, which is the work of the poet,
          may be performed, so that what is represented is also the
          representer. This is the case in lyrical poetry, in songs, properly
          so called, in which the poet only perceives vividly his own state
          and describes it. Thus a certain subjectivity is essential to this
          kind of poetry from the nature of its object. Again, what is to be
          represented may be entirely different from him who represents it,
          as is the case in all other kinds of poetry, in which the poet more
          or less conceals himself behind his representation, and at last
          disappears altogether. In the ballad the poet still expresses to
          some extent his own state through the tone and proportion of the
          whole; therefore, though much more objective than the lyric, it has
          yet something subjective. This becomes less in the idyll, still
          less in the romantic poem, almost entirely disappears in the true
          epic, and even to the last vestige in the drama, which is the most
          objective and, in more than one respect, the completest and most
          difficult form of poetry. The lyrical form of poetry is
          consequently the easiest, and although art, as a whole, belongs
          only to the true man of genius, who so rarely appears, even a man
          who is not in general very remarkable may produce a beautiful song
          if, by actual strong excitement from without, some inspiration
          raises his mental powers; for all that is required for this is a
          lively perception of his own state at a moment of emotional
          excitement. This is proved by the existence of many single songs by
          individuals who have otherwise remained unknown; especially the
          German national songs, of which we have an exquisite collection
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page322">[pg 322]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg322"></a> in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Wunderhorn;”</span> and also by innumerable love-songs
          and other songs of the people in all languages;—for to seize the
          mood of a moment and embody it in a song is the whole achievement
          of this kind of poetry. Yet in the lyrics of true poets the inner
          nature of all mankind is reflected, and all that millions of past,
          present, and future men have found, or will find, in the same
          situations, which are constantly recurring, finds its exact
          expression in them. And because these situations, by constant
          recurrence, are permanent as man himself and always call up the
          same sensations, the lyrical productions of genuine poets remain
          through thousands of years true, powerful, and fresh. But if the
          poet is always the universal man, then all that has ever moved a
          human heart, all that human nature in any situation has ever
          produced from itself, all that dwells and broods in any human
          breast—is his theme and his material, and also all the rest of
          nature. Therefore the poet may just as well sing of voluptuousness
          as of mysticism, be Anacreon or Angelus Silesius, write tragedies
          or comedies, represent the sublime or the common mind—according to
          humour or vocation. And no one has the right to prescribe to the
          poet what he ought to be—noble and sublime, moral, pious,
          Christian, one thing or another, still less to reproach him because
          he is one thing and not another. He is the mirror of mankind, and
          brings to its consciousness what it feels and does.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If we now
          consider more closely the nature of the lyric proper, and select as
          examples exquisite and pure models, not those that approach in any
          way to some other form of poetry, such as the ballad, the elegy,
          the hymn, the epigram, &amp;c., we shall find that the peculiar
          nature of the lyric, in the narrowest sense, is this: It is the
          subject of will, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, his own volition, which
          the consciousness of the singer feels; often as a released and
          satisfied desire (joy), but still oftener as a restricted desire
          (grief), always as an emotion, a passion, a moved frame of mind.
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page323">[pg 323]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg323"></a> Besides this,
          however, and along with it, by the sight of surrounding nature, the
          singer becomes conscious of himself as the subject of pure,
          will-less knowing, whose unbroken blissful peace now appears, in
          contrast to the stress of desire which is always restricted and
          always needy. The feeling of this contrast, this alternation, is
          really what the lyric as a whole expresses, and what principally
          constitutes the lyrical state of mind. In it pure knowing comes to
          us, as it were, to deliver us from desire and its stain; we follow,
          but only for an instant; desire, the remembrance of our own
          personal ends, tears us anew from peaceful contemplation; yet ever
          again the next beautiful surrounding in which the pure will-less
          knowledge presents itself to us, allures us away from desire.
          Therefore, in the lyric and the lyrical mood, desire (the personal
          interest of the ends), and pure perception of the surrounding
          presented, are wonderfully mingled with each other; connections
          between them are sought for and imagined; the subjective
          disposition, the affection of the will, imparts its own hue to the
          perceived surrounding, and conversely, the surroundings communicate
          the reflex of their colour to the will. The true lyric is the
          expression of the whole of this mingled and divided state of mind.
          In order to make clear by examples this abstract analysis of a
          frame of mind that is very far from all abstraction, any of the
          immortal songs of Goethe may be taken. As specially adapted for
          this end I shall recommend only a few: <span class="tei tei-q">“The
          Shepherd's Lament,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Welcome and
          Farewell,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“To the Moon,”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“On the Lake,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Autumn;”</span> also the songs in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Wunderhorn”</span> are excellent examples;
          particularly the one which begins, <span class="tei tei-q">“O
          Bremen, I must now leave thee.”</span> As a comical and happy
          parody of the lyrical character a song of Voss strikes me as
          remarkable. It describes the feeling of a drunk plumber falling
          from a tower, who observes in passing that the clock on the tower
          is at half-past eleven, a remark which is quite foreign to his
          condition, and thus <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page324">[pg
          324]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg324"></a>
          belongs to knowledge free from will. Whoever accepts the view that
          has been expressed of the lyrical frame of mind, will also allow,
          that it is the sensuous and poetical knowledge of the principle
          which I established in my essay on the Principle of Sufficient
          Reason, and have also referred to in this work, that the identity
          of the subject of knowing with that of willing may be called the
          miracle κατ᾽ εξοχην; so that the poetical effect of the lyric rests
          finally on the truth of that principle. In the course of life these
          two subjects, or, in popular language, head and heart, are ever
          becoming further apart; men are always separating more between
          their subjective feeling and their objective knowledge. In the
          child the two are still entirely blended together; it scarcely
          knows how to distinguish itself from its surroundings, it is at one
          with them. In the young man all perception chiefly affects feeling
          and mood, and even mingles with it, as Byron very beautifully
          expresses—</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is why the
          youth clings so closely to the perceptible and outward side of
          things; this is why he is only fit for lyrical poetry, and only the
          full-grown man is capable of the drama. The old man we can think of
          as at the most an epic poet, like Ossian, and Homer, for narration
          is characteristic of old age.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the more
          objective kinds of poetry, especially in the romance, the epic, and
          the drama, the end, the revelation of the Idea of man, is
          principally attained by two means, by true and profound
          representation of significant characters, and by the invention of
          pregnant situations in which they disclose themselves. For as it is
          incumbent upon the chemist not only to exhibit the simple elements,
          pure and genuine, and their principal compounds, but also to expose
          them to the influence of such reagents as will <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page325">[pg 325]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg325"></a> clearly and strikingly bring out their
          peculiar qualities, so is it incumbent on the poet not only to
          present to us significant characters truly and faithfully as nature
          itself; but, in order that we may get to know them, he must place
          them in those situations in which their peculiar qualities will
          fully unfold themselves, and appear distinctly in sharp outline;
          situations which are therefore called significant. In real life,
          and in history, situations of this kind are rarely brought about by
          chance, and they stand alone, lost and concealed in the multitude
          of those which are insignificant. The complete significance of the
          situations ought to distinguish the romance, the epic, and the
          drama from real life as completely as the arrangement and selection
          of significant characters. In both, however, absolute truth is a
          necessary condition of their effect, and want of unity in the
          characters, contradiction either of themselves or of the nature of
          humanity in general, as well as impossibility, or very great
          improbability in the events, even in mere accessories, offend just
          as much in poetry as badly drawn figures, false perspective, or
          wrong lighting in painting. For both in poetry and painting we
          demand the faithful mirror of life, of man, of the world, only made
          more clear by the representation, and more significant by the
          arrangement. For there is only one end of all the arts, the
          representation of the Ideas; and their essential difference lies
          simply in the different grades of the objectification of will to
          which the Ideas that are to be represented belong. This also
          determines the material of the representation. Thus the arts which
          are most widely separated may yet throw light on each other. For
          example, in order to comprehend fully the Ideas of water it is not
          sufficient to see it in the quiet pond or in the evenly-flowing
          stream; but these Ideas disclose themselves fully only when the
          water appears under all circumstances and exposed to all kinds of
          obstacles. The effects of the varied circumstances and obstacles
          give it the opportunity of fully <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page326">[pg 326]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg326"></a> exhibiting all its qualities. This is why we
          find it beautiful when it tumbles, rushes, and foams, or leaps into
          the air, or falls in a cataract of spray; or, lastly, if
          artificially confined it springs up in a fountain. Thus showing
          itself different under different circumstances, it yet always
          faithfully asserts its character; it is just as natural to it to
          spout up as to lie in glassy stillness; it is as ready for the one
          as for the other as soon as the circumstances appear. Now, what the
          engineer achieves with the fluid matter of water, the architect
          achieves with the rigid matter of stone, and just this the epic or
          dramatic poet achieves with the Idea of man. Unfolding and
          rendering distinct the Idea expressing itself in the object of
          every art, the Idea of the will which objectifies itself at each
          grade, is the common end of all the arts. The life of man, as it
          shows itself for the most part in the real world, is like the
          water, as it is generally seen in the pond and the river; but in
          the epic, the romance, the tragedy, selected characters are placed
          in those circumstances in which all their special qualities unfold
          themselves, the depths of the human heart are revealed, and become
          visible in extraordinary and very significant actions. Thus poetry
          objectifies the Idea of man, an Idea which has the peculiarity of
          expressing itself in highly individual characters.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Tragedy is to be
          regarded, and is recognised as the summit of poetical art, both on
          account of the greatness of its effect and the difficulty of its
          achievement. It is very significant for our whole system, and well
          worthy of observation, that the end of this highest poetical
          achievement is the representation of the terrible side of life. The
          unspeakable pain, the wail of humanity, the triumph of evil, the
          scornful mastery of chance, and the irretrievable fall of the just
          and innocent, is here presented to us; and in this lies a
          significant hint of the nature of the world and of existence. It is
          the strife of will with itself, which here, completely unfolded at
          the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page327">[pg 327]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg327"></a> highest grade of its
          objectivity, comes into fearful prominence. It becomes visible in
          the suffering of men, which is now introduced, partly through
          chance and error, which appear as the rulers of the world,
          personified as fate, on account of their insidiousness, which even
          reaches the appearance of design; partly it proceeds from man
          himself, through the self-mortifying efforts of a few, through the
          wickedness and perversity of most. It is one and the same will that
          lives and appears in them all, but whose phenomena fight against
          each other and destroy each other. In one individual it appears
          powerfully, in another more weakly; in one more subject to reason,
          and softened by the light of knowledge, in another less so, till at
          last, in some single case, this knowledge, purified and heightened
          by suffering itself, reaches the point at which the phenomenon, the
          veil of Mâya, no longer deceives it. It sees through the form of
          the phenomenon, the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium
          individuationis</span></span>. The egoism which rests on this
          perishes with it, so that now the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">motives</span></em>
          that were so powerful before have lost their might, and instead of
          them the complete knowledge of the nature of the world, which has a
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">quieting</span></em> effect on the will,
          produces resignation, the surrender not merely of life, but of the
          very will to live. Thus we see in tragedies the noblest men, after
          long conflict and suffering, at last renounce the ends they have so
          keenly followed, and all the pleasures of life for ever, or else
          freely and joyfully surrender life itself. So is it with the
          steadfast prince of Calderon; with Gretchen in <span class="tei tei-q">“Faust;”</span> with Hamlet, whom his friend Horatio
          would willingly follow, but is bade remain a while, and in this
          harsh world draw his breath in pain, to tell the story of Hamlet,
          and clear his memory; so also is it with the Maid of Orleans, the
          Bride of Messina; they all die purified by suffering, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          after the will to live which was formerly in them is dead. In the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Mohammed”</span> of Voltaire this is
          actually expressed in the concluding <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page328">[pg 328]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg328"></a> words which the dying Palmira addresses to
          Mohammad: <span class="tei tei-q">“The world is for tyrants:
          live!”</span> On the other hand, the demand for so-called poetical
          justice rests on entire misconception of the nature of tragedy,
          and, indeed, of the nature of the world itself. It boldly appears
          in all its dulness in the criticisms which Dr. Samuel Johnson made
          on particular plays of Shakespeare, for he very naïvely laments its
          entire absence. And its absence is certainly obvious, for in what
          has Ophelia, Desdemona, or Cordelia offended? But only the dull,
          optimistic, Protestant-rationalistic, or peculiarly Jewish view of
          life will make the demand for poetical justice, and find
          satisfaction in it. The true sense of tragedy is the deeper
          insight, that it is not his own individual sins that the hero
          atones for, but original sin, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the crime of existence
          itself:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">as Calderon
          exactly expresses it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I shall allow
          myself only one remark, more closely concerning the treatment of
          tragedy. The representation of a great misfortune is alone
          essential to tragedy. But the many different ways in which this is
          introduced by the poet may be brought under three specific
          conceptions. It may happen by means of a character of extraordinary
          wickedness, touching the utmost limits of possibility, who becomes
          the author of the misfortune; examples of this kind are Richard
          III., Iago in <span class="tei tei-q">“Othello,”</span> Shylock in
          <span class="tei tei-q">“The Merchant of Venice,”</span> Franz
          Moor, Phædra of Euripides, Creon in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Antigone,”</span> &amp;c., &amp;c. Secondly, it may
          happen through blind fate, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, chance and error; a true
          pattern of this kind is the Œdipus Rex of Sophocles, the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Trachiniæ”</span> also; and in general
          most of the tragedies of the ancients belong <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page329">[pg 329]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg329"></a> to this class. Among modern tragedies,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Romeo and Juliet,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Tancred”</span> by Voltaire, and <span class="tei tei-q">“The Bride of Messina,”</span> are examples. Lastly,
          the misfortune may be brought about by the mere position of the
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">dramatis personæ</span></span> with regard to
          each other, through their relations; so that there is no need
          either for a tremendous error or an unheard-of accident, nor yet
          for a character whose wickedness reaches the limits of human
          possibility; but characters of ordinary morality, under
          circumstances such as often occur, are so situated with regard to
          each other that their position compels them, knowingly and with
          their eyes open, to do each other the greatest injury, without any
          one of them being entirely in the wrong. This last kind of tragedy
          seems to me far to surpass the other two, for it shows us the
          greatest misfortune, not as an exception, not as something
          occasioned by rare circumstances or monstrous characters, but as
          arising easily and of itself out of the actions and characters of
          men, indeed almost as essential to them, and thus brings it
          terribly near to us. In the other two kinds we may look on the
          prodigious fate and the horrible wickedness as terrible powers
          which certainly threaten us, but only from afar, which we may very
          well escape without taking refuge in renunciation. But in the last
          kind of tragedy we see that those powers which destroy happiness
          and life are such that their path to us also is open at every
          moment; we see the greatest sufferings brought about by
          entanglements that our fate might also partake of, and through
          actions that perhaps we also are capable of performing, and so
          could not complain of injustice; then shuddering we feel ourselves
          already in the midst of hell. This last kind of tragedy is also the
          most difficult of achievement; for the greatest effect has to be
          produced in it with the least use of means and causes of movement,
          merely through the position and distribution of the characters;
          therefore even in many of the best tragedies this difficulty is
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page330">[pg 330]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg330"></a> evaded. Yet one
          tragedy may be referred to as a perfect model of this kind, a
          tragedy which in other respects is far surpassed by more than one
          work of the same great master; it is <span class="tei tei-q">“Clavigo.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Hamlet”</span> belongs to a certain extent to this
          class, as far as the relation of Hamlet to Laertes and Ophelia is
          concerned. <span class="tei tei-q">“Wallenstein”</span> has also
          this excellence. <span class="tei tei-q">“Faust”</span> belongs
          entirely to this class, if we regard the events connected with
          Gretchen and her brother as the principal action; also the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Cid”</span> of Corneille, only that it
          lacks the tragic conclusion, while on the contrary the analogous
          relation of Max to Thecla has it.<a href="#note_61" id="noteref_61" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">61</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 52. Now that
          we have considered all the fine arts in the general way that is
          suitable to our point of view, beginning with architecture, the
          peculiar end of which is to elucidate the objectification of will
          at the lowest grades of its visibility, in which it shows itself as
          the dumb unconscious tendency of the mass in accordance with laws,
          and yet already reveals a breach of the unity of will with itself
          in a conflict between gravity and rigidity—and ending with the
          consideration of tragedy, which presents to us at the highest
          grades of the objectification of will this very conflict with
          itself in terrible magnitude and distinctness; we find that there
          is still another fine art which has been excluded from our
          consideration, and had to be excluded, for in the systematic
          connection of our exposition there was no fitting place for it—I
          mean <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">music</span></em>. It stands alone, quite cut
          off from all the other arts. In it we do not recognise the copy or
          repetition of any Idea of existence in the world. Yet it is such a
          great and exceedingly noble art, its effect on the inmost nature of
          man is so powerful, and it is so entirely and deeply understood by
          him in his inmost consciousness as a perfectly universal language,
          the distinctness of which surpasses even that of the perceptible
          world itself, that we certainly have more to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page331">[pg 331]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg331"></a> look for in it than an <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">exercitum arithmeticæ occultum nescientis se
          numerare animi</span></span>,<a href="#note_62" id="noteref_62" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">62</span></span></a> which
          Leibnitz called it. Yet he was perfectly right, as he considered
          only its immediate external significance, its form. But if it were
          nothing more, the satisfaction which it affords would be like that
          which we feel when a sum in arithmetic comes out right, and could
          not be that intense pleasure with which we see the deepest recesses
          of our nature find utterance. From our standpoint, therefore, at
          which the æsthetic effect is the criterion, we must attribute to
          music a far more serious and deep significance, connected with the
          inmost nature of the world and our own self, and in reference to
          which the arithmetical proportions, to which it may be reduced, are
          related, not as the thing signified, but merely as the sign. That
          in some sense music must be related to the world as the
          representation to the thing represented, as the copy to the
          original, we may conclude from the analogy of the other arts, all
          of which possess this character, and affect us on the whole in the
          same way as it does, only that the effect of music is stronger,
          quicker, more necessary and infallible. Further, its representative
          relation to the world must be very deep, absolutely true, and
          strikingly accurate, because it is instantly understood by every
          one, and has the appearance of a certain infallibility, because its
          form may be reduced to perfectly definite rules expressed in
          numbers, from which it cannot free itself without entirely ceasing
          to be music. Yet the point of comparison between music and the
          world, the respect in which it stands to the world in the relation
          of a copy or repetition, is very obscure. Men have practised music
          in all ages without being able to account for this; content to
          understand it directly, they renounce all claim to an abstract
          conception of this direct understanding itself.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I gave my mind
          entirely up to the impression of music <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page332">[pg 332]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg332"></a> in all its forms, and then returned to
          reflection and the system of thought expressed in the present work,
          and thus I arrived at an explanation of the inner nature of music
          and of the nature of its imitative relation to the world—which from
          analogy had necessarily to be presupposed—an explanation which is
          quite sufficient for myself, and satisfactory to my investigation,
          and which will doubtless be equally evident to any one who has
          followed me thus far and has agreed with my view of the world. Yet
          I recognise the fact that it is essentially impossible to prove
          this explanation, for it assumes and establishes a relation of
          music, as idea, to that which from its nature can never be idea,
          and music will have to be regarded as the copy of an original which
          can never itself be directly presented as idea. I can therefore do
          no more than state here, at the conclusion of this third book,
          which has been principally devoted to the consideration of the
          arts, the explanation of the marvellous art of music which
          satisfies myself, and I must leave the acceptance or denial of my
          view to the effect produced upon each of my readers both by music
          itself and by the whole system of thought communicated in this
          work. Moreover, I regard it as necessary, in order to be able to
          assent with full conviction to the exposition of the significance
          of music I am about to give, that one should often listen to music
          with constant reflection upon my theory concerning it, and for this
          again it is necessary to be very familiar with the whole of my
          system of thought.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The (Platonic)
          Ideas are the adequate objectification of will. To excite or
          suggest the knowledge of these by means of the representation of
          particular things (for works of art themselves are always
          representations of particular things) is the end of all the other
          arts, which can only be attained by a corresponding change in the
          knowing subject. Thus all these arts objectify the will indirectly
          only by means of the Ideas; and since our world is nothing but the
          manifestation of the Ideas in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page333">[pg 333]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg333"></a> multiplicity, though their entrance into the
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium individuationis</span></span> (the
          form of the knowledge possible for the individual as such), music
          also, since it passes over the Ideas, is entirely independent of
          the phenomenal world, ignores it altogether, could to a certain
          extent exist if there was no world at all, which cannot be said of
          the other arts. Music is as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">direct</span></em> an objectification and copy
          of the whole <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em> as the world itself, nay,
          even as the Ideas, whose multiplied manifestation constitutes the
          world of individual things. Music is thus by no means like the
          other arts, the copy of the Ideas, but the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">copy of the will
          itself</span></em>, whose objectivity the Ideas are. This is why
          the effect of music is so much more powerful and penetrating than
          that of the other arts, for they speak only of shadows, but it
          speaks of the thing itself. Since, however, it is the same will
          which objectifies itself both in the Ideas and in music, though in
          quite different ways, there must be, not indeed a direct likeness,
          but yet a parallel, an analogy, between music and the Ideas whose
          manifestation in multiplicity and incompleteness is the visible
          world. The establishing of this analogy will facilitate, as an
          illustration, the understanding of this exposition, which is so
          difficult on account of the obscurity of the subject.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I recognise in
          the deepest tones of harmony, in the bass, the lowest grades of the
          objectification of will, unorganised nature, the mass of the
          planet. It is well known that all the high notes which are easily
          sounded, and die away more quickly, are produced by the vibration
          in their vicinity of the deep bass-notes. When, also, the low notes
          sound, the high notes always sound faintly, and it is a law of
          harmony that only those high notes may accompany a bass-note which
          actually already sound along with it of themselves (its <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">sons harmoniques</span></span>) on account of
          its vibration. This is analogous to the fact that the whole of the
          bodies and organisations of nature must be regarded as having come
          into existence through gradual development out of the mass of the
          planet; this <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page334">[pg
          334]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg334"></a>
          is both their supporter and their source, and the same relation
          subsists between the high notes and the bass. There is a limit of
          depth, below which no sound is audible. This corresponds to the
          fact that no matter can be perceived without form and quality,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, without the manifestation
          of a force which cannot be further explained, in which an Idea
          expresses itself, and, more generally, that no matter can be
          entirely without will. Thus, as a certain pitch is inseparable from
          the note as such, so a certain grade of the manifestation of will
          is inseparable from matter. Bass is thus, for us, in harmony what
          unorganised nature, the crudest mass, upon which all rests, and
          from which everything originates and develops, is in the world.
          Now, further, in the whole of the complemental parts which make up
          the harmony between the bass and the leading voice singing the
          melody, I recognise the whole gradation of the Ideas in which the
          will objectifies itself. Those nearer to the bass are the lower of
          these grades, the still unorganised, but yet manifold phenomenal
          things; the higher represent to me the world of plants and beasts.
          The definite intervals of the scale are parallel to the definite
          grades of the objectification of will, the definite species in
          nature. The departure from the arithmetical correctness of the
          intervals, through some temperament, or produced by the key
          selected, is analogous to the departure of the individual from the
          type of the species. Indeed, even the impure discords, which give
          no definite interval, may be compared to the monstrous abortions
          produced by beasts of two species, or by man and beast. But to all
          these bass and complemental parts which make up the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">harmony</span></em>
          there is wanting that connected progress which belongs only to the
          high voice singing the melody, and it alone moves quickly and
          lightly in modulations and runs, while all these others have only a
          slower movement without a connection in each part for itself. The
          deep bass moves most slowly, the representative of the crudest
          mass. Its <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page335">[pg
          335]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg335"></a>
          rising and falling occurs only by large intervals, in thirds,
          fourths, fifths, never by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> tone, unless it is a base
          inverted by double counterpoint. This slow movement is also
          physically essential to it; a quick run or shake in the low notes
          cannot even be imagined. The higher complemental parts, which are
          parallel to animal life, move more quickly, but yet without
          melodious connection and significant progress. The disconnected
          course of all the complemental parts, and their regulation by
          definite laws, is analogous to the fact that in the whole
          irrational world, from the crystal to the most perfect animal, no
          being has a connected consciousness of its own which would make its
          life into a significant whole, and none experiences a succession of
          mental developments, none perfects itself by culture, but
          everything exists always in the same way according to its kind,
          determined by fixed law. Lastly, in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">melody</span></em>,
          in the high, singing, principal voice leading the whole and
          progressing with unrestrained freedom, in the unbroken significant
          connection of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> thought from beginning to end
          representing a whole, I recognise the highest grade of the
          objectification of will, the intellectual life and effort of man.
          As he alone, because endowed with reason, constantly looks before
          and after on the path of his actual life and its innumerable
          possibilities, and so achieves a course of life which is
          intellectual, and therefore connected as a whole; corresponding to
          this, I say, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">melody</span></em> has significant intentional
          connection from beginning to end. It records, therefore, the
          history of the intellectually enlightened will. This will expresses
          itself in the actual world as the series of its deeds; but melody
          says more, it records the most secret history of this
          intellectually-enlightened will, pictures every excitement, every
          effort, every movement of it, all that which the reason collects
          under the wide and negative concept of feeling, and which it cannot
          apprehend further through its abstract concepts. Therefore it has
          always been said that music <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page336">[pg 336]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg336"></a> is the language of feeling and of passion, as
          words are the language of reason. Plato explains it as ἡ των μελων
          κινησις μεμιμημενη, εν τοις παθημασιν ὁταν ψυχη γινηται
          (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">melodiarum motus, animi affectus
          imitans</span></span>), De Leg. vii.; and also Aristotle says: δια
          τι οἱ ρυθμοι και τα μελη, φωνη ουσα, ηθεσιν εοικε (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">cur numeri musici et modi, qui voces sunt,
          moribus similes sese exhibent?</span></span>): Probl. c. 19.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now the nature
          of man consists in this, that his will strives, is satisfied and
          strives anew, and so on for ever. Indeed, his happiness and
          well-being consist simply in the quick transition from wish to
          satisfaction, and from satisfaction to a new wish. For the absence
          of satisfaction is suffering, the empty longing for a new wish,
          languor, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ennui</span></em>. And corresponding to this
          the nature of melody is a constant digression and deviation from
          the key-note in a thousand ways, not only to the harmonious
          intervals to the third and dominant, but to every tone, to the
          dissonant sevenths and to the superfluous degrees; yet there always
          follows a constant return to the key-note. In all these deviations
          melody expresses the multifarious efforts of will, but always its
          satisfaction also by the final return to an harmonious interval,
          and still more, to the key-note. The composition of melody, the
          disclosure in it of all the deepest secrets of human willing and
          feeling, is the work of genius, whose action, which is more
          apparent here than anywhere else, lies far from all reflection and
          conscious intention, and may be called an inspiration. The
          conception is here, as everywhere in art, unfruitful. The composer
          reveals the inner nature of the world, and expresses the deepest
          wisdom in a language which his reason does not understand; as a
          person under the influence of mesmerism tells things of which he
          has no conception when he awakes. Therefore in the composer, more
          than in any other artist, the man is entirely separated and
          distinct from the artist. Even in the explanation of this wonderful
          art, the concept shows its poverty <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page337">[pg 337]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg337"></a> and limitation. I shall try, however, to
          complete our analogy. As quick transition from wish to
          satisfaction, and from satisfaction to a new wish, is happiness and
          well-being, so quick melodies without great deviations are
          cheerful; slow melodies, striking painful discords, and only
          winding back through many bars to the keynote are, as analogous to
          the delayed and hardly won satisfaction, sad. The delay of the new
          excitement of will, languor, could have no other expression than
          the sustained keynote, the effect of which would soon be
          unbearable; very monotonous and unmeaning melodies approach this
          effect. The short intelligible subjects of quick dance-music seem
          to speak only of easily attained common pleasure. On the other
          hand, the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="it"><span style="font-style: italic">Allegro
          maestoso</span></span>, in elaborate movements, long passages, and
          wide deviations, signifies a greater, nobler effort towards a more
          distant end, and its final attainment. The <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="it"><span style="font-style: italic">Adagio</span></span> speaks of the pain of a
          great and noble effort which despises all trifling happiness. But
          how wonderful is the effect of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">minor</span></em>
          and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">major</span></em>! How astounding that the
          change of half a tone, the entrance of a minor third instead of a
          major, at once and inevitably forces upon us an anxious painful
          feeling, from which again we are just as instantaneously delivered
          by the major. The <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="it"><span style="font-style: italic">Adagio</span></span>
          lengthens in the minor the expression of the keenest pain, and
          becomes even a convulsive wail. Dance-music in the minor seems to
          indicate the failure of that trifling happiness which we ought
          rather to despise, seems to speak of the attainment of a lower end
          with toil and trouble. The inexhaustibleness of possible melodies
          corresponds to the inexhaustibleness of Nature in difference of
          individuals, physiognomies, and courses of life. The transition
          from one key to an entirely different one, since it altogether
          breaks the connection with what went before, is like death, for the
          individual ends in it; but the will which appeared in this
          individual lives after him as before him, appearing in other
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page338">[pg 338]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg338"></a> individuals, whose
          consciousness, however, has no connection with his.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But it must
          never be forgotten, in the investigation of all these analogies I
          have pointed out, that music has no direct, but merely an indirect
          relation to them, for it never expresses the phenomenon, but only
          the inner nature, the in-itself of all phenomena, the will itself.
          It does not therefore express this or that particular and definite
          joy, this or that sorrow, or pain, or horror, or delight, or
          merriment, or peace of mind; but joy, sorrow, pain, horror,
          delight, merriment, peace of mind <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">themselves</span></em>, to a certain extent in
          the abstract, their essential nature, without accessories, and
          therefore without their motives. Yet we completely understand them
          in this extracted quintessence. Hence it arises that our
          imagination is so easily excited by music, and now seeks to give
          form to that invisible yet actively moved spirit-world which speaks
          to us directly, and clothe it with flesh and blood, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          to embody it in an analogous example. This is the origin of the
          song with words, and finally of the opera, the text of which should
          therefore never forsake that subordinate position in order to make
          itself the chief thing and the music a mere means of expressing it,
          which is a great misconception and a piece of utter perversity; for
          music always expresses only the quintessence of life and its
          events, never these themselves, and therefore their differences do
          not always affect it. It is precisely this universality, which
          belongs exclusively to it, together with the greatest
          determinateness, that gives music the high worth which it has as
          the panacea for all our woes. Thus, if music is too closely united
          to the words, and tries to form itself according to the events, it
          is striving to speak a language which is not its own. No one has
          kept so free from this mistake as Rossini; therefore his music
          speaks <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">its own language</span></em> so distinctly and
          purely that it requires no words, and produces its full effect when
          rendered by instruments alone.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page339">[pg 339]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg339"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">According to all
          this, we may regard the phenomenal world, or nature, and music as
          two different expressions of the same thing, which is therefore
          itself the only medium of their analogy, so that a knowledge of it
          is demanded in order to understand that analogy. Music, therefore,
          if regarded as an expression of the world, is in the highest degree
          a universal language, which is related indeed to the universality
          of concepts, much as they are related to the particular things. Its
          universality, however, is by no means that empty universality of
          abstraction, but quite of a different kind, and is united with
          thorough and distinct definiteness. In this respect it resembles
          geometrical figures and numbers, which are the universal forms of
          all possible objects of experience and applicable to them all
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span>, and yet are not
          abstract but perceptible and thoroughly determined. All possible
          efforts, excitements, and manifestations of will, all that goes on
          in the heart of man and that reason includes in the wide, negative
          concept of feeling, may be expressed by the infinite number of
          possible melodies, but always in the universal, in the mere form,
          without the material, always according to the thing-in-itself, not
          the phenomenon, the inmost soul, as it were, of the phenomenon,
          without the body. This deep relation which music has to the true
          nature of all things also explains the fact that suitable music
          played to any scene, action, event, or surrounding seems to
          disclose to us its most secret meaning, and appears as the most
          accurate and distinct commentary upon it. This is so truly the
          case, that whoever gives himself up entirely to the impression of a
          symphony, seems to see all the possible events of life and the
          world take place in himself, yet if he reflects, he can find no
          likeness between the music and the things that passed before his
          mind. For, as we have said, music is distinguished from all the
          other arts by the fact that it is not a copy of the phenomenon, or,
          more accurately, the adequate objectivity of will, but is the
          direct copy of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page340">[pg
          340]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg340"></a>
          will itself, and therefore exhibits itself as the metaphysical to
          everything physical in the world, and as the thing-in-itself to
          every phenomenon. We might, therefore, just as well call the world
          embodied music as embodied will; and this is the reason why music
          makes every picture, and indeed every scene of real life and of the
          world, at once appear with higher significance, certainly all the
          more in proportion as its melody is analogous to the inner spirit
          of the given phenomenon. It rests upon this that we are able to set
          a poem to music as a song, or a perceptible representation as a
          pantomime, or both as an opera. Such particular pictures of human
          life, set to the universal language of music, are never bound to it
          or correspond to it with stringent necessity; but they stand to it
          only in the relation of an example chosen at will to a general
          concept. In the determinateness of the real, they represent that
          which music expresses in the universality of mere form. For
          melodies are to a certain extent, like general concepts, an
          abstraction from the actual. This actual world, then, the world of
          particular things, affords the object of perception, the special
          and individual, the particular case, both to the universality of
          the concepts and to the universality of the melodies. But these two
          universalities are in a certain respect opposed to each other; for
          the concepts contain particulars only as the first forms abstracted
          from perception, as it were, the separated shell of things; thus
          they are, strictly speaking, <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">abstracta</span></span>; music, on the other
          hand, gives the inmost kernel which precedes all forms, or the
          heart of things. This relation may be very well expressed in the
          language of the schoolmen by saying the concepts are the
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">universalia post rem</span></span>, but music
          gives the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">universalia ante
          rem</span></span>, and the real world the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">universalia in re</span></span>. To the
          universal significance of a melody to which a poem has been set, it
          is quite possible to set other equally arbitrarily selected
          examples of the universal expressed in this poem corresponding to
          the significance of the melody in the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page341">[pg 341]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg341"></a> same degree. This is why the same composition
          is suitable to many verses; and this is also what makes the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">vaudeville</span></em> possible. But that in
          general a relation is possible between a composition and a
          perceptible representation rests, as we have said, upon the fact
          that both are simply different expressions of the same inner being
          of the world. When now, in the particular case, such a relation is
          actually given, that is to say, when the composer has been able to
          express in the universal language of music the emotions of will
          which constitute the heart of an event, then the melody of the
          song, the music of the opera, is expressive. But the analogy
          discovered by the composer between the two must have proceeded from
          the direct knowledge of the nature of the world unknown to his
          reason, and must not be an imitation produced with conscious
          intention by means of conceptions, otherwise the music does not
          express the inner nature of the will itself, but merely gives an
          inadequate imitation of its phenomenon. All specially imitative
          music does this; for example, <span class="tei tei-q">“The
          Seasons,”</span> by Haydn; also many passages of his <span class="tei tei-q">“Creation,”</span> in which phenomena of the external
          world are directly imitated; also all battle-pieces. Such music is
          entirely to be rejected.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The unutterable
          depth of all music by virtue of which it floats through our
          consciousness as the vision of a paradise firmly believed in yet
          ever distant from us, and by which also it is so fully understood
          and yet so inexplicable, rests on the fact that it restores to us
          all the emotions of our inmost nature, but entirely without reality
          and far removed from their pain. So also the seriousness which is
          essential to it, which excludes the absurd from its direct and
          peculiar province, is to be explained by the fact that its object
          is not the idea, with reference to which alone deception and
          absurdity are possible; but its object is directly the will, and
          this is essentially the most serious of all things, for it is that
          on which all depends. How rich in content and full of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page342">[pg 342]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg342"></a> significance the language of music is,
          we see from the repetitions, as well as the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="it"><span style="font-style: italic">Da
          capo</span></span>, the like of which would be unbearable in works
          composed in a language of words, but in music are very appropriate
          and beneficial, for, in order to comprehend it fully, we must hear
          it twice.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the whole of
          this exposition of music I have been trying to bring out clearly
          that it expresses in a perfectly universal language, in a
          homogeneous material, mere tones, and with the greatest
          determinateness and truth, the inner nature, the in-itself of the
          world, which we think under the concept of will, because will is
          its most distinct manifestation. Further, according to my view and
          contention, philosophy is nothing but a complete and accurate
          repetition or expression of the nature of the world in very general
          concepts, for only in such is it possible to get a view of that
          whole nature which will everywhere be adequate and applicable.
          Thus, whoever has followed me and entered into my mode of thought,
          will not think it so very paradoxical if I say, that supposing it
          were possible to give a perfectly accurate, complete explanation of
          music, extending even to particulars, that is to say, a detailed
          repetition in concepts of what it expresses, this would also be a
          sufficient repetition and explanation of the world in concepts, or
          at least entirely parallel to such an explanation, and thus it
          would be the true philosophy. Consequently the saying of Leibnitz
          quoted above, which is quite accurate from a lower standpoint, may
          be parodied in the following way to suit our higher view of music:
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Musica est exercitium metaphysices occultum
          nescientis se philosophari animi</span></span>; for <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">scire</span></span>, to know, always means to
          have fixed in abstract concepts. But further, on account of the
          truth of the saying of Leibnitz, which is confirmed in various
          ways, music, regarded apart from its æsthetic or inner
          significance, and looked at merely externally and purely
          empirically, is simply the means of comprehending directly and in
          the concrete <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page343">[pg
          343]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg343"></a>
          large numbers and complex relations of numbers, which otherwise we
          could only know indirectly by fixing them in concepts. Therefore by
          the union of these two very different but correct views of music we
          may arrive at a conception of the possibility of a philosophy of
          number, such as that of Pythagoras and of the Chinese in Y-King,
          and then interpret in this sense the saying of the Pythagoreans
          which Sextus Empiricus quotes (adv. Math., L. vii.): τῳ αριθμῳ δε
          τα παντ᾽ επεοικεν (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">numero cuncta
          assimilantur</span></span>). And if, finally, we apply this view to
          the interpretation of harmony and melody given above, we shall find
          that a mere moral philosophy without an explanation of Nature, such
          as Socrates wanted to introduce, is precisely analogous to a mere
          melody without harmony, which Rousseau exclusively desired; and, in
          opposition to this mere physics and metaphysics without ethics,
          will correspond to mere harmony without melody. Allow me to add to
          these cursory observations a few more remarks concerning the
          analogy of music with the phenomenal world. We found in the second
          book that the highest grade of the objectification of will, man,
          could not appear alone and isolated, but presupposed the grades
          below him, as these again presupposed the grades lower still. In
          the same way music, which directly objectifies the will, just as
          the world does, is complete only in full harmony. In order to
          achieve its full effect, the high leading voice of the melody
          requires the accompaniment of all the other voices, even to the
          lowest bass, which is to be regarded as the origin of all. The
          melody itself enters as an integral part into the harmony, as the
          harmony enters into it, and only thus, in the full harmonious
          whole, music expresses what it aims at expressing. Thus also the
          one will outside of time finds its full objectification only in the
          complete union of all the steps which reveal its nature in the
          innumerable ascending grades of distinctness. The following analogy
          is also very remarkable. We have seen in the preceding book that
          notwithstanding <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page344">[pg
          344]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg344"></a>
          the self-adaptation of all the phenomena of will to each other as
          regards their species, which constitutes their teleological aspect,
          there yet remains an unceasing conflict between those phenomena as
          individuals, which is visible at every grade, and makes the world a
          constant battle-field of all those manifestations of one and the
          same will, whose inner contradiction with itself becomes visible
          through it. In music also there is something corresponding to this.
          A complete, pure, harmonious system of tones is not only physically
          but arithmetically impossible. The numbers themselves by which the
          tones are expressed have inextricable irrationality. There is no
          scale in which, when it is counted, every fifth will be related to
          the keynote as 2 to 3, every major third as 4 to 5, every minor
          third as 5 to 6, and so on. For if they are correctly related to
          the keynote, they can no longer be so to each other; because, for
          example, the fifth must be the minor third to the third, &amp;c.
          For the notes of the scale may be compared to actors who must play
          now one part, now another. Therefore a perfectly accurate system of
          music cannot even be thought, far less worked out; and on this
          account all possible music deviates from perfect purity; it can
          only conceal the discords essential to it by dividing them among
          all the notes, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, by temperament. On this
          see Chladni's <span class="tei tei-q">“Akustik,”</span> § 30, and
          his <span class="tei tei-q">“Kurze Uebersicht der Schall- und
          Klanglehre.”</span><a href="#note_63" id="noteref_63" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">63</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I might still
          have something to say about the way in which music is perceived,
          namely, in and through time alone, with absolute exclusion of
          space, and also apart from the influence of the knowledge of
          causality, thus without understanding; for the tones make the
          æsthetic impression as effect, and without obliging us to go back
          to their causes, as in the case of perception. I do not wish,
          however, to lengthen this discussion, as I have perhaps already
          gone too much into detail with regard to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page345">[pg 345]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg345"></a> some things in this Third Book, or have dwelt
          too much on particulars. But my aim made it necessary, and it will
          be the less disapproved if the importance and high worth of art,
          which is seldom sufficiently recognised, be kept in mind. For if,
          according to our view, the whole visible world is just the
          objectification, the mirror, of the will, conducting it to
          knowledge of itself, and, indeed, as we shall soon see, to the
          possibility of its deliverance; and if, at the same time, the world
          as idea, if we regard it in isolation, and, freeing ourselves from
          all volition, allow it alone to take possession of our
          consciousness, is the most joy-giving and the only innocent side of
          life; we must regard art as the higher ascent, the more complete
          development of all this, for it achieves essentially just what is
          achieved by the visible world itself, only with greater
          concentration, more perfectly, with intention and intelligence, and
          therefore may be called, in the full significance of the word, the
          flower of life. If the whole world as idea is only the visibility
          of will, the work of art is to render this visibility more
          distinct. It is the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">camera
          obscura</span></span> which shows the objects more purely, and
          enables us to survey them and comprehend them better. It is the
          play within the play, the stage upon the stage in <span class="tei tei-q">“Hamlet.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The pleasure we
          receive from all beauty, the consolation which art affords, the
          enthusiasm of the artist, which enables him to forget the cares of
          life,—the latter an advantage of the man of genius over other men,
          which alone repays him for the suffering that increases in
          proportion to the clearness of consciousness, and for the desert
          loneliness among men of a different race,—all this rests on the
          fact that the in-itself of life, the will, existence itself, is, as
          we shall see farther on, a constant sorrow, partly miserable,
          partly terrible; while, on the contrary, as idea alone, purely
          contemplated, or copied by art, free from pain, it presents to us a
          drama full of significance. This purely knowable side of the world,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page346">[pg 346]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg346"></a> and the copy of it
          in any art, is the element of the artist. He is chained to the
          contemplation of the play, the objectification of will; he remains
          beside it, does not get tired of contemplating it and representing
          it in copies; and meanwhile he bears himself the cost of the
          production of that play, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, he himself is the will
          which objectifies itself, and remains in constant suffering. That
          pure, true, and deep knowledge of the inner nature of the world
          becomes now for him an end in itself: he stops there. Therefore it
          does not become to him a quieter of the will, as, we shall see in
          the next book, it does in the case of the saint who has attained to
          resignation; it does not deliver him for ever from life, but only
          at moments, and is therefore not for him a path out of life, but
          only an occasional consolation in it, till his power, increased by
          this contemplation and at last tired of the play, lays hold on the
          real. The St. Cecilia of Raphael may be regarded as a
          representation of this transition. To the real, then, we now turn
          in the following book.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 53. The last
          part of our work presents itself as the most serious, for it
          relates to the action of men, the matter which concerns every one
          directly and can be foreign or indifferent to none. It is indeed so
          characteristic of the nature of man to relate everything else to
          action, that in every systematic investigation he will always treat
          the part that has to do with action as the result or outcome of the
          whole work, so far, at least, as it interests him, and will
          therefore give his most serious attention to this part, even if to
          no other. In this respect the following part of our work would, in
          ordinary language, be called practical philosophy, in opposition to
          the theoretical, which has occupied us hitherto. But, in my
          opinion, all philosophy is theoretical, because it is essential to
          it that it should retain a purely contemplative attitude, and
          should investigate, not prescribe. To become, on the contrary,
          practical, to guide conduct, to transform character, are old
          claims, which with fuller insight it ought finally to give up. For
          here, where the worth or worthlessness of an existence, where
          salvation or damnation are in question, the dead conceptions of
          philosophy do not decide the matter, but the inmost nature of man
          himself, the Dæmon that guides him and that has not chosen him, but
          been chosen by him, as Plato would say; his intelligible character,
          as Kant expresses himself. Virtue cannot be taught any more than
          genius; indeed, for it the concept is just as unfruitful as it is
          in art, and in both cases can only be used as <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page350">[pg 350]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg350"></a> an instrument. It would, therefore, be
          just as absurd to expect that our moral systems and ethics will
          produce virtuous, noble, and holy men, as that our æsthetics will
          produce poets, painters, and musicians.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Philosophy can
          never do more than interpret and explain what is given. It can only
          bring to distinct abstract knowledge of the reason the nature of
          the world which in the concrete, that is, as feeling, expresses
          itself comprehensibly to every one. This, however, it does in every
          possible reference and from every point of view. Now, as this
          attempt has been made from other points of view in the three
          preceding books with the generality that is proper to philosophy,
          in this book the action of men will be considered in the same way;
          and this side of the world might, indeed, be considered the most
          important of all, not only subjectively, as I remarked above, but
          also objectively. In considering it I shall faithfully adhere to
          the method I have hitherto followed, and shall support myself by
          presupposing all that has already been advanced. There is, indeed,
          just one thought which forms the content of this whole work. I have
          endeavoured to work it out in all other spheres, and I shall now do
          so with regard to human action. I shall then have done all that is
          in my power to communicate it as fully as possible.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The given point
          of view, and the method of treatment announced, are themselves
          sufficient to indicate that in this ethical book no precepts, no
          doctrine of duty must be looked for; still less will a general
          moral principle be given, an universal receipt, as it were, for the
          production of all the virtues. Neither shall we talk of an
          <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">absolute ought</span></em>,”</span> for this
          contains a contradiction, as is explained in the Appendix; nor yet
          of a <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">law of freedom</span></em>,”</span> which is
          in the same position. In general, we shall not speak at all of
          <span class="tei tei-q">“ought,”</span> for this is how one speaks
          to children and to nations still in their childhood, but not to
          those who have appropriated all the culture of a full-grown
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page351">[pg 351]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg351"></a> age. It is a
          palpable contradiction to call the will free, and yet to prescribe
          laws for it according to which it ought to will. <span class="tei tei-q">“Ought to will!”</span>—wooden iron! But it follows
          from the point of view of our system that the will is not only
          free, but almighty. From it proceeds not only its action, but also
          its world; and as the will is, so does its action and its world
          become. Both are the self-knowledge of the will and nothing more.
          The will determines itself, and at the same time both its action
          and its world; for besides it there is nothing, and these are the
          will itself. Only thus is the will truly autonomous, and from every
          other point of view it is heteronomous. Our philosophical
          endeavours can only extend to exhibiting and explaining the action
          of men in its inner nature and content, the various and even
          opposite maxims, whose living expression it is. This we shall do in
          connection with the preceding portion of our work, and in precisely
          the same way as we have hitherto explained the other phenomena of
          the world, and have sought to bring their inmost nature to distinct
          abstract knowledge. Our philosophy will maintain the same
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">immanency</span></em> in the case of action,
          as in all that we have hitherto considered. Notwithstanding Kant's
          great doctrine, it will not attempt to use the forms of the
          phenomenon, the universal expression of which is the principle of
          sufficient reason, as a leaping-pole to jump over the phenomenon
          itself, which alone gives meaning to these forms, and land in the
          boundless sphere of empty fictions. But this actual world of
          experience, in which we are, and which is in us, remains both the
          material and the limits of our consideration: a world which is so
          rich in content that even the most searching investigation of which
          the human mind is capable could not exhaust it. Since then the real
          world of experience will never fail to afford material and reality
          to our ethical investigations, any more than to those we have
          already conducted, nothing will be less needful than to take refuge
          in negative conceptions <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page352">[pg
          352]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg352"></a>
          void of content, and then somehow or other make even ourselves
          believe that we are saying something when we speak with lifted
          eyebrows of <span class="tei tei-q">“absolutes,”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“infinites,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“supersensibles,”</span> and whatever other mere
          negations of this sort there may be (ουδεν εστι, η το της στερησεως
          ονομα, μετα αμυδρας επινοιας—<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">nihil est, nisi negationis nomen, cum obscura
          notione</span></span>.—Jul. or. 5), instead of which it would be
          shorter to say at once cloud-cuckoo-town (νεφελοκοκκυγια): we shall
          not require to serve up covered empty dishes of this kind. Finally,
          we shall not in this book, any more than in those which have
          preceded it, narrate histories and give them out as philosophy. For
          we are of opinion that whoever supposes that the inner nature of
          the world can in any way, however plausibly disguised, be
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">historically</span></em> comprehended, is
          infinitely far from a philosophical knowledge of the world. Yet
          this is what is supposed whenever a <span class="tei tei-q">“becoming,”</span> or a <span class="tei tei-q">“having
          become,”</span> or an <span class="tei tei-q">“about to
          become”</span> enters into a theory of the nature of the world,
          whenever an earlier or a later has the least place in it; and in
          this way a beginning and an end of the world, and the path it
          pursues between them, is, either openly or disguisedly, both sought
          for and found, and the individual who philosophises even recognises
          his own position on that path. Such <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">historical
          philosophising</span></em> in most cases produces a cosmogony which
          admits of many varieties, or else a system of emanations, a
          doctrine of successive disengagements from one being; or, finally,
          driven in despair from fruitless efforts upon these paths to the
          last path of all, it takes refuge in the converse doctrine of a
          constant becoming, springing up, arising, coming to light out of
          darkness, out of the hidden ground source or groundlessness, or
          whatever other nonsense of this sort there may be, which is most
          shortly disposed of with the remark that at the present moment a
          whole eternity, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, an endless time, has
          already passed, so that everything that can or ought to become must
          have already done so. For all such historical philosophy, whatever
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page353">[pg 353]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg353"></a> airs it may give
          itself, regards <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">time</span></em> just as if Kant had never
          lived, as a quality of the thing-in-itself, and thus stops at that
          which Kant calls the phenomenon in opposition to the
          thing-in-itself; which Plato calls the becoming and never being, in
          opposition to the being and never becoming; and which, finally, is
          called in the Indian philosophy the web of Mâya. It is just the
          knowledge which belongs to the principle of sufficient reason, with
          which no one can penetrate to the inner nature of things, but
          endlessly pursues phenomena, moving without end or aim, like a
          squirrel in its wheel, till, tired out at last, he stops at some
          point or other arbitrarily chosen, and now desires to extort
          respect for it from others also. The genuine philosophical
          consideration of the world, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the consideration that
          affords us a knowledge of its inner nature, and so leads us beyond
          the phenomenon, is precisely that method which does not concern
          itself with the whence, the whither, and the why of the world, but
          always and everywhere demands only the what; the method which
          considers things not according to any relation, not as becoming and
          passing away, in short, not according to one of the four forms of
          the principle of sufficient reason; but, on the contrary, just that
          which remains when all that belongs to the form of knowledge proper
          to that principle has been abstracted, the inner nature of the
          world, which always appears unchanged in all the relations, but is
          itself never subject to them, and has the Ideas of the world as its
          object or material. From such knowledge as this proceeds
          philosophy, like art, and also, as we shall see in this book, that
          disposition of mind which alone leads to true holiness and to
          deliverance from the world.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 54. The first
          three books will, it is hoped, have conveyed the distinct and
          certain knowledge that the world as idea is the complete mirror of
          the will, in which it knows itself in ascending grades of
          distinctness <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page354">[pg
          354]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg354"></a>
          and completeness, the highest of which is man, whose nature,
          however, receives its complete expression only through the whole
          connected series of his actions. The self-conscious connection of
          these actions is made possible by reason, which enables a man
          constantly to survey the whole in the abstract.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The will, which,
          considered purely in itself, is without knowledge, and is merely a
          blind incessant impulse, as we see it appear in unorganised and
          vegetable nature and their laws, and also in the vegetative part of
          our own life, receives through the addition of the world as idea,
          which is developed in subjection to it, the knowledge of its own
          willing and of what it is that it wills. And this is nothing else
          than the world as idea, life, precisely as it exists. Therefore we
          called the phenomenal world the mirror of the will, its
          objectivity. And since what the will wills is always life, just
          because life is nothing but the representation of that willing for
          the idea, it is all one and a mere pleonism if, instead of simply
          saying <span class="tei tei-q">“the will,”</span> we say
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the will to live.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Will is the
          thing-in-itself, the inner content, the essence of the world. Life,
          the visible world, the phenomenon, is only the mirror of the will.
          Therefore life accompanies the will as inseparably as the shadow
          accompanies the body; and if will exists, so will life, the world,
          exist. Life is, therefore, assured to the will to live; and so long
          as we are filled with the will to live we need have no fear for our
          existence, even in the presence of death. It is true we see the
          individual come into being and pass away; but the individual is
          only phenomenal, exists only for the knowledge which is bound to
          the principle of sufficient reason, to the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principio individuationis</span></span>.
          Certainly, for this kind of knowledge, the individual receives his
          life as a gift, rises out of nothing, then suffers the loss of this
          gift through death, and returns again to nothing. But we desire to
          consider life <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page355">[pg
          355]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg355"></a>
          philosophically, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, according to its Ideas,
          and in this sphere we shall find that neither the will, the
          thing-in-itself in all phenomena, nor the subject of knowing, that
          which perceives all phenomena, is affected at all by birth or by
          death. Birth and death belong merely to the phenomenon of will,
          thus to life; and it is essential to this to exhibit itself in
          individuals which come into being and pass away, as fleeting
          phenomena appearing in the form of time—phenomena of that which in
          itself knows no time, but must exhibit itself precisely in the way
          we have said, in order to objectify its peculiar nature. Birth and
          death belong in like manner to life, and hold the balance as
          reciprocal conditions of each other, or, if one likes the
          expression, as poles of the whole phenomenon of life. The wisest of
          all mythologies, the Indian, expresses this by giving to the very
          god that symbolises destruction, death (as Brahma, the most sinful
          and the lowest god of the Trimurti, symbolises generation, coming
          into being, and Vishnu maintaining or preserving), by giving, I
          say, to Siva as an attribute not only the necklace of skulls, but
          also the lingam, the symbol of generation, which appears here as
          the counterpart of death, thus signifying that generation and death
          are essentially correlatives, which reciprocally neutralise and
          annul each other. It was precisely the same sentiment that led the
          Greeks and Romans to adorn their costly sarcophagi, just as we see
          them now, with feasts, dances, marriages, the chase, fights of wild
          beasts, bacchanalians, &amp;c.; thus with representations of the
          full ardour of life, which they place before us not only in such
          revels and sports, but also in sensual groups, and even go so far
          as to represent the sexual intercourse of satyrs and goats. Clearly
          the aim was to point in the most impressive manner away from the
          death of the mourned individual to the immortal life of nature, and
          thus to indicate, though without abstract knowledge, that the whole
          of nature is the phenomenon and also the fulfilment of the will to
          live. The form of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page356">[pg
          356]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg356"></a>
          this phenomenon is time, space, and causality, and by means of
          these individuation, which carries with it that the individual must
          come into being and pass away. But this no more affects the will to
          live, of whose manifestation the individual is, as it were, only a
          particular example or specimen, than the death of an individual
          injures the whole of nature. For it is not the individual, but only
          the species that Nature cares for, and for the preservation of
          which she so earnestly strives, providing for it with the utmost
          prodigality through the vast surplus of the seed and the great
          strength of the fructifying impulse. The individual, on the
          contrary, neither has nor can have any value for Nature, for her
          kingdom is infinite time and infinite space, and in these infinite
          multiplicity of possible individuals. Therefore she is always ready
          to let the individual fall, and hence it is not only exposed to
          destruction in a thousand ways by the most insignificant accident,
          but originally destined for it, and conducted towards it by Nature
          herself from the moment it has served its end of maintaining the
          species. Thus Nature naïvely expresses the great truth that only
          the Ideas, not the individuals, have, properly speaking, reality,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, are complete objectivity
          of the will. Now, since man is Nature itself, and indeed Nature at
          the highest grade of its self-consciousness, but Nature is only the
          objectified will to live, the man who has comprehended and retained
          this point of view may well console himself, when contemplating his
          own death and that of his friends, by turning his eyes to the
          immortal life of Nature, which he himself is. This is the
          significance of Siva with the lingam, and of those ancient
          sarcophagi with their pictures of glowing life, which say to the
          mourning beholder, <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Natura non
          contristatur</span></span>.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That generation
          and death are to be regarded as something belonging to life, and
          essential to this phenomenon of the will, arises also from the fact
          that they both exhibit themselves merely as higher powers of the
          expression <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page357">[pg
          357]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg357"></a>
          of that in which all the rest of life consists. This is through and
          through nothing else than the constant change of matter in the
          fixed permanence of form; and this is what constitutes the
          transitoriness of the individual and the permanence of the species.
          Constant nourishment and renewal differ from generation only in
          degree, and constant excretion differs only in degree from death.
          The first shows itself most simply and distinctly in the plant. The
          plant is throughout a constant recurrence of the same impulse of
          its simplest fibre, which groups itself into leaf and branch. It is
          a systematic aggregate of similar plants supporting each other,
          whose constant reproduction is its single impulse. It ascends to
          the full satisfaction of this tendency through the grades of its
          metamorphosis, finally to the blossom and fruit, that compendium of
          its existence and effort in which it now attains, by a short way,
          to that which is its single aim, and at a stroke produces a
          thousand-fold what, up till then, it effected only in the
          particular case—the repetition of itself. Its earlier growth and
          development stands in the same relation to its fruit as writing
          stands to printing. With the animal it is clearly quite the same.
          The process of nourishing is a constant reproduction; the process
          of reproduction is a higher power of nourishing. The pleasure which
          accompanies the act of procreation is a higher power of the
          agreeableness of the sense of life. On the other hand, excretion,
          the constant exhalation and throwing off of matter, is the same as
          that which, at a higher power, death, is the contrary of
          generation. And if here we are always content to retain the form
          without lamenting the discarded matter, we ought to bear ourselves
          in the same way if in death the same thing happens, in a higher
          degree and to the whole, as takes place daily and hourly in a
          partial manner in excretion: if we are indifferent to the one, we
          ought not to shrink from the other. Therefore, from this point of
          view, it appears just as perverse to desire <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page358">[pg 358]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg358"></a> the continuance of an individuality
          which will be replaced by other individuals as to desire the
          permanence of matter which will be replaced by other matter. It
          appears just as foolish to embalm the body as it would be carefully
          to preserve its excrement. As to the individual consciousness which
          is bound to the individual body, it is absolutely interrupted every
          day by sleep. Deep sleep is, while it lasts, in no way different
          from death, into which, in fact, it often passes continuously, as
          in the case of freezing to death. It differs only with regard to
          the future, the awaking. Death is a sleep in which individuality is
          forgotten; everything else wakes again, or rather never
          slept.<a href="#note_64" id="noteref_64" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">64</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Above all
          things, we must distinctly recognise that the form of the
          phenomenon of will, the form of life or reality, is really only the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">present</span></em>, not the future nor the
          past. The latter are only in the conception, exist only in the
          connection of knowledge, so far as it follows the principle of
          sufficient reason. No man has ever lived in the past, and none will
          live in the future; the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">present</span></em> alone is the form of all
          life, and is its sure possession which can never be taken from it.
          The present always exists, together with its content. Both remain
          fixed without wavering, like the rainbow on the waterfall. For life
          is firm and certain in the will, and the present is firm and
          certain in life. Certainly, if we reflect on <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page359">[pg 359]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg359"></a> the thousands of years that are past,
          of the millions of men who lived in them, we ask, What were they?
          what has become of them? But, on the other hand, we need only
          recall our own past life and renew its scenes vividly in our
          imagination, and then ask again, What was all this? what has become
          of it? As it is with it, so is it with the life of those millions.
          Or should we suppose that the past could receive a new existence
          because it has been sealed by death? Our own past, the most recent
          part of it, and even yesterday, is now no more than an empty dream
          of the fancy, and such is the past of all those millions. What was?
          What is? The will, of which life is the mirror, and knowledge free
          from will, which beholds it clearly in that mirror. Whoever has not
          yet recognised this, or will not recognise it, must add to the
          question asked above as to the fate of past generations of men this
          question also: Why he, the questioner, is so fortunate as to be
          conscious of this costly, fleeting, and only real present, while
          those hundreds of generations of men, even the heroes and
          philosophers of those ages, have sunk into the night of the past,
          and have thus become nothing; but he, his insignificant ego,
          actually exists? or more shortly, though somewhat strangely: Why
          this now, his now, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></em> just now and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">was</span></em> not
          long ago? Since he asks such strange questions, he regards his
          existence and his time as independent of each other, and the former
          as projected into the latter. He assumes indeed two nows—one which
          belongs to the object, the other which belongs to the subject, and
          marvels at the happy accident of their coincidence. But in truth,
          only the point of contact of the object, the form of which is time,
          with the subject, which has no mode of the principle of sufficient
          reason as its form, constitutes the present, as is shown in the
          essay on the principle of sufficient reason. Now all object is the
          will so far as it has become idea, and the subject is the necessary
          correlative of the object. But real objects are only in the
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page360">[pg 360]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg360"></a> present; the past
          and the future contain only conceptions and fancies, therefore the
          present is the essential form of the phenomenon of the will, and
          inseparable from it. The present alone is that which always exists
          and remains immovable. That which, empirically apprehended, is the
          most transitory of all, presents itself to the metaphysical vision,
          which sees beyond the forms of empirical perception, as that which
          alone endures, the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">nunc
          stans</span></span> of the schoolmen. The source and the supporter
          of its content is the will to live or the thing-in-itself,—which we
          are. That which constantly becomes and passes away, in that it has
          either already been or is still to be, belongs to the phenomenon as
          such on account of its forms, which make coming into being and
          passing away possible. Accordingly, we must think:—<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Quid fuit?</span></span>—<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Quod est.</span></span> <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Quid erit?</span></span>—<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Quod fuit;</span></span> and take it in the
          strict meaning of the words; thus understand not <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">simile</span></span> but <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">idem</span></span>. For life is certain to the
          will, and the present is certain to life. Thus it is that every one
          can say, <span class="tei tei-q">“I am once for all lord of the
          present, and through all eternity it will accompany me as my
          shadow: therefore I do not wonder where it has come from, and how
          it happens that it is exactly now.”</span> We might compare time to
          a constantly revolving sphere; the half that was always sinking
          would be the past, that which was always rising would be the
          future; but the indivisible point at the top, where the tangent
          touches, would be the extensionless present. As the tangent does
          not revolve with the sphere, neither does the present, the point of
          contact of the object, the form of which is time, with the subject,
          which has no form, because it does not belong to the knowable, but
          is the condition of all that is knowable. Or, time is like an
          unceasing stream, and the present a rock on which the stream breaks
          itself, but does not carry away with it. The will, as
          thing-in-itself, is just as little subordinate to the principle of
          sufficient reason <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page361">[pg
          361]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg361"></a>
          as the subject of knowledge, which, finally, in a certain regard is
          the will itself or its expression. And as life, its own phenomenon,
          is assured to the will, so is the present, the single form of real
          life. Therefore we have not to investigate the past before life,
          nor the future after death: we have rather to know the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">present</span></em>, the one form in which the
          will manifests itself.<a href="#note_65" id="noteref_65" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">65</span></span></a> It
          will not escape from the will, but neither will the will escape
          from it. If, therefore, life as it is satisfies, whoever affirms it
          in every way may regard it with confidence as endless, and banish
          the fear of death as an illusion that inspires him with the foolish
          dread that he can ever be robbed of the present, and foreshadows a
          time in which there is no present; an illusion with regard to time
          analogous to the illusion with regard to space through which every
          one imagines the position on the globe he happens to occupy as
          above, and all other places as below. In the same way every one
          links the present to his own individuality, and imagines that all
          present is extinguished with it; that then past and future might be
          without a present. But as on the surface of the globe every place
          is above, so the form of all life is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">present</span></em>, and to fear death because
          it robs us of the present, is just as foolish as to fear that we
          may slip down from the round globe upon which we have now the good
          fortune to occupy the upper surface. The present is the form
          essential to the objectification of the will. It cuts time, which
          extends infinitely in both directions, as a mathematical point, and
          stands immovably fixed, like an everlasting mid-day with no cool
          evening, as the actual sun burns without intermission, while it
          only seems to sink into the bosom of night. Therefore, if a man
          fears death as his annihilation, it is just as if he were to think
          that the sun cries out at evening, <span class="tei tei-q">“Woe is
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page362">[pg 362]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg362"></a> me! for I go down
          into eternal night.”</span><a href="#note_66" id="noteref_66" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">66</span></span></a> And
          conversely, whoever is oppressed with the burden of life, whoever
          desires life and affirms it, but abhors its torments, and
          especially can no longer endure the hard lot that has fallen to
          himself, such a man has no deliverance to hope for from death, and
          cannot right himself by suicide. The cool shades of Orcus allure
          him only with the false appearance of a haven of rest. The earth
          rolls from day into night, the individual dies, but the sun itself
          shines without intermission, an eternal noon. Life is assured to
          the will to live; the form of life is an endless present, no matter
          how the individuals, the phenomena of the Idea, arise and pass away
          in time, like fleeting dreams. Thus even already suicide appears to
          us as a vain and therefore a foolish action; when we have carried
          our investigation further it will appear to us in a still less
          favourable light.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Dogmas change
          and our knowledge is deceptive; but Nature never errs, her
          procedure is sure, and she never conceals it. Everything is
          entirely in Nature, and Nature is entire in everything. She has her
          centre in every brute. It has surely found its way into existence,
          and it will surely find its way out of it. In the meantime it
          lives, fearless and without care, in the presence of annihilation,
          supported by the consciousness that it is Nature herself, and
          imperishable as she is. Man alone carries about with him, in
          abstract conceptions, the certainty of his death; yet this can only
          trouble him very rarely, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page363">[pg
          363]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg363"></a>
          when for a single moment some occasion calls it up to his
          imagination. Against the mighty voice of Nature reflection can do
          little. In man, as in the brute which does not think, the certainty
          that springs from his inmost consciousness that he himself is
          Nature, the world, predominates as a lasting frame of mind; and on
          account of this no man is observably disturbed by the thought of
          certain and never-distant death, but lives as if he would live for
          ever. Indeed this is carried so far that we may say that no one has
          really a lively conviction of the certainty of his death, otherwise
          there would be no great difference between his frame of mind and
          that of a condemned criminal. Every one recognises that certainty
          in the abstract and theoretically, but lays it aside like other
          theoretical truths which are not applicable to practice, without
          really receiving it into his living consciousness. Whoever
          carefully considers this peculiarity of human character will see
          that the psychological explanations of it, from habit and
          acquiescence in the inevitable, are by no means sufficient, and
          that its true explanation lies in the deeper ground we have given.
          The same fact explains the circumstance that at all times and among
          all peoples dogmas of some kind or other relating to the continued
          existence of the individual after death arise, and are believed in,
          although the evidence in support of them must always be very
          insufficient, and the evidence against them forcible and varied.
          But, in truth, this really requires no proof, but is recognised by
          the healthy understanding as a fact, and confirmed by the
          confidence that Nature never lies any more than she errs, but
          openly exhibits and naïvely expresses her action and her nature,
          while only we ourselves obscure it by our folly, in order to
          establish what is agreeable to our limited point of view.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But this that we
          have brought to clearest consciousness, that although the
          particular phenomenon of the will has a temporal beginning and end,
          the will itself as thing-in-itself is not affected by it, nor yet
          the correlative of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page364">[pg
          364]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg364"></a>
          all object, the knowing but never known subject, and that life is
          always assured to the will to live—this is not to be numbered with
          the doctrines of immortality. For permanence has no more to do with
          the will or with the pure subject of knowing, the eternal eye of
          the world, than transitoriness, for both are predicates that are
          only valid in time, and the will and the pure subject of knowing
          lie outside time. Therefore the egoism of the individual (this
          particular phenomenon of will enlightened by the subject of
          knowing) can extract as little nourishment and consolation for his
          wish to endure through endless time from the view we have
          expressed, as he could from the knowledge that after his death the
          rest of the eternal world would continue to exist, which is just
          the expression of the same view considered objectively, and
          therefore temporally. For every individual is transitory only as
          phenomenon, but as thing-in-itself is timeless, and therefore
          endless. But it is also only as phenomenon that an individual is
          distinguished from the other things of the world; as
          thing-in-itself he is the will which appears in all, and death
          destroys the illusion which separates his consciousness from that
          of the rest: this is immortality. His exemption from death, which
          belongs to him only as thing-in-itself, is for the phenomenon one
          with the immortality of the rest of the external world.<a href="#note_67" id="noteref_67" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">67</span></span></a> Hence
          also, it arises that although the inward and merely felt
          consciousness of that which we have raised to distinct knowledge is
          indeed, as we have said, sufficient to prevent the thought of death
          from poisoning the life of the rational being, because this
          consciousness is the basis of that love of life which maintains
          everything living, and enables it to live on <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page365">[pg 365]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg365"></a> at ease as if there were no such thing
          as death, so long as it is face to face with life, and turns its
          attention to it, yet it will not prevent the individual from being
          seized with the fear of death, and trying in every way to escape
          from it, when it presents itself to him in some particular real
          case, or even only in his imagination, and he is compelled to
          contemplate it. For just as, so long as his knowledge was directed
          to life as such, he was obliged to recognise immortality in it, so
          when death is brought before his eyes, he is obliged to recognise
          it as that which it is, the temporal end of the particular temporal
          phenomenon. What we fear in death is by no means the pain, for it
          lies clearly on this side of death, and, moreover, we often take
          refuge in death from pain, just as, on the contrary, we sometimes
          endure the most fearful suffering merely to escape death for a
          while, although it would be quick and easy. Thus we distinguish
          pain and death as two entirely different evils. What we fear in
          death is the end of the individual, which it openly professes
          itself to be, and since the individual is a particular
          objectification of the will to live itself, its whole nature
          struggles against death. Now when feeling thus exposes us helpless,
          reason can yet step in and for the most part overcome its adverse
          influence, for it places us upon a higher standpoint, from which we
          no longer contemplate the particular but the whole. Therefore a
          philosophical knowledge of the nature of the world, which extended
          to the point we have now reached in this work but went no farther,
          could even at this point of view overcome the terror of death in
          the measure in which reflection had power over direct feeling in
          the given individual. A man who had thoroughly assimilated the
          truths we have already advanced, but had not come to know, either
          from his own experience or from a deeper insight, that constant
          suffering is essential to life, who found satisfaction and all that
          he wished in life, and could calmly and deliberately desire that
          his <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page366">[pg 366]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg366"></a> life, as he had
          hitherto known it, should endure for ever or repeat itself ever
          anew, and whose love of life was so great that he willingly and
          gladly accepted all the hardships and miseries to which it is
          exposed for the sake of its pleasures,—such a man would stand
          <span class="tei tei-q">“with firm-knit bones on the well-rounded,
          enduring earth,”</span> and would have nothing to fear. Armed with
          the knowledge we have given him, he would await with indifference
          the death that hastens towards him on the wings of time. He would
          regard it as a false illusion, an impotent spectre, which frightens
          the weak but has no power over him who knows that he is himself the
          will of which the whole world is the objectification or copy, and
          that therefore he is always certain of life, and also of the
          present, the peculiar and only form of the phenomenon of the will.
          He could not be terrified by an endless past or future in which he
          would not be, for this he would regard as the empty delusion of the
          web of Mâya. Thus he would no more fear death than the sun fears
          the night. In the <span class="tei tei-q">“Bhagavad-Gita”</span>
          Krishna thus raises the mind of his young pupil Arjuna, when,
          seized with compunction at the sight of the arrayed hosts (somewhat
          as Xerxes was), he loses heart and desires to give up the battle in
          order to avert the death of so many thousands. Krishna leads him to
          this point of view, and the death of those thousands can no longer
          restrain him; he gives the sign for battle. This point of view is
          also expressed by Goethe's Prometheus, especially when he says—</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The philosophy
          of Bruno and that of Spinoza might also lead any one to this point
          of view whose conviction was <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page367">[pg 367]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg367"></a> not shaken and weakened by their errors and
          imperfections. That of Bruno has properly no ethical theory at all,
          and the theory contained in the philosophy of Spinoza does not
          really proceed from the inner nature of his doctrine, but is merely
          tacked on to it by means of weak and palpable sophisms, though in
          itself it is praiseworthy and beautiful. Finally, there are many
          men who would occupy this point of view if their knowledge kept
          pace with their will, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, if, free from all
          illusion, they were in a position to become clearly and distinctly
          themselves. For this is, for knowledge, the point of view of the
          complete <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">assertion of the will to live</span></em>.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That the will
          asserts itself means, that while in its objectivity, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          in the world and life, its own nature is completely and distinctly
          given it as idea, this knowledge does not by any means check its
          volition; but this very life, so known, is willed as such by the
          will with knowledge, consciously and deliberately, just as up to
          this point it willed it as blind effort without knowledge. The
          opposite of this, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">denial of the will to live</span></em>, shows
          itself if, when that knowledge is attained, volition ends, because
          the particular known phenomena no longer act as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">motives</span></em>
          for willing, but the whole knowledge of the nature of the world,
          the mirror of the will, which has grown up through the
          comprehension of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ideas</span></em>, becomes a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">quieter</span></em>
          of the will; and thus free, the will suppresses itself. These quite
          unfamiliar conceptions are difficult to understand when expressed
          in this general way, but it is hoped they will become clear through
          the exposition we shall give presently, with special reference to
          action, of the phenomena in which, on the one hand, the assertion
          in its different grades, and, on the other hand, the denial,
          expresses itself. For both proceed from knowledge, yet not from
          abstract knowledge, which is expressed in words, but from living
          knowledge, which is expressed in action and behaviour alone, and is
          independent of the dogmas which at the same time occupy the reason
          as abstract knowledge. To <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page368">[pg
          368]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg368"></a>
          exhibit them both, and bring them to distinct knowledge of the
          reason, can alone be my aim, and not to prescribe or recommend the
          one or the other, which would be as foolish as it would be useless;
          for the will in itself is absolutely free and entirely
          self-determining, and for it there is no law. But before we go on
          to the exposition referred to, we must first explain and more
          exactly define this <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">freedom</span></em> and its relation to
          necessity. And also, with regard to the life, the assertion and
          denial of which is our problem, we must insert a few general
          remarks connected with the will and its objects. Through all this
          we shall facilitate the apprehension of the inmost nature of the
          knowledge we are aiming at, of the ethical significance of methods
          of action.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Since, as has
          been said, this whole work is only the unfolding of a single
          thought, it follows that all its parts have the most intimate
          connection with each other. Not merely that each part stands in a
          necessary relation to what immediately precedes it, and only
          presupposes a recollection of that by the reader, as is the case
          with all philosophies which consist merely of a series of
          inferences, but that every part of the whole work is related to
          every other part and presupposes it. It is, therefore, necessary
          that the reader should remember not only what has just been said,
          but all the earlier parts of the work, so that he may be able to
          connect them with what he is reading, however much may have
          intervened. Plato also makes this demand upon his readers through
          the intricate digressions of his dialogues, in which he only
          returns to the leading thought after long episodes, which
          illustrate and explain it. In our case this demand is necessary;
          for the breaking up of our one single thought into its many aspects
          is indeed the only means of imparting it, though not essential to
          the thought itself, but merely an artificial form. The division of
          four principal points of view into four books, and the most careful
          bringing together of all that is related and homogeneous, assists
          the exposition <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page369">[pg
          369]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg369"></a>
          and its comprehension; yet the material absolutely does not admit
          of an advance in a straight line, such as the progress of history,
          but necessitates a more complicated exposition. This again makes a
          repeated study of the book necessary, for thus alone does the
          connection of all the parts with each other become distinct, and
          only then do they all mutually throw light upon each other and
          become quite clear.<a href="#note_68" id="noteref_68" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">68</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 55. That the
          will as such is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">free</span></em>, follows from the fact that,
          according to our view, it is the thing-in-itself, the content of
          all phenomena. The phenomena, on the other hand, we recognise as
          absolutely subordinate to the principle of sufficient reason in its
          four forms. And since we know that necessity is throughout
          identical with following from given grounds, and that these are
          convertible conceptions, all that belongs to the phenomenon,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, all that is object for the
          knowing subject as individual, is in one aspect reason, and in
          another aspect consequent; and in this last capacity is determined
          with absolute necessity, and can, therefore, in no respect be other
          than it is. The whole content of Nature, the collective sum of its
          phenomena, is thus throughout necessary, and the necessity of every
          part, of every phenomenon, of every event, can always be proved,
          because it must be possible to find the reason from which it
          follows as a consequent. This admits of no exception: it follows
          from the unrestricted validity of the principle of sufficient
          reason. In another aspect, however, the same world is for us, in
          all its phenomena, objectivity of will. And the will, since it is
          not phenomenon, is not idea or object, but thing-in-itself, and is
          not subordinate to the principle of sufficient reason, the form of
          all object; thus is not determined as a consequent through any
          reason, knows no necessity, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">free</span></em>.
          The concept of freedom is thus <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page370">[pg 370]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg370"></a> properly a negative concept, for its content
          is merely the denial of necessity, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          the relation of consequent to its reason, according to the
          principle of sufficient reason. Now here lies before us in its most
          distinct form the solution of that great contradiction, the union
          of freedom with necessity, which has so often been discussed in
          recent times, yet, so far as I know, never clearly and adequately.
          Everything is as phenomenon, as object, absolutely necessary:
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in
          itself</span></em> it is will, which is perfectly free to all
          eternity. The phenomenon, the object, is necessarily and
          unalterably determined in that chain of causes and effects which
          admits of no interruption. But the existence in general of this
          object, and its specific nature, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          the Idea which reveals itself in it, or, in other words, its
          character, is a direct manifestation of will. Thus, in conformity
          with the freedom of this will, the object might not be at all, or
          it might be originally and essentially something quite different
          from what it is, in which case, however, the whole chain of which
          it is a link, and which is itself a manifestation of the same will,
          would be quite different also. But once there and existing, it has
          entered the chain of causes and effects, is always necessarily
          determined in it, and can, therefore, neither become something
          else, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, change itself, nor yet
          escape from the chain, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, vanish. Man, like every
          other part of Nature, is objectivity of the will; therefore all
          that has been said holds good of him. As everything in Nature has
          its forces and qualities, which react in a definite way when
          definitely affected, and constitute its character, man also has his
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">character</span></em>, from which the motives
          call forth his actions with necessity. In this manner of conduct
          his empirical character reveals itself, but in this again his
          intelligible character, the will in itself, whose determined
          phenomenon he is. But man is the most complete phenomenon of will,
          and, as we explained in the Second Book, he had to be enlightened
          with so high a degree of knowledge <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page371">[pg 371]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg371"></a> in order to maintain himself in existence,
          that in it a perfectly adequate copy or repetition of the nature of
          the world under the form of the idea became possible: this is the
          comprehension of the Ideas, the pure mirror of the world, as we
          learnt in the Third Book. Thus in man the will can attain to full
          self-consciousness, to distinct and exhaustive knowledge of its own
          nature, as it mirrors itself in the whole world. We saw in the
          preceding book that art springs from the actual presence of this
          degree of knowledge; and at the end of our whole work it will
          further appear that, through the same knowledge, in that the will
          relates it to itself, a suppression and self-denial of the will in
          its most perfect manifestation is possible. So that the freedom
          which otherwise, as belonging to the thing-in-itself, can never
          show itself in the phenomenon, in such a case does also appear in
          it, and, by abolishing the nature which lies at the foundation of
          the phenomenon, while the latter itself still continues to exist in
          time, it brings about a contradiction of the phenomenon with
          itself, and in this way exhibits the phenomena of holiness and
          self-renunciation. But all this can only be fully understood at the
          end of this book. What has just been said merely affords a
          preliminary and general indication of how man is distinguished from
          all the other phenomena of will by the fact that freedom,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, independence of the
          principle of sufficient reason, which only belongs to the will as
          thing-in-itself, and contradicts the phenomenon, may yet possibly,
          in his case, appear in the phenomenon also, where, however, it
          necessarily exhibits itself as a contradiction of the phenomenon
          with itself. In this sense, not only the will in itself, but man
          also may certainly be called free, and thus distinguished from all
          other beings. But how this is to be understood can only become
          clear through all that is to follow, and for the present we must
          turn away from it altogether. For, in the first place, we must
          beware of the error that the action of the individual definite man
          is subject to no <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page372">[pg
          372]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg372"></a>
          necessity, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, that the power of the
          motive is less certain than the power of the cause, or the
          following of the conclusion from the premises. The freedom of the
          will as thing-in-itself, if, as has been said, we abstract from the
          entirely exceptional case mentioned above, by no means extends
          directly to its phenomenon, not even in the case in which this
          reaches the highest made of its visibility, and thus does not
          extend to the rational animal endowed with individual character,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the person. The person is
          never free although he is the phenomenon of a free will; for he is
          already the determined phenomenon of the free volition of this
          will, and, because he enters the form of every object, the
          principle of sufficient reason, he develops indeed the unity of
          that will in a multiplicity of actions, but on account of the
          timeless unity of that volition in itself, this multiplicity
          exhibits in itself the regular conformity to law of a force of
          Nature. Since, however, it is that free volition that becomes
          visible in the person and the whole of his conduct, relating itself
          to him as the concept to the definition, every individual action of
          the person is to be ascribed to the free will, and directly
          proclaims itself as such in consciousness. Therefore, as was said
          in the Second Book, every one regards himself <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          here in this original feeling) as free in his individual actions,
          in the sense that in every given case every action is possible for
          him, and he only recognises <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          posteriori</span></span> from experience and reflection upon
          experience that his actions take place with absolute necessity from
          the coincidence of his character with his motives. Hence it arises
          that every uncultured man, following his feeling, ardently defends
          complete freedom in particular actions, while the great thinkers of
          all ages, and indeed the more profound systems of religion, have
          denied it. But whoever has come to see clearly that the whole
          nature of man is will, and he himself only a phenomenon of this
          will, and that such a phenomenon has, even from the subject itself,
          the principle of sufficient reason as its <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page373">[pg 373]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg373"></a> necessary form, which here appears as the law
          of motivation,—such a man will regard it as just as absurd to doubt
          the inevitable nature of an action when the motive is presented to
          a given character, as to doubt that the three angles of any
          triangle are together equal to two right angles. Priestley has very
          sufficiently proved the necessity of the individual action in his
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Doctrine of Philosophical
          Necessity;”</span> but Kant, whose merit in this respect is
          specially great, first proved the coexistence of this necessity
          with the freedom of the will in itself, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          apart from the phenomenon,<a href="#note_69" id="noteref_69" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">69</span></span></a> by
          establishing the distinction between the intelligible and the
          empirical character. I entirely adhere to this distinction, for the
          former is the will as thing-in-itself so far as it appears in a
          definite individual in a definite grade, and the latter is this
          phenomenon itself as it exhibits itself in time in the mode of
          action, and in space in the physical structure. In order to make
          the relation of the two comprehensible, the best expression is that
          which I have already used in the introductory essay, that the
          intelligible character of every man is to be regarded as an act of
          will outside time, and therefore indivisible and unchangeable, and
          the manifestation of this act of will developed and broken up in
          time and space and all the forms of the principle of sufficient
          reason is the empirical character as it exhibits itself for
          experience in the whole conduct and life of this man. As the whole
          tree is only the constantly repeated manifestation of one and the
          same tendency, which exhibits itself in its simplest form in the
          fibre, and recurs and is easily recognised in the construction of
          the leaf, shoot, branch, and trunk, so all a man's deeds are merely
          the constantly repeated expression, somewhat varied in form, of his
          intelligible character, and the induction based on the sum of all
          these expressions gives us his empirical <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page374">[pg 374]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg374"></a> character. For the rest, I shall not at this
          point repeat in my own words Kant's masterly exposition, but
          presuppose it as known.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the year 1840
          I dealt with the important chapter on the freedom of the will,
          thoroughly and in detail, in my crowned prize-essay upon the
          subject, and exposed the reason of the delusion which led men to
          imagine that they found an empirically given absolute freedom of
          the will, that is to say, a <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">liberum arbitrium
          indifferentiæ</span></span>, as a fact in self-consciousness; for
          the question propounded for the essay was with great insight
          directed to this point. Therefore, as I refer the reader to that
          work, and also to the tenth paragraph of the prize-essay on the
          basis of morals, which was published along with it under the title
          <span class="tei tei-q">“The Two Fundamental Problems of
          Ethics,”</span> I now omit the incomplete exposition of the
          necessity of the act of will, which was given at this place in the
          first edition. Instead of it I shall explain the delusion mentioned
          above in a brief discussion which is presupposed in the nineteenth
          chapter of the supplement to the present work, and therefore could
          not be given in the prize-essay referred to.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Apart from the
          fact that the will as the true thing-in-itself is actually original
          and independent, and that the feeling of its originality and
          absoluteness must accompany its acts in self-consciousness, though
          here they are already determined, there arises the illusion of an
          empirical freedom of the will (instead of the transcendental
          freedom which alone is to be attributed to it), and thus a freedom
          of its particular actions, from that attitude of the intellect
          towards the will which is explained, separated, and subordinated in
          the nineteenth chapter of the supplement, especially under No. 3.
          The intellect knows the conclusions of the will only <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a posteriori</span></span> and empirically;
          therefore when a choice is presented, it has no data as to how the
          will is to decide. For the intelligible character, by virtue of
          which, when motives are given, only <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page375">[pg 375]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg375"></a> decision is possible
          and is therefore necessary, does not come within the knowledge of
          the intellect, but merely the empirical character is known to it
          through the succession of its particular acts. Therefore it seems
          to the intellect that in a given case two opposite decisions are
          possible for the will. But this is just the same thing as if we
          were to say of a perpendicular beam that has lost its balance, and
          is hesitating which way to fall, <span class="tei tei-q">“It can
          fall either to the right hand or the left.”</span> This <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">can</span></em> has
          merely a subjective significance, and really means <span class="tei tei-q">“as far as the data known to us are concerned.”</span>
          Objectively, the direction of the fall is necessarily determined as
          soon as the equilibrium is lost. Accordingly, the decision of one's
          own will is undetermined only to the beholder, one's own intellect,
          and thus merely relatively and subjectively for the subject of
          knowing. In itself and objectively, on the other hand, in every
          choice presented to it, its decision is at once determined and
          necessary. But this determination only comes into consciousness
          through the decision that follows upon it. Indeed, we receive an
          empirical proof of this when any difficult and important choice
          lies before us, but only under a condition which is not yet
          present, but merely hoped for, so that in the meanwhile we can do
          nothing, but must remain passive. Now we consider how we shall
          decide when the circumstances occur that will give us a free
          activity and choice. Generally the foresight of rational
          deliberation recommends one decision, while direct inclination
          leans rather to the other. So long as we are compelled to remain
          passive, the side of reason seems to wish to keep the upper hand;
          but we see beforehand how strongly the other side will influence us
          when the opportunity for action arises. Till then we are eagerly
          concerned to place the motives on both sides in the clearest light,
          by calm meditation on the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">pro et
          contra</span></span>, so that every motive may exert its full
          influence upon the will when the time arrives, and it may not be
          misled by a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page376">[pg
          376]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg376"></a>
          mistake on the part of the intellect to decide otherwise than it
          would have done if all the motives had their due influence upon it.
          But this distinct unfolding of the motives on both sides is all
          that the intellect can do to assist the choice. It awaits the real
          decision just as passively and with the same intense curiosity as
          if it were that of a foreign will. Therefore from its point of view
          both decisions must seem to it equally possible; and this is just
          the illusion of the empirical freedom of the will. Certainly the
          decision enters the sphere of the intellect altogether empirically,
          as the final conclusion of the matter; but yet it proceeded from
          the inner nature, the intelligible character, of the individual
          will in its conflict with given motives, and therefore with
          complete necessity. The intellect can do nothing more than bring
          out clearly and fully the nature of the motives; it cannot
          determine the will itself; for the will is quite inaccessible to
          it, and, as we have seen, cannot be investigated.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If, under the
          same circumstances, a man could act now one way and now another, it
          would be necessary that his will itself should have changed in the
          meantime, and thus that it should lie in time, for change is only
          possible in time; but then either the will would be a mere
          phenomenon, or time would be a condition of the thing-in-itself.
          Accordingly the dispute as to the freedom of the particular action,
          the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">liberum arbitrium
          indifferentiæ</span></span>, really turns on the question whether
          the will lies in time or not. If, as both Kant's doctrine and the
          whole of my system necessitates, the will is the thing-in-itself
          outside time and outside every form of the principle of sufficient
          reason, not only must the individual act in the same way in the
          same circumstances, and not only must every bad action be the sure
          warrant of innumerable others, which the individual <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">must</span></em>
          perform and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cannot</span></em> leave, but, as Kant said,
          if only the empirical character and the motives were completely
          given, it would be possible to calculate the future conduct of a
          man just as we can calculate an <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page377">[pg 377]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg377"></a> eclipse of the sun or moon. As Nature is
          consistent, so is the character; every action must take place in
          accordance with it, just as every phenomenon takes place according
          to a law of Nature: the causes in the latter case and the motives
          in the former are merely the occasional causes, as was shown in the
          Second Book. The will, whose phenomenon is the whole being and life
          of man, cannot deny itself in the particular case, and what the man
          wills on the whole, that will he also will in the particular
          case.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The assertion of
          an empirical freedom of the will, a <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">liberum arbitrium indifferentiæ</span></span>,
          agrees precisely with the doctrine that places the inner nature of
          man in a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">soul</span></em>, which is originally a
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">knowing</span></em>, and indeed really an
          abstract <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thinking</span></em> nature, and only in
          consequence of this a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">willing</span></em> nature—a doctrine which
          thus regards the will as of a secondary or derivative nature,
          instead of knowledge which is really so. The will indeed came to be
          regarded as an act of thought, and to be identified with the
          judgment, especially by Descartes and Spinoza. According to this
          doctrine every man must become what he is only through his
          knowledge; he must enter the world as a moral cipher come to know
          the things in it, and thereupon determine to be this or that, to
          act thus or thus, and may also through new knowledge achieve a new
          course of action, that is to say, become another person. Further,
          he must first know a thing to be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">good</span></em>,
          and in consequence of this will it, instead of first <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">willing</span></em>
          it, and in consequence of this calling it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">good</span></em>.
          According to my fundamental point of view, all this is a reversal
          of the true relation. Will is first and original; knowledge is
          merely added to it as an instrument belonging to the phenomenon of
          will. Therefore every man is what he is through his will, and his
          character is original, for willing is the basis of his nature.
          Through the knowledge which is added to it he comes to know in the
          course of experience <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">what he is</span></em>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          he learns his <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page378">[pg
          378]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg378"></a>
          character. Thus he <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">knows</span></em> himself in consequence of
          and in accordance with the nature of his will, instead of
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">willing</span></em> in consequence of and in
          accordance with his knowing. According to the latter view, he would
          only require to consider how he would like best to be, and he would
          be it; that is its doctrine of the freedom of the will. Thus it
          consists really in this, that a man is his own work guided by the
          light of knowledge. I, on the contrary, say that he is his own work
          before all knowledge, and knowledge is merely added to it to
          enlighten it. Therefore he cannot resolve to be this or that, nor
          can he become other than he is; but he <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></em> once
          for all, and he knows in the course of experience <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">what</span></em> he
          is. According to one doctrine he <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">wills</span></em>
          what he knows, and according to the other he <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">knows</span></em>
          what he wills.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Greeks
          called the character ηθος, and its expression, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          morals, ηθη. But this word comes from εθος, custom; they chose it
          in order to express metaphorically the constancy of character
          through the constancy of custom. Το γαρ ηθος απο του εθους εχει την
          επωνυμιαν. ηθικε γαρ καλειται δια το εθιζεσθαι (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a voce</span></span> ηθος, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,

          Aristotle (Eth. Magna, i. 6, p. 1186, and Eth. Eud., p. 1220, and
          Eth. Nic., p. 1103, ed. Ber.) Stobæus quotes: οἱ δε κατα Ζηνωνα
          τροπικως; ηθος εστι πηγη βιου αφ᾽ ἡς αἱ κατα μερος πραξεις ρεουσι
          (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Stoici autem, Zenonis castra sequentes,
          metaphorice ethos definiunt vitæ fontem, e quo singulæ manant
          actiones</span></span>), ii. ch. 7. In Christian theology we find
          the dogma of predestination in consequence of election and
          non-election (Rom. ix. 11-24), clearly originating from the
          knowledge that man does not change himself, but his life and
          conduct, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, his empirical character,
          is only the unfolding of his intelligible character, the
          development of decided and unchangeable natural dispositions
          recognisable even in the child; therefore, as it were, even at his
          birth his conduct is firmly determined, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page379">[pg 379]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg379"></a> remains essentially the same to the
          end. This we entirely agree with; but certainly the consequences
          which followed from the union of this perfectly correct insight
          with the dogmas that already existed in Jewish theology, and which
          now gave rise to the great difficulty, the Gordian knot upon which
          most of the controversies of the Church turned, I do not undertake
          to defend, for even the Apostle Paul scarcely succeeded in doing so
          by means of his simile of the potter's vessels which he invented
          for the purpose, for the result he finally arrived at was nothing
          else than this:—</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such
          considerations, however, are really foreign to our subject. Some
          explanation as to the relation between the character and the
          knowledge in which all its motives lie, will now be more to the
          point.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The motives
          which determine the manifestation of the character or conduct
          influence it through the medium of knowledge. But knowledge is
          changeable, and often vacillates between truth and error, yet, as a
          rule, is rectified more and more in the course of life, though
          certainly in very different degrees. Therefore the conduct of a man
          may be observably altered without justifying us in concluding that
          his character has been changed. What the man really and in general
          wills, the striving of his inmost nature, and the end he pursues in
          accordance with it, this we can never change by influence upon him
          from without by instruction, otherwise we could transform him.
          Seneca says admirably, <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">velle non
          discitur</span></span>; whereby he preferred truth to his Stoic
          philosophers, who taught διδακτην ειναι την αρετην (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">doceri posse virtutem</span></span>). From
          without the will can only be affected by motives. But <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page380">[pg 380]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg380"></a> these can never change the will itself;
          for they have power over it only under the presupposition that it
          is precisely such as it is. All that they can do is thus to alter
          the direction of its effort, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, bring it about that it
          shall seek in another way than it has hitherto done that which it
          invariably seeks. Therefore instruction, improved knowledge, in
          other words, influence from without, may indeed teach the will that
          it erred in the means it employed, and can therefore bring it about
          that the end after which it strives once for all according to its
          inner nature shall be pursued on an entirely different path and in
          an entirely different object from what has hitherto been the case.
          But it can never bring about that the will shall will something
          actually different from what it has hitherto willed; this remains
          unchangeable, for the will is simply this willing itself, which
          would have to be abolished. The former, however, the possible
          modification of knowledge, and through knowledge of conduct,
          extends so far that the will seeks to attain its unalterable end,
          for example, Mohammed's paradise, at one time in the real world, at
          another time in a world of imagination, adapting the means to each,
          and thus in the first case applying prudence, might, and fraud, and
          in the second case, abstinence, justice, alms, and pilgrimages to
          Mecca. But its effort itself has not therefore changed, still less
          the will itself. Thus, although its action certainly shows itself
          very different at different times, its willing has yet remained
          precisely the same. <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Velle non
          discitur.</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For motives to
          act, it is necessary not only that they should be present, but that
          they should be known; for, according to a very good expression of
          the schoolmen, which we referred to once before, <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">causa finalis movet non secundum suum esse
          reale; sed secundum esse cognitum</span></span>. For example, in
          order that the relation may appear that exists in a given man
          between egoism and sympathy, it is not sufficient that he should
          possess wealth <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page381">[pg
          381]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg381"></a>
          and see others in want, but he must also know what he can do with
          his wealth, both for himself and for others: not only must the
          suffering of others be presented to him, but he must know both what
          suffering and also what pleasure is. Perhaps, on a first occasion,
          he did not know all this so well as on a second; and if, on a
          similar occasion, he acts differently, this arises simply from the
          fact that the circumstances were really different, as regards the
          part of them that depends on his knowing them, although they seem
          to be the same. As ignorance of actually existing circumstances
          robs them of their influence, so, on the other hand, entirely
          imaginary circumstances may act as if they were real, not only in
          the case of a particular deception, but also in general and
          continuously. For example, if a man is firmly persuaded that every
          good action will be repaid him a hundredfold in a future life, such
          a conviction affects him in precisely the same way as a good bill
          of exchange at a very long date, and he can give from mere egoism,
          as from another point of view he would take from egoism. He has not
          changed himself: <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">velle non
          discitur.</span></span> It is on account of this great influence of
          knowledge upon action, while the will remains unchangeable, that
          the character develops and its different features appear only
          little by little. Therefore it shows itself different at every
          period of life, and an impetuous, wild youth may be succeeded by a
          staid, sober, manly age. Especially what is bad in the character
          will always come out more strongly with time, yet sometimes it
          occurs that passions which a man gave way to in his youth are
          afterwards voluntarily restrained, simply because the motives
          opposed to them have only then come into knowledge. Hence, also, we
          are all innocent to begin with, and this merely means that neither
          we nor others know the evil of our own nature; it only appears with
          the motives, and only in time do the motives appear in knowledge.
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page382">[pg 382]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg382"></a> Finally we come to
          know ourselves as quite different from what <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          priori</span></span> we supposed ourselves to be, and then we are
          often terrified at ourselves.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Repentance never
          proceeds from a change of the will (which is impossible), but from
          a change of knowledge. The essential and peculiar in what I have
          always willed I must still continue to will; for I myself am this
          will which lies outside time and change. I can therefore never
          repent of what I have willed, though I can repent of what I have
          done; because, led by false conceptions, I did something that was
          not in conformity with my will. The discovery of this through
          fuller knowledge is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">repentance</span></em>. This extends not
          merely to worldly wisdom, to the choice of the means, and the
          judgment of the appropriateness of the end to my own will, but also
          to what is properly ethical. For example, I may have acted more
          egotistically than is in accordance with my character, led astray
          by exaggerated ideas of the need in which I myself stood, or of the
          craft, falseness, and wickedness of others, or because I hurried
          too much, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, acted without
          deliberation, determined not by motives distinctly known
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">in abstracto</span></span>, but by merely
          perceived motives, by the present and the emotion which it excited,
          and which was so strong that I had not properly the use of my
          reason; but the return of reflection is thus here also merely
          corrected knowledge, and from this repentance may proceed, which
          always proclaims itself by making amends for the past, as far as is
          possible. Yet it must be observed that, in order to deceive
          themselves, men prearrange what seem to be hasty errors, but are
          really secretly considered actions. For we deceive and flatter no
          one through such fine devices as ourselves. The converse of the
          case we have given may also occur. I may be misled by too good an
          opinion of others, or want of knowledge of the relative value of
          the good things of life, or some abstract dogma in which I have
          since lost faith, and thus I may act less egotistically than is in
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page383">[pg 383]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg383"></a> keeping with my
          character, and lay up for myself repentance of another kind. Thus
          repentance is always corrected knowledge of the relation of an act
          to its special intention. When the will reveals its Ideas in space
          alone, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, through mere form, the
          matter in which other Ideas—in this case natural forces—already
          reign, resists the will, and seldom allows the form that is
          striving after visibility to appear in perfect purity and
          distinctness, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, in perfect beauty. And
          there is an analogous hindrance to the will as it reveals itself in
          time alone, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, through actions, in the
          knowledge which seldom gives it the data quite correctly, so that
          the action which takes place does not accurately correspond to the
          will, and leads to repentance. Repentance thus always proceeds from
          corrected knowledge, not from the change of the will, which is
          impossible. Anguish of conscience for past deeds is anything but
          repentance. It is pain at the knowledge of oneself in one's inmost
          nature, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, as will. It rests
          precisely on the certainty that we have still the same will. If the
          will were changed, and therefore the anguish of conscience mere
          repentance, it would cease to exist. The past could then no longer
          give us pain, for it exhibited the expressions of a will which is
          no longer that of him who has repented. We shall explain the
          significance of anguish of conscience in detail farther on.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The influence
          which knowledge, as the medium of motives, exerts, not indeed upon
          the will itself, but upon its appearance in actions, is also the
          source of the principal distinction between the action of men and
          that of brutes, for their methods of knowledge are different. The
          brute has only knowledge of perception, the man, through reason,
          has also abstract ideas, conceptions. Now, although man and brute
          are with equal necessity determined by their motives, yet man, as
          distinguished from the brute, has a complete <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">choice</span></em>,
          which has often been regarded as a freedom of the will in
          particular actions, although it is nothing but the possibility of a
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page384">[pg 384]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg384"></a>
          thoroughly-fought-out battle between several motives, the strongest
          of which then determines it with necessity. For this the motives
          must have assumed the form of abstract thoughts, because it is
          really only by means of these that deliberation, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, a
          weighing of opposite reasons for action, is possible. In the case
          of the brute there can only be a choice between perceptible motives
          presented to it, so that the choice is limited to the narrow sphere
          of its present sensuous perception. Therefore the necessity of the
          determination of the will by the motive, which is like that of the
          effect by the cause, can be exhibited perceptibly and directly only
          in the case of the brutes, because here the spectator has the
          motives just as directly before his eyes as their effect; while in
          the case of man the motives are almost always abstract ideas, which
          are not communicated to the spectator, and even for the actor
          himself the necessity of their effect is hidden behind their
          conflict. For only <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">in
          abstracto</span></span> can several ideas, as judgments and chains
          of conclusions, lie beside each other in consciousness, and then,
          free from all determination of time, work against each other till
          the stronger overcomes the rest and determines the will. This is
          the complete <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">choice</span></em> or power of deliberation
          which man has as distinguished from the brutes, and on account of
          which freedom of the will has been attributed to him, in the belief
          that his willing is a mere result of the operations of his
          intellect, without a definite tendency which serves as its basis;
          while, in truth, the motives only work on the foundation and under
          the presupposition of his definite tendency, which in his case is
          individual, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, a character. A fuller
          exposition of this power of deliberation, and the difference
          between human and brute choice which is introduced by it, will be
          found in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Two Fundamental Problems of
          Ethics”</span> (1st edition, p. 35, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">et
          seq.</span></span>; 2d edition, p. 34, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">et
          seq.</span></span>), to which I therefore refer. For the rest, this
          power of deliberation which man possesses is one of those things
          that makes his <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page385">[pg
          385]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg385"></a>
          existence so much more miserable than that of the brute. For in
          general our greatest sufferings do not lie in the present as ideas
          of perception or as immediate feelings; but in the reason, as
          abstract conceptions, painful thoughts, from which the brute, which
          lives only in the present, and therefore in enviable carelessness,
          is entirely free.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It seems to have
          been the dependence, which we have shown, of the human power of
          deliberation upon the faculty of abstract thinking, and thus also
          of judging and drawing conclusions also, that led both Descartes
          and Spinoza to identify the decisions of the will with the faculty
          of asserting and denying (the faculty of judgment). From this
          Descartes deduced the doctrine that the will, which, according to
          him, is indifferently free, is the source of sin, and also of all
          theoretical error. And Spinoza, on the other hand, concluded that
          the will is necessarily determined by the motives, as the judgment
          is by the reasons.<a href="#note_70" id="noteref_70" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">70</span></span></a> The
          latter doctrine is in a sense true, but it appears as a true
          conclusion from false premises.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The distinction
          we have established between the ways in which the brutes and man
          are respectively moved by motives exerts a very wide influence upon
          the nature of both, and has most to do with the complete and
          obvious differences of their existence. While an idea of perception
          is in every case the motive which determines the brute, the man
          strives to exclude this kind of motivation altogether, and to
          determine himself entirely by abstract ideas. Thus he uses his
          prerogative of reason to the greatest possible advantage.
          Independent of the present, he neither chooses nor avoids the
          passing pleasure or pain, but reflects on the consequences of both.
          In most cases, setting aside quite insignificant actions, we are
          determined by abstract, thought motives, not present impressions.
          Therefore all particular privation for the moment is for us
          comparatively light, but all renunciation is terribly <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page386">[pg 386]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg386"></a> hard; for the former only concerns the
          fleeting present, but the latter concerns the future, and includes
          in itself innumerable privations, of which it is the equivalent.
          The causes of our pain, as of our pleasure, lie for the most part,
          not in the real present, but merely in abstract thoughts. It is
          these which are often unbearable to us—inflict torments in
          comparison with which all the sufferings of the animal world are
          very small; for even our own physical pain is not felt at all when
          they are present. Indeed, in the case of keen mental suffering, we
          even inflict physical suffering on ourselves merely to distract our
          attention from the former to the latter. This is why, in great
          mental anguish, men tear their hair, beat their breasts, lacerate
          their faces, or roll on the floor, for all these are in reality
          only violent means of diverting the mind from an unbearable
          thought. Just because mental pain, being much greater, makes us
          insensible to physical pain, suicide is very easy to the person who
          is in despair, or who is consumed by morbid depression, even though
          formerly, in comfortable circumstances, he recoiled at the thought
          of it. In the same way care and passion (thus the play of thought)
          wear out the body oftener and more than physical hardships. And in
          accordance with this Epictetus rightly says: Ταρασσει τους
          ανθρωπους ου τα πραγματα, αλλα τα περι των πραγματων δογματα
          (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Perturbant homines non res ipsæ, sed de rebus
          decreta</span></span>) (V.); and Seneca: <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Plura sunt quæ nos terrent, quam quæ premunt,
          et sæpius opinione quam re laboramus</span></span> (Ep. 5).
          Eulenspiegel also admirably bantered human nature, for going uphill
          he laughed, and going downhill he wept. Indeed, children who have
          hurt themselves often cry, not at the pain, but at the thought of
          the pain which is awakened when some one condoles with them. Such
          great differences in conduct and in life arise from the diversity
          between the methods of knowledge of the brutes and man. Further,
          the appearance of the distinct and decided individual character,
          the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page387">[pg 387]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg387"></a> principal
          distinction between man and the brute, which has scarcely more than
          the character of the species, is conditioned by the choice between
          several motives, which is only possible through abstract
          conceptions. For only after a choice has been made are the
          resolutions, which vary in different individuals, an indication of
          the individual character which is different in each; while the
          action of the brute depends only upon the presence or absence of
          the impression, supposing this impression to be in general a motive
          for its species. And, finally, in the case of man, only the
          resolve, and not the mere wish, is a valid indication of his
          character both for himself and for others; but the resolve becomes
          for himself, as for others, a certain fact only through the deed.
          The wish is merely the necessary consequence of the present
          impression, whether of the outward stimulus, or the inward passing
          mood; and is therefore as immediately necessary and devoid of
          consideration as the action of the brutes. Therefore, like the
          action of the brutes, it merely expresses the character of the
          species, not that of the individual, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          it indicates merely what <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">man in general</span></em>, not what the
          individual who experiences the wish, is capable of doing. The deed
          alone,—because as human action it always requires a certain
          deliberation, and because as a rule a man has command of his
          reason, is considerate, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, decides in accordance with
          considered and abstract motives,—is the expression of the
          intelligible maxims of his conduct, the result of his inmost
          willing, and is related as a letter to the word that stands for his
          empirical character, itself merely the temporal expression of his
          intelligible character. In a healthy mind, therefore, only deeds
          oppress the conscience, not wishes and thoughts; for it is only our
          deeds that hold up to us the mirror of our will. The deed referred
          to above, that is entirely unconsidered and is really committed in
          blind passion, is to a certain extent an intermediate thing between
          the mere wish and the resolve.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page388">[pg 388]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg388"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Therefore, by
          true repentance, which, however, shows itself as action also, it
          can be obliterated, as a falsely drawn line, from that picture of
          our will which our course of life is. I may insert the remark here,
          as a very good comparison, that the relation between wish and deed
          has a purely accidental but accurate analogy with that between the
          accumulation and discharge of electricity.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As the result of
          the whole of this discussion of the freedom of the will and what
          relates to it, we find that although the will may, in itself and
          apart from the phenomenon, be called free and even omnipotent, yet
          in its particular phenomena enlightened by knowledge, as in men and
          brutes, it is determined by motives to which the special character
          regularly and necessarily responds, and always in the same way. We
          see that because of the possession on his part of abstract or
          rational knowledge, man, as distinguished from the brutes, has a
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">choice</span></em>, which only makes him the
          scene of the conflict of his motives, without withdrawing him from
          their control. This choice is therefore certainly the condition of
          the possibility of the complete expression of the individual
          character, but is by no means to be regarded as freedom of the
          particular volition, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, independence of the law of
          causality, the necessity of which extends to man as to every other
          phenomenon. Thus the difference between human volition and that of
          the brutes, which is introduced by reason or knowledge through
          concepts, extends to the point we have indicated, and no farther.
          But, what is quite a different thing, there may arise a phenomenon
          of the human will which is quite impossible in the brute creation,
          if man altogether lays aside the knowledge of particular things as
          such which is subordinate to the principle of sufficient reason,
          and by means of his knowledge of the Ideas sees through the
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium individuationis</span></span>. Then
          an actual appearance of the real freedom of the will as a
          thing-in-itself is possible, by which the phenomenon comes into a
          sort of contradiction with <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page389">[pg 389]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg389"></a> itself, as is indicated by the word
          self-renunciation; and, finally, the <span class="tei tei-q">“in-itself”</span> of its nature suppresses itself. But
          this, the one, real, and direct expression of the freedom of the
          will in itself in the phenomenon, cannot be distinctly explained
          here, but will form the subject of the concluding part of our
          work.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now that we have
          shown clearly in these pages the unalterable nature of the
          empirical character, which is just the unfolding of the
          intelligible character that lies outside time, together with the
          necessity with which actions follow upon its contact with motives,
          we hasten to anticipate an argument which may very easily be drawn
          from this in the interest of bad dispositions. Our character is to
          be regarded as the temporal unfolding of an extra-temporal, and
          therefore indivisible and unalterable, act of will, or an
          intelligible character. This necessarily determines all that is
          essential in our conduct in life, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          its ethical content, which must express itself in accordance with
          it in its phenomenal appearance, the empirical character; while
          only what is unessential in this, the outward form of our course of
          life, depends upon the forms in which the motives present
          themselves. It might, therefore, be inferred that it is a waste of
          trouble to endeavour to improve one's character, and that it is
          wiser to submit to the inevitable, and gratify every inclination at
          once, even if it is bad. But this is precisely the same thing as
          the theory of an inevitable fate which is called αργος λογος, and
          in more recent times Turkish faith. Its true refutation, as it is
          supposed to have been given by Chrysippus, is explained by Cicero
          in his book <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De Fato</span></span>, ch. 12, 13.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Though
          everything may be regarded as irrevocably predetermined by fate,
          yet it is so only through the medium of the chain of causes;
          therefore in no case can it be determined that an effect shall
          appear without its cause. Thus it is not simply the event that is
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page390">[pg 390]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg390"></a> predetermined, but
          the event as the consequence of preceding causes; so that fate does
          not decide the consequence alone, but also the means as the
          consequence of which it is destined to appear. Accordingly, if some
          means is not present, it is certain that the consequence also will
          not be present: each is always present in accordance with the
          determination of fate, but this is never known to us till
          afterwards.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As events always
          take place according to fate, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, according to the infinite
          concatenation of causes, so our actions always take place according
          to our intelligible character. But just as we do not know the
          former beforehand, so no <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          priori</span></span> insight is given us into the latter, but we
          only come to know ourselves as we come to know other persons
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a posteriori</span></span> through experience.
          If the intelligible character involved that we could only form a
          good resolution after a long conflict with a bad disposition, this
          conflict would have to come first and be waited for. Reflection on
          the unalterable nature of the character, on the unity of the source
          from which all our actions flow, must not mislead us into claiming
          the decision of the character in favour of one side or the other;
          it is in the resolve that follows that we shall see what manner of
          men we are, and mirror ourselves in our actions. This is the
          explanation of the satisfaction or the anguish of soul with which
          we look back on the course of our past life. Both are experienced,
          not because these past deeds have still an existence; they are
          past, they have been, and now are no more; but their great
          importance for us lies in their significance, lies in the fact that
          these deeds are the expression of the character, the mirror of the
          will, in which we look and recognise our inmost self, the kernel of
          our will. Because we experience this not before, but only after, it
          behoves us to strive and fight in time, in order that the picture
          we produce by our deeds may be such that the contemplation of it
          may calm us as much as possible, instead of harassing us. The
          significance of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page391">[pg
          391]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg391"></a>
          this consolation or anguish of soul will, as we have said, be
          inquired into farther on; but to this place there belongs the
          inquiry which follows, and which stands by itself.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Besides the
          intelligible and the empirical character, we must mention a third
          which is different from them both, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">acquired
          character</span></em>, which one only receives in life through
          contact with the world, and which is referred to when one is
          praised as a man of character or censured as being without
          character. Certainly one might suppose that, since the empirical
          character, as the phenomenon of the intelligible, is unalterable,
          and, like every natural phenomenon, is consistent with itself, man
          would always have to appear like himself and consistent, and would
          therefore have no need to acquire a character artificially by
          experience and reflection. But the case is otherwise, and although
          a man is always the same, yet he does not always understand
          himself, but often mistakes himself, till he has in some degree
          acquired real self-knowledge. The empirical character, as a mere
          natural tendency, is in itself irrational; nay, more, its
          expressions are disturbed by reason, all the more so the more
          intellect and power of thought the man has; for these always keep
          before him what becomes <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">man in general</span></em> as the character of
          the species, and what is possible for him both in will and in deed.
          This makes it the more difficult for him to see how much his
          individuality enables him to will and to accomplish. He finds in
          himself the germs of all the various human pursuits and powers, but
          the difference of degree in which they exist in his individuality
          is not clear to him in the absence of experience; and if he now
          applies himself to the pursuits which alone correspond to his
          character, he yet feels, especially at particular moments and in
          particular moods, the inclination to directly opposite pursuits
          which cannot be combined with them, but must be entirely suppressed
          if he desires to follow the former undisturbed. For as our physical
          path upon earth is always <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page392">[pg
          392]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg392"></a>
          merely a line, not an extended surface, so in life, if we desire to
          grasp and possess one thing, we must renounce and leave innumerable
          others on the right hand and on the left. If we cannot make up our
          minds to this, but, like children at the fair, snatch at everything
          that attracts us in passing, we are making the perverse endeavour
          to change the line of our path into an extended surface; we run in
          a zigzag, skip about like a will o' the wisp, and attain to
          nothing. Or, to use another comparison, as, according to Hobbes'
          philosophy of law, every one has an original right to everything
          but an exclusive right to nothing, yet can obtain an exclusive
          right to particular things by renouncing his right to all the rest,
          while others, on their part, do likewise with regard to what he has
          chosen; so is it in life, in which some definite pursuit, whether
          it be pleasure, honour, wealth, science, art, or virtue, can only
          be followed with seriousness and success when all claims that are
          foreign to it are given up, when everything else is renounced.
          Accordingly, the mere will and the mere ability are not sufficient,
          but a man must also <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">know</span></em> what he wills, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">know</span></em>
          what he can do; only then will he show character, and only then can
          he accomplish something right. Until he attains to that,
          notwithstanding the natural consistency of the empirical character,
          he is without character. And although, on the whole, he must remain
          true to himself, and fulfil his course, led by his dæmon, yet his
          path will not be a straight line, but wavering and uneven. He will
          hesitate, deviate, turn back, lay up for himself repentance and
          pain. And all this is because, in great and small, he sees before
          him all that is possible and attainable for man in general, but
          does not know what part of all this is alone suitable for him, can
          be accomplished by him, and is alone enjoyable by him. He will,
          therefore, envy many men on account of a position and circumstances
          which are yet only suitable to their characters and not to his, and
          in which he would feel unhappy, if indeed he found <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page393">[pg 393]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg393"></a> them endurable at all. For as a fish is
          only at home in water, a bird in the air, a mole in the earth, so
          every man is only at home in the atmosphere suitable to him. For
          example, not all men can breathe the air of court life. From
          deficiency of proper insight into all this, many a man will make
          all kinds of abortive attempts, will do violence to his character
          in particulars, and yet, on the whole, will have to yield to it
          again; and what he thus painfully attains will give him no
          pleasure; what he thus learns will remain dead; even in an ethical
          regard, a deed that is too noble for his character, that has not
          sprung from pure, direct impulse, but from a concept, a dogma, will
          lose all merit, even in his own eyes, through subsequent egoistical
          repentance. <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Velle non
          discitur.</span></span> We only become conscious of the
          inflexibility of another person's character through experience, and
          till then we childishly believe that it is possible, by means of
          rational ideas, by prayers and entreaties, by example and
          noble-mindedness, ever to persuade any one to leave his own way, to
          change his course of conduct, to depart from his mode of thinking,
          or even to extend his capacities: so is it also with ourselves. We
          must first learn from experience what we desire and what we can do.
          Till then we know it not, we are without character, and must often
          be driven back to our own way by hard blows from without. But if we
          have finally learnt it, then we have attained to what in the world
          is called character, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">acquired character</span></em>. This is
          accordingly nothing but the most perfect knowledge possible of our
          own individuality. It is the abstract, and consequently distinct,
          knowledge of the unalterable qualities of our own empirical
          character, and of the measure and direction of our mental and
          physical powers, and thus of the whole strength and weakness of our
          own individuality. This places us in a position to carry out
          deliberately and methodically the rôle which belongs to our own
          person, and to fill up the gaps which caprices or weaknesses
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page394">[pg 394]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg394"></a> produce in it, under
          the guidance of fixed conceptions. This rôle is in itself
          unchangeably determined once for all, but hitherto we have allowed
          it to follow its natural course without any rule. We have now
          brought to distinct conscious maxims which are always present to us
          the form of conduct which is necessarily determined by our own
          individual nature, and now we conduct it in accordance with them as
          deliberately as if we had learned it; without ever falling into
          error through the passing influence of the mood or the impression
          of the present, without being checked by the bitterness or
          sweetness of some particular thing we meet with on our path,
          without delay, without hesitation, without inconsistency. We shall
          now no longer, as novices, wait, attempt, and grope about in order
          to see what we really desire and are able to do, but we know this
          once for all, and in every choice we have only to apply general
          principles to particular cases, and arrive at once at a decision.
          We know our will in general, and do not allow ourselves to be led
          by the passing mood or by solicitations from without to resolve in
          particular cases what is contrary to it as a whole. We know in the
          same way the nature and the measure of our strength and our
          weakness, and thereby are spared much suffering. For we experience
          no real pleasure except in the use and feeling of our own powers,
          and the greatest pain is the conscious deficiency of our powers
          where we need them. If, now, we have discovered where our strength
          and our weakness lie, we will endeavour to cultivate, employ, and
          in every way make use of those talents which are naturally
          prominent in us. We will always turn to those occupations in which
          they are valuable and to the purpose, and entirely avoid, even with
          self-renunciation, those pursuits for which we have naturally
          little aptitude; we will beware of attempting that in which we have
          no chance of succeeding. Only he who has attained to this will
          constantly and with <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page395">[pg
          395]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg395"></a>
          full consciousness be completely himself, and will never fail
          himself at the critical moment, because he will always have known
          what he could expect from himself. He will often enjoy the
          satisfaction of feeling his strength, and seldom experience the
          pain of being reminded of his weakness. The latter is
          mortification, which causes perhaps the greatest of mental
          sufferings; therefore it is far more endurable to have our
          misfortune brought clearly before us than our incapacity. And,
          further, if we are thus fully acquainted with our strength and our
          weakness, we will not attempt to make a show of powers which we do
          not possess; we will not play with base coin, for all such
          dissimulation misses the mark in the end. For since the whole man
          is only the phenomenon of his will, nothing can be more perverse
          than to try, by means of reflection, to become something else than
          one is, for this is a direct contradiction of the will with itself.
          The imitation of the qualities and idiosyncrasies of others is much
          more shameful than to dress in other people's clothes; for it is
          the judgment of our own worthlessness pronounced by ourselves.
          Knowledge of our own mind and its capacities of every kind, and
          their unalterable limits, is in this respect the surest way to the
          attainment of the greatest possible contentment with ourselves. For
          it holds good of inward as of outward circumstances that there is
          for us no consolation so effective as the complete certainty of
          unalterable necessity. No evil that befalls us pains us so much as
          the thought of the circumstances by which it might have been warded
          off. Therefore nothing comforts us so effectually as the
          consideration of what has happened from the standpoint of
          necessity, from which all accidents appear as tools in the hand of
          an overruling fate, and we therefore recognise the evil that has
          come to us as inevitably produced by the conflict of inner and
          outer circumstances; in other words, fatalism. We really only
          complain and storm so long as we hope <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page396">[pg 396]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg396"></a> either to affect others or to excite
          ourselves to unheard-of efforts. But children and grown-up people
          know very well to yield contentedly as soon as they clearly see
          that it absolutely cannot be otherwise:—Θυμὸν ἐνὶ στήθεσσι φίλον
          δαμάσσαντες ἀνάγκη (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Animo in pectoribus
          nostro domito necessitate</span></span>). We are like the entrapped
          elephants, that rage and struggle for many days, till they see that
          it is useless, and then suddenly offer their necks quietly to the
          yoke, tamed for ever. We are like King David, who, as long as his
          son still lived, unceasingly importuned Jehovah with prayers, and
          behaved himself as if in despair; but as soon as his son was dead,
          thought no longer about it. Hence it arises that innumerable
          permanent ills, such as lameness, poverty, low estate, ugliness, a
          disagreeable dwelling-place, are borne with indifference by
          innumerable persons, and are no longer felt, like healed wounds,
          just because these persons know that inward or outward necessity
          renders it impossible that any change can take place in these
          things; while those who are more fortunate cannot understand how
          such misfortunes can be borne. Now as with outward necessity, so
          also with inward; nothing reconciles so thoroughly as a distinct
          knowledge of it. If we have once for all distinctly recognised not
          only our good qualities and our strength, but also our defects and
          weakness, established our aim accordingly, and rest satisfied
          concerning what cannot be attained, we thus escape in the surest
          way, as far as our individuality permits, the bitterest of all
          sorrows, discontentment with ourselves, which is the inevitable
          result of ignorance of our own individuality, of false conceit and
          the audacity that proceeds from it. To the bitter chapter of the
          self-knowledge here recommended the lines of Ovid admit of
          excellent application—</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So much with
          regard to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">acquired character</span></em>, which, indeed,
          is not of so much importance for ethics proper as for life in the
          world. But its investigation was related as that of a third species
          to the investigation of the intelligible and the empirical
          character, in regard to which we were obliged to enter upon a
          somewhat detailed inquiry in order to bring out clearly how in all
          its phenomena the will is subject to necessity, while yet in itself
          it may be called free and even omnipotent.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 56. This
          freedom, this omnipotence, as the expression of which the whole
          visible world exists and progressively develops in accordance with
          the laws which belong to the form of knowledge, can now, at the
          point at which in its most perfect manifestation it has attained to
          the completely adequate knowledge of its own nature, express itself
          anew in two ways. Either it wills here, at the summit of mental
          endowment and self-consciousness, simply what it willed before
          blindly and unconsciously, and if so, knowledge always remains its
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">motive</span></em> in the whole as in the
          particular case. Or, conversely, this knowledge becomes for it a
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">quieter</span></em>, which appeases and
          suppresses all willing. This is that assertion and denial of the
          will to live which was stated above in general terms. As, in the
          reference of individual conduct, a general, not a particular
          manifestation of will, it does not disturb and modify the
          development of the character, nor does it find its expression in
          particular actions; but, either by an ever more marked appearance
          of the whole method of action it has followed hitherto, or
          conversely by the entire suppression of it, it expresses in a
          living form the maxims which the will has freely adopted in
          accordance with the knowledge it has now attained to. By the
          explanations we have just given of freedom, necessity, and
          character, we have somewhat facilitated and prepared the way for
          the clearer development of all this, which is the principal subject
          of this last book. But we shall have done so still more when we
          have turned our attention to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page398">[pg 398]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg398"></a> life itself, the willing or not willing of
          which is the great question, and have endeavoured to find out
          generally what the will itself, which is everywhere the inmost
          nature of this life, will really attain by its assertion—in what
          way and to what extent this assertion satisfies or can satisfy the
          will; in short, what is generally and mainly to be regarded as its
          position in this its own world, which in every relation belongs to
          it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">First of all, I
          wish the reader to recall the passage with which we closed the
          Second Book,—a passage occasioned by the question, which met us
          then, as to the end and aim of the will. Instead of the answer to
          this question, it appeared clearly before us how, in all the grades
          of its manifestation, from the lowest to the highest, the will
          dispenses altogether with a final goal and aim. It always strives,
          for striving is its sole nature, which no attained goal can put an
          end to. Therefore it is not susceptible of any final satisfaction,
          but can only be restrained by hindrances, while in itself it goes
          on for ever. We see this in the simplest of all natural phenomena,
          gravity, which does not cease to strive and press towards a
          mathematical centre to reach which would be the annihilation both
          of itself and matter, and would not cease even if the whole
          universe were already rolled into one ball. We see it in the other
          simple natural phenomena. A solid tends towards fluidity either by
          melting or dissolving, for only so will its chemical forces be
          free; rigidity is the imprisonment in which it is held by cold. The
          fluid tends towards the gaseous state, into which it passes at once
          as soon as all pressure is removed from it. No body is without
          relationship, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, without tendency or
          without desire and longing, as Jacob Böhme would say. Electricity
          transmits its inner self-repulsion to infinity, though the mass of
          the earth absorbs the effect. Galvanism is certainly, so long as
          the pile is working, an aimless, unceasingly repeated act of
          repulsion and attraction. The existence of the plant is just such a
          restless, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page399">[pg
          399]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg399"></a>
          never satisfied striving, a ceaseless tendency through
          ever-ascending forms, till the end, the seed, becomes a new
          starting-point; and this repeated <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ad
          infinitum</span></span>—nowhere an end, nowhere a final
          satisfaction, nowhere a resting-place. It will also be remembered,
          from the Second Book, that the multitude of natural forces and
          organised forms everywhere strive with each other for the matter in
          which they desire to appear, for each of them only possesses what
          it has wrested from the others; and thus a constant internecine war
          is waged, from which, for the most part, arises the resistance
          through which that striving, which constitutes the inner nature of
          everything, is at all points hindered; struggles in vain, yet, from
          its nature, cannot leave off; toils on laboriously till this
          phenomenon dies, when others eagerly seize its place and its
          matter.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have long
          since recognised this striving, which constitutes the kernel and
          in-itself of everything, as identical with that which in us, where
          it manifests itself most distinctly in the light of the fullest
          consciousness, is called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em>. Its hindrance through an
          obstacle which places itself between it and its temporary aim we
          call <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">suffering</span></em>, and, on the other hand,
          its attainment of the end satisfaction, wellbeing, happiness. We
          may also transfer this terminology to the phenomena of the
          unconscious world, for though weaker in degree, they are identical
          in nature. Then we see them involved in constant suffering, and
          without any continuing happiness. For all effort springs from
          defect—from discontent with one's estate—is thus suffering so long
          as it is not satisfied; but no satisfaction is lasting, rather it
          is always merely the starting-point of a new effort. The striving
          we see everywhere hindered in many ways, everywhere in conflict,
          and therefore always under the form of suffering. Thus, if there is
          no final end of striving, there is no measure and end of
          suffering.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But what we only
          discover in unconscious Nature by sharpened observation, and with
          an effort, presents itself <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page400">[pg 400]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg400"></a> distinctly to us in the intelligent world in
          the life of animals, whose constant suffering is easily proved. But
          without lingering over these intermediate grades, we shall turn to
          the life of man, in which all this appears with the greatest
          distinctness, illuminated by the clearest knowledge; for as the
          phenomenon of will becomes more complete, the suffering also
          becomes more and more apparent. In the plant there is as yet no
          sensibility, and therefore no pain. A certain very small degree of
          suffering is experienced by the lowest species of animal
          life—infusoria and radiata; even in insects the capacity to feel
          and suffer is still limited. It first appears in a high degree with
          the complete nervous system of vertebrate animals, and always in a
          higher degree the more intelligence develops. Thus, in proportion
          as knowledge attains to distinctness, as consciousness ascends,
          pain also increases, and therefore reaches its highest degree in
          man. And then, again, the more distinctly a man knows, the more
          intelligent he is, the more pain he has; the man who is gifted with
          genius suffers most of all. In this sense, that is, with reference
          to the degree of knowledge in general, not mere abstract rational
          knowledge, I understand and use here that saying of the Preacher:
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Qui auget scientiam, auget at
          dolorem.</span></span> That philosophical painter or painting
          philosopher, Tischbein, has very beautifully expressed the accurate
          relation between the degree of consciousness and that of suffering
          by exhibiting it in a visible and clear form in a drawing. The
          upper half of his drawing represents women whose children have been
          stolen, and who in different groups and attitudes, express in many
          ways deep maternal pain, anguish, and despair. The lower half of
          the drawing represents sheep whose lambs have been taken away. They
          are arranged and grouped in precisely the same way; so that every
          human head, every human attitude of the upper half, has below a
          brute head and attitude corresponding to it. Thus we see distinctly
          how the pain which is possible in the dull brute consciousness
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page401">[pg 401]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg401"></a> is related to the
          violent grief, which only becomes possible through distinctness of
          knowledge and clearness of consciousness.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We desire to
          consider in this way, in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">human existence</span></em>, the inner and
          essential destiny of will. Every one will easily recognise that
          same destiny expressed in various degrees in the life of the
          brutes, only more weakly, and may also convince himself to his own
          satisfaction, from the suffering animal world, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">how essential to
          all life is suffering</span></em>.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 57. At every
          grade that is enlightened by knowledge, the will appears as an
          individual. The human individual finds himself as finite in
          infinite space and time, and consequently as a vanishing quantity
          compared with them. He is projected into them, and, on account of
          their unlimited nature, he has always a merely relative, never
          absolute <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">when</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">where</span></em>
          of his existence; for his place and duration are finite parts of
          what is infinite and boundless. His real existence is only in the
          present, whose unchecked flight into the past is a constant
          transition into death, a constant dying. For his past life, apart
          from its possible consequences for the present, and the testimony
          regarding the will that is expressed in it, is now entirely done
          with, dead, and no longer anything; and, therefore, it must be, as
          a matter of reason, indifferent to him whether the content of that
          past was pain or pleasure. But the present is always passing
          through his hands into the past; the future is quite uncertain and
          always short. Thus his existence, even when we consider only its
          formal side, is a constant hurrying of the present into the dead
          past, a constant dying. But if we look at it from the physical
          side; it is clear that, as our walking is admittedly merely a
          constantly prevented falling, the life of our body is only a
          constantly prevented dying, an ever-postponed death: finally, in
          the same way, the activity of our mind is a constantly deferred
          ennui. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page402">[pg
          402]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg402"></a>
          Every breath we draw wards off the death that is constantly
          intruding upon us. In this way we fight with it every moment, and
          again, at longer intervals, through every meal we eat, every sleep
          we take, every time we warm ourselves, &amp;c. In the end, death
          must conquer, for we became subject to him through birth, and he
          only plays for a little while with his prey before he swallows it
          up. We pursue our life, however, with great interest and much
          solicitude as long as possible, as we blow out a soap-bubble as
          long and as large as possible, although we know perfectly well that
          it will burst.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We saw that the
          inner being of unconscious nature is a constant striving without
          end and without rest. And this appears to us much more distinctly
          when we consider the nature of brutes and man. Willing and striving
          is its whole being, which may be very well compared to an
          unquenchable thirst. But the basis of all willing is need,
          deficiency, and thus pain. Consequently, the nature of brutes and
          man is subject to pain originally and through its very being. If,
          on the other hand, it lacks objects of desire, because it is at
          once deprived of them by a too easy satisfaction, a terrible void
          and ennui comes over it, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, its being and existence
          itself becomes an unbearable burden to it. Thus its life swings
          like a pendulum backwards and forwards between pain and ennui. This
          has also had to express itself very oddly in this way; after man
          had transferred all pain and torments to hell, there then remained
          nothing over for heaven but ennui.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the constant
          striving which constitutes the inner nature of every manifestation
          of will obtains its primary and most general foundation at the
          higher grades of objectification, from the fact that here the will
          manifests itself as a living body, with the iron command to nourish
          it; and what gives strength to this command is just that this body
          is nothing but the objectified will to live <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page403">[pg 403]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg403"></a> itself. Man, as the most complete
          objectification of that will, is in like measure also the most
          necessitous of all beings: he is through and through concrete
          willing and needing; he is a concretion of a thousand necessities.
          With these he stands upon the earth, left to himself, uncertain
          about everything except his own need and misery. Consequently the
          care for the maintenance of that existence under exacting demands,
          which are renewed every day, occupies, as a rule, the whole of
          human life. To this is directly related the second claim, that of
          the propagation of the species. At the same time he is threatened
          from all sides by the most different kinds of dangers, from which
          it requires constant watchfulness to escape. With cautious steps
          and casting anxious glances round him he pursues his path, for a
          thousand accidents and a thousand enemies lie in wait for him. Thus
          he went while yet a savage, thus he goes in civilised life; there
          is no security for him.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The life of the
          great majority is only a constant struggle for this existence
          itself, with the certainty of losing it at last. But what enables
          them to endure this wearisome battle is not so much the love of
          life as the fear of death, which yet stands in the background as
          inevitable, and may come upon them at any moment. Life itself is a
          sea, full of rocks and whirlpools, which man avoids with the
          greatest care and solicitude, although he knows that even if he
          succeeds in getting through with all his efforts and skill, he yet
          by doing so comes nearer at every step to the greatest, the total,
          inevitable, and irremediable shipwreck, death; nay, even steers
          right upon it: this is the final goal of the laborious voyage, and
          worse for him than all the rocks from which he has escaped.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now it is well
          worth observing that, on the one hand, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page404">[pg 404]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg404"></a> the suffering and misery of life may easily
          increase to such an extent that death itself, in the flight from
          which the whole of life consists, becomes desirable, and we hasten
          towards it voluntarily; and again, on the other hand, that as soon
          as want and suffering permit rest to a man, ennui is at once so
          near that he necessarily requires diversion. The striving after
          existence is what occupies all living things and maintains them in
          motion. But when existence is assured, then they know not what to
          do with it; thus the second thing that sets them in motion is the
          effort to get free from the burden of existence, to make it cease
          to be felt, <span class="tei tei-q">“to kill time,”</span>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, to escape from ennui.
          Accordingly we see that almost all men who are secure from want and
          care, now that at last they have thrown off all other burdens,
          become a burden to themselves, and regard as a gain every hour they
          succeed in getting through; and thus every diminution of the very
          life which, till then, they have employed all their powers to
          maintain as long as possible. Ennui is by no means an evil to be
          lightly esteemed; in the end it depicts on the countenance real
          despair. It makes beings who love each other so little as men do,
          seek each other eagerly, and thus becomes the source of social
          intercourse. Moreover, even from motives of policy, public
          precautions are everywhere taken against it, as against other
          universal calamities. For this evil may drive men to the greatest
          excesses, just as much as its opposite extreme, famine: the people
          require <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">panem et
          circenses</span></span>. The strict penitentiary system of
          Philadelphia makes use of ennui alone as a means of punishment,
          through solitary confinement and idleness, and it is found so
          terrible that it has even led prisoners to commit suicide. As want
          is the constant scourge of the people, so ennui is that of the
          fashionable world. In middle-class life ennui is represented by the
          Sunday, and want by the six week-days.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus between
          desiring and attaining all human life flows on throughout. The wish
          is, in its nature, pain; <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page405">[pg
          405]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg405"></a>
          the attainment soon begets satiety: the end was only apparent;
          possession takes away the charm; the wish, the need, presents
          itself under a new form; when it does not, then follows
          desolateness, emptiness, ennui, against which the conflict is just
          as painful as against want. That wish and satisfaction should
          follow each other neither too quickly nor too slowly reduces the
          suffering, which both occasion to the smallest amount, and
          constitutes the happiest life. For that which we might otherwise
          call the most beautiful part of life, its purest joy, if it were
          only because it lifts us out of real existence and transforms us
          into disinterested spectators of it—that is, pure knowledge, which
          is foreign to all willing, the pleasure of the beautiful, the true
          delight in art—this is granted only to a very few, because it
          demands rare talents, and to these few only as a passing dream. And
          then, even these few, on account of their higher intellectual
          power, are made susceptible of far greater suffering than duller
          minds can ever feel, and are also placed in lonely isolation by a
          nature which is obviously different from that of others; thus here
          also accounts are squared. But to the great majority of men purely
          intellectual pleasures are not accessible. They are almost quite
          incapable of the joys which lie in pure knowledge. They are
          entirely given up to willing. If, therefore, anything is to win
          their sympathy, to be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">interesting</span></em> to them, it must (as
          is implied in the meaning of the word) in some way excite their
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em>, even if it is only through a
          distant and merely problematical relation to it; the will must not
          be left altogether out of the question, for their existence lies
          far more in willing than in knowing,—action and reaction is their
          one element. We may find in trifles and everyday occurrences the
          naïve expressions of this quality. Thus, for example, at any place
          worth seeing they may visit, they write their names, in order thus
          to react, to affect the place since it does not affect them. Again,
          when they see a strange rare animal, they cannot <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page406">[pg 406]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg406"></a> easily confine themselves to merely
          observing it; they must rouse it, tease it, play with it, merely to
          experience action and reaction; but this need for excitement of the
          will manifests itself very specially in the discovery and support
          of card-playing, which is quite peculiarly the expression of the
          miserable side of humanity.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But whatever
          nature and fortune may have done, whoever a man be and whatever he
          may possess, the pain which is essential to life cannot be thrown
          off:—Πηλειδης δ᾽ ῳμωξεν, ιδων εις ουρανον ευρυν (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Pelides autem ejulavit, intuitus in cælum
          latum</span></span>). And again:—Ζηνος μεν παις ηα Κρονιονος, αυταρ
          οιζυν ειχον απειρεσιην (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Jovis quidem filius
          eram Saturnii; verum ærumnam habebam infinitam</span></span>). The
          ceaseless efforts to banish suffering accomplish no more than to
          make it change its form. It is essentially deficiency, want, care
          for the maintenance of life. If we succeed, which is very
          difficult, in removing pain in this form, it immediately assumes a
          thousand others, varying according to age and circumstances, such
          as lust, passionate love, jealousy, envy, hatred, anxiety,
          ambition, covetousness, sickness, &amp;c., &amp;c. If at last it
          can find entrance in no other form, it comes in the sad, grey
          garments of tediousness and ennui, against which we then strive in
          various ways. If finally we succeed in driving this away, we shall
          hardly do so without letting pain enter in one of its earlier
          forms, and the dance begin again from the beginning; for all human
          life is tossed backwards and forwards between pain and ennui.
          Depressing as this view of life is, I will draw attention, by the
          way, to an aspect of it from which consolation may be drawn, and
          perhaps even a stoical indifference to one's own present ills may
          be attained. For our impatience at these arises for the most part
          from the fact that we regard them as brought about by a chain of
          causes which might easily be different. We do not generally grieve
          over ills which are directly necessary and quite universal; for
          example, the necessity of age and of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page407">[pg 407]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg407"></a> death, and many daily inconveniences. It is
          rather the consideration of the accidental nature of the
          circumstances that brought some sorrow just to us, that gives it
          its sting. But if we have recognised that pain, as such, is
          inevitable and essential to life, and that nothing depends upon
          chance but its mere fashion, the form under which it presents
          itself, that thus our present sorrow fills a place that, without
          it, would at once be occupied by another which now is excluded by
          it, and that therefore fate can affect us little in what is
          essential; such a reflection, if it were to become a living
          conviction, might produce a considerable degree of stoical
          equanimity, and very much lessen the anxious care for our own
          well-being. But, in fact, such a powerful control of reason over
          directly felt suffering seldom or never occurs.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Besides, through
          this view of the inevitableness of pain, of the supplanting of one
          pain by another, and the introduction of a new pain through the
          passing away of that which preceded it, one might be led to the
          paradoxical but not absurd hypothesis, that in every individual the
          measure of the pain essential to him was determined once for all by
          his nature, a measure which could neither remain empty, nor be more
          than filled, however much the form of the suffering might change.
          Thus his suffering and well-being would by no means be determined
          from without, but only through that measure, that natural
          disposition, which indeed might experience certain additions and
          diminutions from the physical condition at different times, but
          yet, on the whole, would remain the same, and would just be what is
          called the temperament, or, more accurately, the degree in which he
          might be ευκολος or δυσκολος, as Plato expresses it in the First
          Book of the Republic, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, in an easy or difficult
          mood. This hypothesis is supported not only by the well-known
          experience that great suffering makes all lesser ills cease to be
          felt, and conversely that freedom from great suffering makes even
          the most trifling inconveniences torment us <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page408">[pg 408]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg408"></a> and put us out of humour; but
          experience also teaches that if a great misfortune, at the mere
          thought of which we shuddered, actually befalls us, as soon as we
          have overcome the first pain of it, our disposition remains for the
          most part unchanged; and, conversely, that after the attainment of
          some happiness we have long desired, we do not feel ourselves on
          the whole and permanently very much better off and agreeably
          situated than before. Only the moment at which these changes occur
          affects us with unusual strength, as deep sorrow or exulting joy,
          but both soon pass away, for they are based upon illusion. For they
          do not spring from the immediately present pleasure or pain, but
          only from the opening up of a new future which is anticipated in
          them. Only by borrowing from the future could pain or pleasure be
          heightened so abnormally, and consequently not enduringly. It would
          follow, from the hypothesis advanced, that a large part of the
          feeling of suffering and of well-being would be subjective and
          determined <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span>, as is
          the case with knowing; and we may add the following remarks as
          evidence in favour of it. Human cheerfulness or dejection are
          manifestly not determined by external circumstances, such as wealth
          and position, for we see at least as many glad faces among the poor
          as among the rich. Further, the motives which induce suicide are so
          very different, that we can assign no motive that is so great as to
          bring it about, even with great probability, in every character,
          and few that would be so small that the like of them had never
          caused it. Now although the degree of our serenity or sadness is
          not at all times the same, yet, in consequence of this view, we
          shall not attribute it to the change of outward circumstances, but
          to that of the inner condition, the physical state. For when an
          actual, though only temporary, increase of our serenity, even to
          the extent of joyfulness, takes place, it usually appears without
          any external occasion. It is true that <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page409">[pg 409]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg409"></a> we often see our pain arise only from some
          definite external relation, and are visibly oppressed and saddened
          by this only. Then we believe that if only this were taken away,
          the greatest contentment would necessarily ensue. But this is
          illusion. The measure of our pain and our happiness is on the
          whole, according to our hypothesis, subjectively determined for
          each point of time, and the motive for sadness is related to that,
          just as a blister which draws to a head all the bad humours
          otherwise distributed is related to the body. The pain which is at
          that period of time essential to our nature, and therefore cannot
          be shaken off, would, without the definite external cause of our
          suffering, be divided at a hundred points, and appear in the form
          of a hundred little annoyances and cares about things which we now
          entirely overlook, because our capacity for pain is already filled
          by that chief evil which has concentrated in a point all the
          suffering otherwise dispersed. This corresponds also to the
          observation that if a great and pressing care is lifted from our
          breast by its fortunate issue, another immediately takes its place,
          the whole material of which was already there before, yet could not
          come into consciousness as care because there was no capacity left
          for it, and therefore this material of care remained indistinct and
          unobserved in a cloudy form on the farthest horizon of
          consciousness. But now that there is room, this prepared material
          at once comes forward and occupies the throne of the reigning care
          of the day (πρυτανευουσα). And if it is very much lighter in its
          matter than the material of the care which has vanished, it knows
          how to blow itself out so as apparently to equal it in size, and
          thus, as the chief care of the day, completely fills the
          throne.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Excessive joy
          and very keen suffering always occur in the same person, for they
          condition each other reciprocally, and are also in common
          conditioned by great activity of the mind. Both are produced, as we
          have just seen, not by what is really present, but by the
          anticipation of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page410">[pg
          410]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg410"></a>
          the future. But since pain is essential to life, and its degree is
          also determined by the nature of the subject, sudden changes,
          because they are always external, cannot really alter its degree.
          Thus an error and delusion always lies at the foundation of
          immoderate joy or grief, and consequently both these excessive
          strainings of the mind can be avoided by knowledge. Every
          immoderate joy (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">exultatio, insolens
          lætitia</span></span>) always rests on the delusion that one has
          found in life what can never be found there—lasting satisfaction of
          the harassing desires and cares, which are constantly breeding new
          ones. From every particular delusion of this kind one must
          inevitably be brought back later, and then when it vanishes must
          pay for it with pain as bitter as the joy its entrance caused was
          keen. So far, then, it is precisely like a height from which one
          can come down only by a fall. Therefore one ought to avoid them;
          and every sudden excessive grief is just a fall from some such
          height, the vanishing of such a delusion, and so conditioned by it.
          Consequently we might avoid them both if we had sufficient control
          over ourselves to survey things always with perfect clearness as a
          whole and in their connection, and steadfastly to guard against
          really lending them the colours which we wish they had. The
          principal effort of the Stoical ethics was to free the mind from
          all such delusion and its consequences, and to give it instead an
          equanimity that could not be disturbed. It is this insight that
          inspires Horace in the well-known ode—</p>

          every one carries about with him its perennial source in his own

          which we are ashamed, yet we do not see that we draw water with the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus it either
          goes on for ever, or, what is more rare and presupposes a certain
          strength of character, till we reach a wish which is not satisfied
          and yet cannot be given up. In that case we have, as it were, found
          what we sought, something that we can always blame, instead of our
          own nature, as the source of our suffering. And thus, although we
          are now at variance with our fate, we are reconciled to our
          existence, for the knowledge is again put far from us that
          suffering is essential to this existence itself, and true
          satisfaction impossible. The result of this form of development is
          a somewhat melancholy disposition, the constant endurance of a
          single great pain, and the contempt for all lesser sorrows or joys
          that proceeds from it; consequently an already nobler phenomenon
          than that constant seizing upon ever-new forms of illusion, which
          is much more common.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 58. All
          satisfaction, or what is commonly called happiness, is always
          really and essentially only <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">negative</span></em>, and never positive. It
          is not an original gratification coming to us of itself, but must
          always be the satisfaction of a wish. The wish, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          some want, is the condition which precedes every pleasure. But with
          the satisfaction the wish and therefore the pleasure cease. Thus
          the satisfaction or the pleasing can never be more than the
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page412">[pg 412]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg412"></a> deliverance from a
          pain, from a want; for such is not only every actual, open sorrow,
          but every desire, the importunity of which disturbs our peace, and,
          indeed, the deadening ennui also that makes life a burden to us. It
          is, however, so hard to attain or achieve anything; difficulties
          and troubles without end are opposed to every purpose, and at every
          step hindrances accumulate. But when finally everything is overcome
          and attained, nothing can ever be gained but deliverance from some
          sorrow or desire, so that we find ourselves just in the same
          position as we occupied before this sorrow or desire appeared. All
          that is even directly given us is merely the want, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          the pain. The satisfaction and the pleasure we can only know
          indirectly through the remembrance of the preceding suffering and
          want, which ceases with its appearance. Hence it arises that we are
          not properly conscious of the blessings and advantages we actually
          possess, nor do we prize them, but think of them merely as a matter
          of course, for they gratify us only negatively by restraining
          suffering. Only when we have lost them do we become sensible of
          their value; for the want, the privation, the sorrow, is the
          positive, communicating itself directly to us. Thus also we are
          pleased by the remembrance of past need, sickness, want, and such
          like, because this is the only means of enjoying the present
          blessings. And, further, it cannot be denied that in this respect,
          and from this standpoint of egoism, which is the form of the will
          to live, the sight or the description of the sufferings of others
          affords us satisfaction and pleasure in precisely the way Lucretius
          beautifully and frankly expresses it in the beginning of the Second
          Book—</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yet we shall see
          farther on that this kind of pleasure, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page413">[pg 413]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg413"></a> through knowledge of our own well-being
          obtained in this way, lies very near the source of real, positive
          wickedness.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That all
          happiness is only of a negative not a positive nature, that just on
          this account it cannot be lasting satisfaction and gratification,
          but merely delivers us from some pain or want which must be
          followed either by a new pain, or by languor, empty longing, and
          ennui; this finds support in art, that true mirror of the world and
          life, and especially in poetry. Every epic and dramatic poem can
          only represent a struggle, an effort, and fight for happiness,
          never enduring and complete happiness itself. It conducts its
          heroes through a thousand difficulties and dangers to the goal; as
          soon as this is reached, it hastens to let the curtain fall; for
          now there would remain nothing for it to do but to show that the
          glittering goal in which the hero expected to find happiness had
          only disappointed him, and that after its attainment he was no
          better off than before. Because a genuine enduring happiness is not
          possible, it cannot be the subject of art. Certainly the aim of the
          idyll is the description of such a happiness, but one also sees
          that the idyll as such cannot continue. The poet always finds that
          it either becomes epical in his hands, and in this case it is a
          very insignificant epic, made up of trifling sorrows, trifling
          delights, and trifling efforts—this is the commonest case—or else
          it becomes a merely descriptive poem, describing the beauty of
          nature, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, pure knowing free from
          will, which certainly, as a matter of fact, is the only pure
          happiness, which is neither preceded by suffering or want, nor
          necessarily followed by repentance, sorrow, emptiness, or satiety;
          but this happiness cannot fill the whole life, but is only possible
          at moments. What we see in poetry we find again in music; in the
          melodies of which we have recognised the universal expression of
          the inmost history of the self-conscious will, the most secret
          life, longing, suffering, and delight; the ebb and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page414">[pg 414]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg414"></a> flow of the human heart. Melody is
          always a deviation from the keynote through a thousand capricious
          wanderings, even to the most painful discord, and then a final
          return to the keynote which expresses the satisfaction and
          appeasing of the will, but with which nothing more can then be
          done, and the continuance of which any longer would only be a
          wearisome and unmeaning monotony corresponding to ennui.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All that we
          intend to bring out clearly through these investigations, the
          impossibility of attaining lasting satisfaction and the negative
          nature of all happiness, finds its explanation in what is shown at
          the conclusion of the Second Book: that the will, of which human
          life, like every phenomenon, is the objectification, is a striving
          without aim or end. We find the stamp of this endlessness imprinted
          upon all the parts of its whole manifestation, from its most
          universal form, endless time and space, up to the most perfect of
          all phenomena, the life and efforts of man. We may theoretically
          assume three extremes of human life, and treat them as elements of
          actual human life. First, the powerful will, the strong passions
          (Radscha-Guna). It appears in great historical characters; it is
          described in the epic and the drama. But it can also show itself in
          the little world, for the size of the objects is measured here by
          the degree in which they influence the will, not according to their
          external relations. Secondly, pure knowing, the comprehension of
          the Ideas, conditioned by the freeing of knowledge from the service
          of will: the life of genius (Satwa-Guna). Thirdly and lastly, the
          greatest lethargy of the will, and also of the knowledge attaching
          to it, empty longing, life-benumbing languor (Tama-Guna). The life
          of the individual, far from becoming permanently fixed in one of
          these extremes, seldom touches any of them, and is for the most
          part only a weak and wavering approach to one or the other side, a
          needy desiring of trifling objects, constantly recurring, and so
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page415">[pg 415]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg415"></a> escaping ennui. It
          is really incredible how meaningless and void of significance when
          looked at from without, how dull and unenlightened by intellect
          when felt from within, is the course of the life of the great
          majority of men. It is a weary longing and complaining, a
          dream-like staggering through the four ages of life to death,
          accompanied by a series of trivial thoughts. Such men are like
          clockwork, which is wound up, and goes it knows not why; and every
          time a man is begotten and born, the clock of human life is wound
          up anew, to repeat the same old piece it has played innumerable
          times before, passage after passage, measure after measure, with
          insignificant variations. Every individual, every human being and
          his course of life, is but another short dream of the endless
          spirit of nature, of the persistent will to live; is only another
          fleeting form, which it carelessly sketches on its infinite page,
          space and time; allows to remain for a time so short that it
          vanishes into nothing in comparison with these, and then
          obliterates to make new room. And yet, and here lies the serious
          side of life, every one of these fleeting forms, these empty
          fancies, must be paid for by the whole will to live, in all its
          activity, with many and deep sufferings, and finally with a bitter
          death, long feared and coming at last. This is why the sight of a
          corpse makes us suddenly so serious.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The life of
          every individual, if we survey it as a whole and in general, and
          only lay stress upon its most significant features, is really
          always a tragedy, but gone through in detail, it has the character
          of a comedy. For the deeds and vexations of the day, the restless
          irritation of the moment, the desires and fears of the week, the
          mishaps of every hour, are all through chance, which is ever bent
          upon some jest, scenes of a comedy. But the never-satisfied wishes,
          the frustrated efforts, the hopes unmercifully crushed by fate, the
          unfortunate errors of the whole life, with increasing suffering and
          death at the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page416">[pg
          416]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg416"></a>
          end, are always a tragedy. Thus, as if fate would add derision to
          the misery of our existence, our life must contain all the woes of
          tragedy, and yet we cannot even assert the dignity of tragic
          characters, but in the broad detail of life must inevitably be the
          foolish characters of a comedy.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But however much
          great and small trials may fill human life, they are not able to
          conceal its insufficiency to satisfy the spirit; they cannot hide
          the emptiness and superficiality of existence, nor exclude ennui,
          which is always ready to fill up every pause that care may allow.
          Hence it arises that the human mind, not content with the cares,
          anxieties, and occupations which the actual world lays upon it,
          creates for itself an imaginary world also in the form of a
          thousand different superstitions, then finds all manner of
          employment with this, and wastes time and strength upon it, as soon
          as the real world is willing to grant it the rest which it is quite
          incapable of enjoying. This is accordingly most markedly the case
          with nations for which life is made easy by the congenial nature of
          the climate and the soil, most of all with the Hindus, then with
          the Greeks, the Romans, and later with the Italians, the Spaniards,
          &amp;c. Demons, gods, and saints man creates in his own image; and
          to them he must then unceasingly bring offerings, prayers, temple
          decorations, vows and their fulfilment, pilgrimages, salutations,
          ornaments for their images, &amp;c. Their service mingles
          everywhere with the real, and, indeed, obscures it. Every event of
          life is regarded as the work of these beings; the intercourse with
          them occupies half the time of life, constantly sustains hope, and
          by the charm of illusion often becomes more interesting than
          intercourse with real beings. It is the expression and symptom of
          the actual need of mankind, partly for help and support, partly for
          occupation and diversion; and if it often works in direct
          opposition to the first need, because when accidents and dangers
          arise valuable time <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page417">[pg
          417]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg417"></a>
          and strength, instead of being directed to warding them off, are
          uselessly wasted on prayers and offerings; it serves the second end
          all the better by this imaginary converse with a visionary spirit
          world; and this is the by no means contemptible gain of all
          superstitions.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 59. If we have
          so far convinced ourselves <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          priori</span></span>, by the most general consideration, by
          investigation of the primary and elemental features of human life,
          that in its whole plan it is capable of no true blessedness, but is
          in its very nature suffering in various forms, and throughout a
          state of misery, we might now awaken this conviction much more
          vividly within us if, proceeding more <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          posteriori</span></span>, we were to turn to more definite
          instances, call up pictures to the fancy, and illustrate by
          examples the unspeakable misery which experience and history
          present, wherever one may look and in whatever direction one may
          seek. But the chapter would have no end, and would carry us far
          from the standpoint of the universal, which is essential to
          philosophy; and, moreover, such a description might easily be taken
          for a mere declamation on human misery, such as has often been
          given, and, as such, might be charged with one-sidedness, because
          it started from particular facts. From such a reproach and
          suspicion our perfectly cold and philosophical investigation of the
          inevitable suffering which is founded in the nature of life is
          free, for it starts from the universal and is conducted <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span>. But confirmation
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a posteriori</span></span> is everywhere
          easily obtained. Every one who has awakened from the first dream of
          youth, who has considered his own experience and that of others,
          who has studied himself in life, in the history of the past and of
          his own time, and finally in the works of the great poets, will, if
          his judgment is not paralysed by some indelibly imprinted
          prejudice, certainly arrive at the conclusion that this human world
          is the kingdom of chance and error, which rule without mercy in
          great things and in small, and along with which folly and
          wickedness also wield the scourge. Hence it arises <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page418">[pg 418]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg418"></a> that everything better only struggles
          through with difficulty; what is noble and wise seldom attains to
          expression, becomes effective and claims attention, but the absurd
          and the perverse in the sphere of thought, the dull and tasteless
          in the sphere of art, the wicked and deceitful in the sphere of
          action, really assert a supremacy, only disturbed by short
          interruptions. On the other hand, everything that is excellent is
          always a mere exception, one case in millions, and therefore, if it
          presents itself in a lasting work, this, when it has outlived the
          enmity of its contemporaries, exists in isolation, is preserved
          like a meteoric stone, sprung from an order of things different
          from that which prevails here. But as far as the life of the
          individual is concerned, every biography is the history of
          suffering, for every life is, as a rule, a continual series of
          great and small misfortunes, which each one conceals as much as
          possible, because he knows that others can seldom feel sympathy or
          compassion, but almost always satisfaction at the sight of the woes
          from which they are themselves for the moment exempt. But perhaps
          at the end of life, if a man is sincere and in full possession of
          his faculties, he will never wish to have it to live over again,
          but rather than this, he will much prefer absolute annihilation.
          The essential content of the famous soliloquy in <span class="tei tei-q">“Hamlet”</span> is briefly this: Our state is so
          wretched that absolute annihilation would be decidedly preferable.
          If suicide really offered us this, so that the alternative
          <span class="tei tei-q">“to be or not to be,”</span> in the full
          sense of the word, was placed before us, then it would be
          unconditionally to be chosen as <span class="tei tei-q">“a
          consummation devoutly to be wished.”</span> But there is something
          in us which tells us that this is not the case: suicide is not the
          end; death is not absolute annihilation. In like manner, what was
          said by the father of history<a href="#note_71" id="noteref_71" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">71</span></span></a> has
          not since him been contradicted, that no man has ever lived who has
          not wished more than once that he had not to live the following
          day. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page419">[pg 419]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg419"></a> According to this,
          the brevity of life, which is so constantly lamented, may be the
          best quality it possesses. If, finally, we should bring clearly to
          a man's sight the terrible sufferings and miseries to which his
          life is constantly exposed, he would be seized with horror; and if
          we were to conduct the confirmed optimist through the hospitals,
          infirmaries, and surgical operating-rooms, through the prisons,
          torture-chambers, and slave-kennels, over battle-fields and places
          of execution; if we were to open to him all the dark abodes of
          misery, where it hides itself from the glance of cold curiosity,
          and, finally, allow him to glance into the starving dungeon of
          Ugolino, he, too, would understand at last the nature of this
          <span class="tei tei-q">“best of possible worlds.”</span> For
          whence did Dante take the materials for his hell but from this our
          actual world? And yet he made a very proper hell of it. And when,
          on the other hand, he came to the task of describing heaven and its
          delights, he had an insurmountable difficulty before him, for our
          world affords no materials at all for this. Therefore there
          remained nothing for him to do but, instead of describing the joys
          of paradise, to repeat to us the instruction given him there by his
          ancestor, by Beatrice, and by various saints. But from this it is
          sufficiently clear what manner of world it is. Certainly human
          life, like all bad ware, is covered over with a false lustre: what
          suffers always conceals itself; on the other hand, whatever pomp or
          splendour any one can get, he makes a show of openly, and the more
          inner contentment deserts him, the more he desires to exist as
          fortunate in the opinion of others: to such an extent does folly
          go, and the opinion of others is a chief aim of the efforts of
          every one, although the utter nothingness of it is expressed in the
          fact that in almost all languages vanity, <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">vanitas</span></span>, originally signifies
          emptiness and nothingness. But under all this false show, the
          miseries of life can so increase—and this happens every day—that
          the death which hitherto has been feared above all things is
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page420">[pg 420]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg420"></a> eagerly seized upon.
          Indeed, if fate will show its whole malice, even this refuge is
          denied to the sufferer, and, in the hands of enraged enemies, he
          may remain exposed to terrible and slow tortures without remedy. In
          vain the sufferer then calls on his gods for help; he remains
          exposed to his fate without grace. But this irremediableness is
          only the mirror of the invincible nature of his will, of which his
          person is the objectivity. As little as an external power can
          change or suppress this will, so little can a foreign power deliver
          it from the miseries which proceed from the life which is the
          phenomenal appearance of that will. In the principal matter, as in
          everything else, a man is always thrown back upon himself. In vain
          does he make to himself gods in order to get from them by prayers
          and flattery what can only be accomplished by his own will-power.
          The Old Testament made the world and man the work of a god, but the
          New Testament saw that, in order to teach that holiness and
          salvation from the sorrows of this world can only come from the
          world itself, it was necessary that this god should become man. It
          is and remains the will of man upon which everything depends for
          him. Fanatics, martyrs, saints of every faith and name, have
          voluntarily and gladly endured every torture, because in them the
          will to live had suppressed itself; and then even the slow
          destruction of its phenomenon was welcome to them. But I do not
          wish to anticipate the later exposition. For the rest, I cannot
          here avoid the statement that, to me, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">optimism</span></em>, when it is not merely
          the thoughtless talk of such as harbour nothing but words under
          their low foreheads, appears not merely as an absurd, but also as a
          really <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">wicked</span></em> way of thinking, as a
          bitter mockery of the unspeakable suffering of humanity. Let no one
          think that Christianity is favourable to optimism; for, on the
          contrary, in the Gospels world and evil are used as almost
          synonymous.<a href="#note_72" id="noteref_72" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">72</span></span></a></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page421">[pg 421]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg421"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 60. We have
          now completed the two expositions it was necessary to insert; the
          exposition of the freedom of the will in itself together with the
          necessity of its phenomenon, and the exposition of its lot in the
          world which reflects its own nature, and upon the knowledge of
          which it has to assert or deny itself. Therefore we can now proceed
          to bring out more clearly the nature of this assertion and denial
          itself, which was referred to and explained in a merely general way
          above. This we shall do by exhibiting the conduct in which alone it
          finds its expression, and considering it in its inner
          significance.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">assertion of the
          will</span></em> is the continuous willing itself, undisturbed by
          any knowledge, as it fills the life of man in general. For even the
          body of a man is the objectivity of the will, as it appears at this
          grade and in this individual. And thus his willing which develops
          itself in time is, as it were, a paraphrase of his body, an
          elucidation of the significance of the whole and its parts; it is
          another way of exhibiting the same thing-in-itself, of which the
          body is already the phenomenon. Therefore, instead of saying
          assertion of the will, we may say assertion of the body. The
          fundamental theme or subject of all the multifarious acts of will
          is the satisfaction of the wants which are inseparable from the
          existence of the body in health, they already have their expression
          in it, and may be referred to the maintenance of the individual and
          the propagation of the species. But indirectly the most different
          kinds of motives obtain in this way power over the will, and bring
          about the most multifarious acts of will. Each of these is only an
          example, an instance, of the will which here manifests itself
          generally. Of what nature this example may be, what form the motive
          may have and impart to it, is not essential; the important point
          here is that something is willed in general and the degree of
          intensity with which it is so willed. The will can only become
          visible in the motives, as the eye only manifests its power of
          seeing in the light. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page422">[pg
          422]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg422"></a>
          The motive in general stands before the will in protean forms. It
          constantly promises complete satisfaction, the quenching of the
          thirst of will. But whenever it is attained it at once appears in
          another form, and thus influences the will anew, always according
          to the degree of the intensity of this will, and its relation to
          knowledge which are revealed as empirical character, in these very
          examples and instances.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From the first
          appearance of consciousness, a man finds himself a willing being,
          and as a rule, his knowledge remains in constant relation to his
          will. He first seeks to know thoroughly the objects of his desire,
          and then the means of attaining them. Now he knows what he has to
          do, and, as a rule, he does not strive after other knowledge. He
          moves and acts; his consciousness keeps him always working directly
          and actively towards the aims of his will; his thought is concerned
          with the choice of motives. Such is life for almost all men; they
          wish, they know what they wish, and they strive after it, with
          sufficient success to keep them from despair, and sufficient
          failure to keep them from ennui and its consequences. From this
          proceeds a certain serenity, or at least indifference, which cannot
          be affected by wealth or poverty; for the rich and the poor do not
          enjoy what they have, for this, as we have shown, acts in a purely
          negative way, but what they hope to attain to by their efforts.
          They press forward with much earnestness, and indeed with an air of
          importance; thus children also pursue their play. It is always an
          exception if such a life suffers interruption from the fact that
          either the æsthetic demand for contemplation or the ethical demand
          for renunciation proceed from a knowledge which is independent of
          the service of the will, and directed to the nature of the world in
          general. Most men are pursued by want all through life, without
          ever being allowed to come to their senses. On the other hand, the
          will is often inflamed to a degree that far transcends the
          assertion of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page423">[pg
          423]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg423"></a>
          body, and then violent emotions and powerful passions show
          themselves, in which the individual not only asserts his own
          existence, but denies and seeks to suppress that of others when it
          stands in his way.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The maintenance
          of the body through its own powers is so small a degree of the
          assertion of will, that if it voluntarily remains at this degree,
          we might assume that, with the death of this body, the will also
          which appeared in it would be extinguished. But even the
          satisfaction of the sexual passions goes beyond the assertion of
          one's own existence, which fills so short a time, and asserts life
          for an indefinite time after the death of the individual. Nature,
          always true and consistent, here even naïve, exhibits to us openly
          the inner significance of the act of generation. Our own
          consciousness, the intensity of the impulse, teaches us that in
          this act the most decided <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">assertion of the will to live</span></em>
          expresses itself, pure and without further addition (any denial of
          other individuals); and now, as the consequence of this act, a new
          life appears in time and the causal series, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          in nature; the begotten appears before the begetter, different as
          regards the phenomenon, but in himself, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          according to the Idea, identical with him. Therefore it is this act
          through which every species of living creature binds itself to a
          whole and is perpetuated. Generation is, with reference to the
          begetter, only the expression, the symptom, of his decided
          assertion of the will to live: with reference to the begotten, it
          is not the cause of the will which appears in him, for the will in
          itself knows neither cause nor effect, but, like all causes, it is
          merely the occasional cause of the phenomenal appearance of this
          will at this time in this place. As thing-in-itself, the will of
          the begetter and that of the begotten are not different, for only
          the phenomenon, not the thing-in-itself, is subordinate to the
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principim individuationis</span></span>. With
          that assertion beyond our own body and extending to the production
          of a new body, suffering <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page424">[pg
          424]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg424"></a>
          and death, as belonging to the phenomenon of life, have also been
          asserted anew, and the possibility of salvation, introduced by the
          completest capability of knowledge, has for this time been shown to
          be fruitless. Here lies the profound reason of the shame connected
          with the process of generation. This view is mythically expressed
          in the dogma of Christian theology that we are all partakers in
          Adam's first transgression (which is clearly just the satisfaction
          of sexual passion), and through it are guilty of suffering and
          death. In this theology goes beyond the consideration of things
          according to the principle of sufficient reason, and recognises the
          Idea of man, the unity of which is re-established out of its
          dispersion into innumerable individuals through the bond of
          generation which holds them all together. Accordingly it regards
          every individual as on one side identical with Adam, the
          representative of the assertion of life, and, so far, as subject to
          sin (original sin), suffering, and death; on the other side, the
          knowledge of the Idea of man enables it to regard every individual
          as identical with the saviour, the representative of the denial of
          the will to live, and, so far as a partaker of his sacrifice of
          himself, saved through his merits, and delivered from the bands of
          sin and death, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the world (Rom. v.
          12-21).</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another mythical
          exposition of our view of sexual pleasure as the assertion of the
          will to live beyond the individual life, as an attainment to life
          which is brought about for the first time by this means, or as it
          were a renewed assignment of life, is the Greek myth of Proserpine,
          who might return from the lower world so long as she had not tasted
          its fruit, but who became subject to it altogether through eating
          the pomegranate. This meaning appears very clearly in Goethe's
          incomparable presentation of this myth, especially when, as soon as
          she has tasted the pomegranate, the invisible chorus of the
          Fates—</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page425">[pg

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is worth
          noticing that Clement of Alexandria (Strom. iii. c. 15) illustrates
          the matter with the same image and the same expression: Οἱ μεν
          ευνουχισαντες ἑαυτους απο πασης ἁμαρτιας, δια την βασιλειαν, των
          ουρανων, μακαριοι οὑτοι εισιν, οἱ του κοσμου νηστευοντες;
          (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Qui se castrarunt ab omni peccato propter
          regnum cœlorum, ii sunt beati, a mundo
          jejunantes</span></span>).</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sexual
          impulse also proves itself the decided and strongest assertion of
          life by the fact that to man in a state of nature, as to the
          brutes, it is the final end, the highest goal of life.
          Self-maintenance is his first effort, and as soon as he has made
          provision for that, he only strives after the propagation of the
          species: as a merely natural being he can attempt no more. Nature
          also, the inner being of which is the will to live itself, impels
          with all her power both man and the brute towards propagation. Then
          it has attained its end with the individual, and is quite
          indifferent to its death, for, as the will to live, it cares only
          for the preservation of the species, the individual is nothing to
          it. Because the will to live expresses itself most strongly in the
          sexual impulse, the inner being of nature, the old poets and
          philosophers—Hesiod and Parmenides—said very significantly that
          Eros is the first, the creator, the principle from which all things
          proceed. (Cf. Arist. Metaph., i. 4.) Pherecydes said: Εις ερωτα
          μεταβεβλησθαι τον Δια, μελλοντα δημιουργειν (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Jovem, cum mundum fabricare vellet, in
          cupidinem sese transformasse</span></span>). <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Proclus ad Plat.
          Tim.</span></span>, l. iii. A complete treatment of this subject we
          have recently received from G. F. Schœmann, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De Cupidine Cosmogonico</span></span>,”</span>
          1852. The Mâya of the Hindus, whose work and web is the whole world
          of illusion, is also symbolised by love.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The genital
          organs are, far more than any other external member of the body,
          subject merely to the will, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page426">[pg 426]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg426"></a> not at all to knowledge. Indeed, the will
          shows itself here almost as independent of knowledge, as in those
          parts which, acting merely in consequence of stimuli, are
          subservient to vegetative life and reproduction, in which the will
          works blindly as in unconscious nature. For generation is only
          reproduction passing over to a new individual, as it were
          reproduction at the second power, as death is only excretion at the
          second power. According to all this, the genitals are properly the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">focus</span></em> of will, and consequently
          the opposite pole of the brain, the representative of knowledge,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the other side of the
          world, the world as idea. The former are the life-sustaining
          principle ensuring endless life to time. In this respect they were
          worshipped by the Greeks in the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">phallus</span></span>, and by the Hindus in
          the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">lingam</span></span>, which
          are thus the symbol of the assertion of the will. Knowledge, on the
          other hand, affords the possibility of the suppression of willing,
          of salvation through freedom, of conquest and annihilation of the
          world.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We already
          considered fully at the beginning of this Fourth Book how the will
          to live in its assertion must regard its relation to death. We saw
          that death does not trouble it, because it exists as something
          included in life itself and belonging to it. Its opposite,
          generation, completely counterbalances it; and, in spite of the
          death of the individual, ensures and guarantees life to the will to
          live through all time. To express this the Hindus made the
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">lingam</span></span> an attribute of Siva, the
          god of death. We also fully explained there how he who with full
          consciousness occupies the standpoint of the decided assertion of
          life awaits death without fear. We shall therefore say nothing more
          about this here. Without clear consciousness most men occupy this
          standpoint and continually assert life. The world exists as the
          mirror of this assertion, with innumerable individuals in infinite
          time and space, in infinite suffering, between generation and death
          without end. Yet from no side is a complaint to be <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page427">[pg 427]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg427"></a> further raised about this; for the will
          conducts the great tragedy and comedy at its own expense, and is
          also its own spectator. The world is just what it is because the
          will, whose manifestation it is, is what it is, because it so
          wills. The justification of suffering is, that in this phenomenon
          also the will asserts itself; and this assertion is justified and
          balanced by the fact that the will bears the suffering. Here we get
          a glimpse of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">eternal justice</span></em> in the whole: we
          shall recognise it later more definitely and distinctly, and also
          in the particular. But first we must consider temporal or human
          justice.<a href="#note_73" id="noteref_73" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">73</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Section_61"></a> § 61. It
          may be remembered from the Second Book that in the whole of nature,
          at all the grades of the objectification of will, there was a
          necessary and constant conflict between the individuals of all
          species; and in this way was expressed the inner contradiction of
          the will to live with itself. At the highest grade of the
          objectification, this phenomenon, like all others, will exhibit
          itself with greater distinctness, and will therefore be more easily
          explained. With this aim we shall next attempt to trace the source
          of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">egoism</span></em> as the starting-point of
          all conflict.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have called
          time and space the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium
          individuationis</span></span>, because only through them and in
          them is multiplicity of the homogeneous possible. They are the
          essential forms of natural knowledge, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          knowledge springing from the will. Therefore the will everywhere
          manifests itself in the multiplicity of individuals. But this
          multiplicity does not concern the will as thing-in-itself, but only
          its phenomena. The will itself is present, whole and undivided, in
          every one of these, and beholds around it the innumerably repeated
          image of its own nature; but this nature itself, the actually real,
          it finds directly only in its inner self. Therefore every one
          desires everything for himself, desires to possess, or at least to
          control, everything, and whatever opposes it it would like to
          destroy. To this is added, in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page428">[pg 428]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg428"></a> the case of such beings as have knowledge,
          that the individual is the supporter of the knowing subject, and
          the knowing subject is the supporter of the world, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          that the whole of Nature outside the knowing subject, and thus also
          all other individuals, exist only in its idea; it is only conscious
          of them as its idea, thus merely indirectly as something which is
          dependent on its own nature and existence; for with its
          consciousness the world necessarily disappears for it, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          its being and non-being become synonymous and indistinguishable.
          Every knowing individual is thus in truth, and finds itself as the
          whole will to live, or the inner being of the world itself, and
          also as the complemental condition of the world as idea,
          consequently as a microcosm which is of equal value with the
          macrocosm. Nature itself, which is everywhere and always truthful,
          gives him this knowledge, originally and independently of all
          reflection, with simple and direct certainty. Now from these two
          necessary properties we have given the fact may be explained that
          every individual, though vanishing altogether and diminished to
          nothing in the boundless world, yet makes itself the centre of the
          world, has regard for its own existence and well-being before
          everything else; indeed, from the natural standpoint, is ready to
          sacrifice everything else for this—is ready to annihilate the world
          in order to maintain its own self, this drop in the ocean, a little
          longer. This disposition is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">egoism</span></em>, which is essential to
          everything in Nature. Yet it is just through egoism that the inner
          conflict of the will with itself attains to such a terrible
          revelation; for this egoism has its continuance and being in that
          opposition of the microcosm and macrocosm, or in the fact that the
          objectification of will has the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium individuationis</span></span> for
          its form, through which the will manifests itself in the same way
          in innumerable individuals, and indeed entire and completely in
          both aspects (will and idea) in each. Thus, while each individual
          is given to itself directly as the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page429">[pg 429]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg429"></a> whole will and the whole subject of ideas,
          other individuals are only given it as ideas. Therefore its own
          being, and the maintenance of it, is of more importance to it than
          that of all others together. Every one looks upon his own death as
          upon the end of the world, while he accepts the death of his
          acquaintances as a matter of comparative indifference, if he is not
          in some way affected by it. In the consciousness that has reached
          the highest grade, that of man, egoism, as well as knowledge, pain
          and pleasure, must have reached its highest grade also, and the
          conflict of individuals which is conditioned by it must appear in
          its most terrible form. And indeed we see this everywhere before
          our eyes, in small things as in great. Now we see its terrible side
          in the lives of great tyrants and miscreants, and in
          world-desolating wars; now its absurd side, in which it is the
          theme of comedy, and very specially appears as self-conceit and
          vanity. Rochefoucault understood this better than any one else, and
          presented it in the abstract. We see it both in the history of the
          world and in our own experience. But it appears most distinctly of
          all when any mob of men is set free from all law and order; then
          there shows itself at once in the distinctest form the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">bellum omnium contra omnes</span></span>,
          which Hobbes has so admirably described in the first chapter
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De
          Cive</span></span>. We see not only how every one tries to seize
          from the other what he wants himself, but how often one will
          destroy the whole happiness or life of another for the sake of an
          insignificant addition to his own happiness. This is the highest
          expression of egoism, the manifestations of which in this regard
          are only surpassed by those of actual wickedness, which seeks,
          quite disinterestedly, the hurt and suffering of others, without
          any advantage to itself. Of this we shall speak soon. With this
          exhibition of the source of egoism the reader should compare the
          presentation of it in my prize-essay on the basis of morals, §
          14.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A chief source
          of that suffering which we found above <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page430">[pg 430]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg430"></a> to be essential and inevitable to all life
          is, when it really appears in a definite form, that <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">Eris</span></span>, the conflict of all
          individuals, the expression of the contradiction, with which the
          will to live is affected in its inner self, and which attains a
          visible form through the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium
          individuationis</span></span>. Wild-beast fights are the most cruel
          means of showing this directly and vividly. In this original
          discord lies an unquenchable source of suffering, in spite of the
          precautions that have been taken against it, and which we shall now
          consider more closely.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 62. It has
          already been explained that the first and simplest assertion of the
          will to live is only the assertion of one's own body, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          the exhibition of the will through acts in time, so far as the
          body, in its form and design, exhibits the same will in space, and
          no further. This assertion shows itself as maintenance of the body,
          by means of the application of its own powers. To it is directly
          related the satisfaction of the sexual impulse; indeed this belongs
          to it, because the genitals belong to the body. Therefore
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">voluntary</span></em> renunciation of the
          satisfaction of that impulse, based upon no <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">motive</span></em>,
          is already a denial of the will to live, is a voluntary
          self-suppression of it, upon the entrance of knowledge which acts
          as a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">quieter</span></em>. Accordingly such denial
          of one's own body exhibits itself as a contradiction by the will of
          its own phenomenon. For although here also the body objectifies in
          the genitals the will to perpetuate the species, yet this is not
          willed. Just on this account, because it is a denial or suppression
          of the will to live, such a renunciation is a hard and painful
          self-conquest; but of this later. But since the will exhibits that
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">self-assertion</span></em> of one's own body
          in innumerable individuals beside each other, it very easily
          extends in one individual, on account of the egoism peculiar to
          them all, beyond this assertion to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">denial</span></em>
          of the same will appearing in another individual. The will of the
          first breaks through the limits of the assertion of will of
          another, because the individual either destroys or injures
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page431">[pg 431]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg431"></a> this other body
          itself, or else because it compels the powers of the other body to
          serve <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">its
          own</span></em> will, instead of the will which manifests itself in
          that other body. Thus if, from the will manifesting itself as
          another body, it withdraws the powers of this body, and so
          increases the power serving its own will beyond that of its own
          body, it consequently asserts its own will beyond its own body by
          means of the negation of the will appearing in another body. This
          breaking through the limits of the assertion of will of another has
          always been distinctly recognised, and its concept denoted by the
          word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">wrong</span></em>. For both sides recognise
          the fact instantly, not, indeed, as we do here in distinct
          abstraction, but as feeling. He who suffers wrong feels the
          transgression into the sphere of the assertion of his own body,
          through the denial of it by another individual, as a direct and
          mental pain which is entirely separated and different from the
          accompanying physical suffering experienced from the act or the
          vexation at the loss. To the doer of wrong, on the other hand, the
          knowledge presents itself that he is in himself the same will which
          appears in that body also, and which asserts itself with such
          vehemence; the one phenomenon that, transgressing the limits of its
          own body and its powers, it extends to the denial of this very will
          in another phenomenon, and so, regarded as will in itself, it
          strives against itself by this vehemence and rends itself.
          Moreover, this knowledge presents itself to him instantly, not
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">in abstracto</span></span>, but as an obscure
          feeling; and this is called remorse, or, more accurately in this
          case, the feeling of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">wrong committed</span></em>.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Wrong</span></em>,
          the conception of which we have thus analysed in its most general
          and abstract form, expresses itself in the concrete most
          completely, peculiarly, and palpably in cannibalism. This is its
          most distinct and evident type, the terrible picture of the
          greatest conflict of the will with itself at the highest grade of
          its objectification, which is man. Next to this, it expresses
          itself most distinctly <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page432">[pg
          432]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg432"></a>
          in murder; and therefore the committal of murder is followed
          instantly and with fearful distinctness by remorse, the abstract
          and dry significance of which we have just given, which inflicts a
          wound on our peace of mind that a lifetime cannot heal. For our
          horror at the murder committed, as also our shrinking from the
          committal of it, corresponds to that infinite clinging to life with
          which everything living, as phenomenon of the will to live, is
          penetrated. (We shall analyse this feeling which accompanies the
          doing of wrong and evil, in other words, the pangs of conscience,
          more fully later on, and raise its concept to distinctness.)
          Mutilation, or mere injury of another body, indeed every blow, is
          to be regarded as in its nature the same as murder, and differing
          from it only in degree. Further, wrong shows itself in the
          subjugation of another individual, in forcing him into slavery,
          and, finally, in the seizure of another's goods, which, so far as
          these goods are regarded as the fruit of his labour, is just the
          same thing as making him a slave, and is related to this as mere
          injury is to murder.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">property</span></em>, which is not taken from
          a man without <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">wrong</span></em>, can, according to our
          explanation of wrong, only be that which has been produced by his
          own powers. Therefore by taking this we really take the powers of
          his body from the will objectified in it, to make them subject to
          the will objectified in another body. For only so does the
          wrong-doer, by seizing, not the body of another, but a lifeless
          thing quite different from it, break into the sphere of the
          assertion of will of another person, because the powers, the work
          of this other body, are, as it were, incorporated and identified
          with this thing. It follows from this that all true, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          moral, right of property is based simply and solely on work, as was
          pretty generally assumed before Kant, and is distinctly and
          beautifully expressed in the oldest of all codes of law:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Wise men who know the past explain that a
          cultured field is the property of him who cut down the wood and
          cleared and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page433">[pg
          433]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg433"></a>
          ploughed it, as an antelope belongs to the first hunter who
          mortally wounds it”</span> (Laws of Manu, ix. 44). Kant's
          philosophy of law is an extraordinary concatenation of errors all
          leading to each other, and he bases the right of property upon
          first occupation. To me this is only explicable on the supposition
          that his powers were failing through old age. For how should the
          mere avowal of my will to exclude others from the use of a thing at
          once give me a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">right</span></em> to it? Clearly such an
          avowal itself requires a foundation of right, instead of being one,
          as Kant assumes. And how would he act unjustly <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">in se</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          morally, who does not respect that claim to the sole possession of
          a thing which is based upon nothing but its own avowal? How should
          his conscience trouble him about it? For it is so clear and easy to
          understand that there can be absolutely no such thing as a just
          seizure of anything, but only a just conversion or acquired
          possession of it, by spending our own original powers upon it.
          When, by any foreign labour, however little, a thing has been
          cultivated, improved, kept from harm or preserved, even if this
          labour were only the plucking or picking up from the ground of
          fruit that has grown wild; the person who forcibly seizes such a
          thing clearly deprives the other of the result of his labour
          expended upon it, makes the body of this other serve his will
          instead of its own, asserts his will beyond its own phenomenon to
          the denial of that of the other, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          does injustice or wrong.<a href="#note_74" id="noteref_74" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">74</span></span></a> On the
          other hand, the mere enjoyment of a thing, without any cultivation
          or preservation of it from destruction, gives just as little right
          to it as the mere avowal of our desire for its sole possession.
          Therefore, though one family has hunted a district alone, even for
          a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page434">[pg 434]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg434"></a> hundred years, but
          has done nothing for its improvement; if a stranger comes and
          desires to hunt there, it cannot prevent him from doing so without
          moral injustice. Thus the so-called right of preoccupation,
          according to which, for the mere past enjoyment of a thing, there
          is demanded the further recompense of the exclusive right to its
          future enjoyment, is morally entirely without foundation. A
          new-comer might with far better right reply to him who was
          depending upon such a right, <span class="tei tei-q">“Just because
          you have so long enjoyed, it is right that others should now enjoy
          also.”</span> No moral right can be established to the sole
          possession of anything upon which labour cannot be expended, either
          in improving it or in preserving it from harm, unless it be through
          a voluntary surrender on the part of others, as a reward for other
          services. This, however, already presupposes a community regulated
          by agreement—the State. The morally established right of property,
          as we have deduced it above, gives, from its nature, to the owner
          of a thing, the same unlimited power over it which he has over his
          own body; and hence it follows that he can part with his
          possessions to others either in exchange or as a gift, and they
          then possess them with the same moral right as he did.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As regards the
          doing of wrong generally, it occurs either through violence or
          through craft; it matters not which as far as what is morally
          essential is concerned. First, in the case of murder, it is a
          matter of indifference whether I make use of a dagger or of poison;
          and the case of every bodily injury is analogous. Other cases of
          wrong can all be reduced to the fact that I, as the doer of wrong,
          compel another individual to serve my will instead of his own, to
          act according to my will instead of according to his own. On the
          path of violence I attain this end through physical causality, but
          on the path of craft by means of motivation, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          by means of causality through knowledge; for I present to his will
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page435">[pg 435]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg435"></a> illusive motives, on
          account of which he follows my will, while he believes he is
          following his own. Since the medium in which the motives lie is
          knowledge, I can only accomplish this by falsifying his knowledge,
          and this is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">lie</span></em>. The lie always aims at
          influencing another's will, not merely his knowledge, for itself
          and as such, but only as a means, so far as it determines his will.
          For my lying itself, inasmuch as it proceeds from my will, requires
          a motive; and only the will of another can be such a motive, not
          his knowledge in and for itself; for as such it can never have an
          influence upon <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">my</span></em> will, therefore it can never
          move it, can never be a motive of its aim. But only the willing and
          doing of another can be this, and his knowledge indirectly through
          it. This holds good not only of all lies that have manifestly
          sprung from self-interest, but also of those which proceed from
          pure wickedness, which seeks enjoyment in the painful consequences
          of the error into which it has led another. Indeed, mere empty
          boasting aims at influencing the will and action of others more or
          less, by increasing their respect or improving their opinion of the
          boaster. The mere refusal of a truth, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          of an assertion generally, is in itself no wrong, but every
          imposing of a lie is certainly a wrong. He who refuses to show the
          strayed traveller the right road does him no wrong, but he who
          directs him to a false road certainly does. It follows from what
          has been said, that every <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">lie</span></em>, like every act of violence,
          is as such <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">wrong</span></em>, because as such it has for
          its aim the extension of the authority of my will to other
          individuals, and so the assertion of my will through the denial of
          theirs, just as much as violence has. But the most complete lie is
          the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">broken contract</span></em>, because here all
          the conditions mentioned are completely and distinctly present
          together. For when I enter into a contract, the promised
          performance of the other individual is directly and confessedly the
          motive for my reciprocal performance. The promises were
          deliberately <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page436">[pg
          436]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg436"></a>
          and formally exchanged. The fulfilment of the declarations made is,
          it is assumed, in the power of each. If the other breaks the
          covenant, he has deceived me, and by introducing merely illusory
          motives into my knowledge, he has bent my will according to his
          intention; he has extended the control of his will to another
          individual, and thus has committed a distinct wrong. On this is
          founded the moral lawfulness and validity of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">contract</span></em>.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Wrong through
          violence is not so <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">shameful</span></em> to the doer of it as
          wrong through craft; for the former arises from physical power,
          which under all circumstances impresses mankind; while the latter,
          by the use of subterfuge, betrays weakness, and lowers man at once
          as a physical and moral being. This is further the case because
          lying and deception can only succeed if he who employs them
          expresses at the same time horror and contempt of them in order to
          win confidence, and his victory rests on the fact that men credit
          him with honesty which he does not possess. The deep horror which
          is always excited by cunning, faithlessness, and treachery rests on
          the fact that good faith and honesty are the bond which externally
          binds into a unity the will which has been broken up into the
          multiplicity of individuals, and thereby limits the consequences of
          the egoism which results from that dispersion. Faithlessness and
          treachery break this outward bond asunder, and thus give boundless
          scope to the consequences of egoism.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the
          connection of our system we have found that the content of the
          concept of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">wrong</span></em> is that quality of the
          conduct of an individual in which he extends the assertion of the
          will appearing in his own body so far that it becomes the denial of
          the will appearing in the bodies of others. We have also laid down,
          by means of very general examples, the limits at which the province
          of wrong begins; for we have at once defined its gradations, from
          the highest degree to the lowest, by means of a few <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page437">[pg 437]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg437"></a> leading conceptions. According to this,
          the concept of wrong is the original and positive, and the concept
          of right, which is opposed to it, is the derivative and negative;
          for we must keep to the concepts, and not to the words. As a matter
          of fact, there would be no talk of right if there were no such
          thing as wrong. The concept right contains merely the negation of
          wrong, and every action is subsumed under it which does not
          transgress the limit laid down above, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          is not a denial of the will of another for the stronger assertion
          of our own. That limit, therefore, divides, as regards a purely
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">moral</span></em> definition, the whole
          province of possible actions into such as are wrong or right.
          Whenever an action does not encroach, in the way explained above,
          on the sphere of the assertion of will of another, denying it, it
          is not wrong. Therefore, for example, the refusal of help to
          another in great need, the quiet contemplation of the death of
          another from starvation while we ourselves have more than enough,
          is certainly cruel and fiendish, but it is not wrong; only it can
          be affirmed with certainty that whoever is capable of carrying
          unkindness and hardness to such a degree will certainly also commit
          every wrong whenever his wishes demand it and no compulsion
          prevents it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the
          conception of right as the negation of wrong finds its principal
          application, and no doubt its origin, in cases in which an
          attempted wrong by violence is warded off. This warding off cannot
          itself be wrong, and consequently is right, although the violence
          it requires, regarded in itself and in isolation, would be wrong,
          and is here only justified by the motive, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          becomes right. If an individual goes so far in the assertion of his
          own will that he encroaches upon the assertion of will which is
          essential to my person as such, and denies it, then my warding off
          of that encroachment is only the denial of that denial, and thus
          from my side is nothing more than the assertion of the will which
          essentially and originally appears in my body, and is already
          implicitly <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page438">[pg
          438]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg438"></a>
          expressed by the mere appearance of this body; consequently is not
          wrong, but right. That is to say: I have then a right to deny that
          denial of another with the force necessary to overcome it, and it
          is easy to see that this may extend to the killing of the other
          individual, whose encroachment as external violence pressing upon
          me may be warded off by a somewhat stronger counteraction, entirely
          without wrong, consequently with right. For all that happens from
          my side lies always within the sphere of the assertion of will
          essential to my person as such, and already expressed by it (which
          is the scene of the conflict), and does not encroach on that of the
          other, consequently is only negation of the negation, and thus
          affirmation, not itself negation. Thus if the will of another
          denies my will, as this appears in my body and the use of its
          powers for its maintenance, without denial of any foreign will
          which observes a like limitation, I can <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">without
          wrong</span></em> compel it to desist from such denial,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, I have so far a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">right of
          compulsion</span></em>.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In all cases in
          which I have a right of compulsion, a complete right to use
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">violence</span></em> against another, I may,
          according to the circumstances, just as well oppose the violence of
          the other with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">craft</span></em> without doing any wrong, and
          accordingly I have an actual <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">right to lie precisely so far as I have a
          right of compulsion</span></em>. Therefore a man acts with perfect
          right who assures a highway robber who is searching him that he has
          nothing more upon him; or, if a burglar has broken into his house
          by night, induces him by a lie to enter a cellar and then locks him
          in. A man who has been captured and carried off by robbers, for
          example by pirates, has the right to kill them not only by violence
          but also by craft, in order to regain his freedom. Thus, also, a
          promise is certainly not binding when it has been extorted by
          direct bodily violence, because he who suffers such compulsion may
          with full right free himself by killing, and, <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a fortiori</span></span>, by deceiving his
          oppressor. Whoever cannot recover through force the property which
          has <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page439">[pg 439]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg439"></a> been stolen from
          him, commits no wrong if he can accomplish it through craft.
          Indeed, if some one plays with me for money he has stolen from me,
          I have the right to use false dice against him, because all that I
          win from him already belongs to me. Whoever would deny this must
          still more deny the justifiableness of stratagem in war, which is
          just an acted lie, and is a proof of the saying of Queen Christina
          of Sweden, <span class="tei tei-q">“The words of men are to be
          esteemed as nothing; scarcely are their deeds to be
          trusted.”</span> So sharply does the limit of right border upon
          that of wrong. For the rest, I regard it as superfluous to show
          that all this completely agrees with what was said above about the
          unlawfulness of the lie and of violence. It may also serve to
          explain the peculiar theory of the lie told under pressure.<a href="#note_75" id="noteref_75" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">75</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In accordance
          with what has been said, wrong and right are merely moral
          determinations, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, such as are valid with
          regard to the consideration of human action as such, and in
          relation <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to the inner significance of this action in
          itself</span></em>. This asserts itself directly in consciousness
          through the fact that the doing of wrong is accompanied by an
          inward pain, which is the merely felt consciousness of the
          wrong-doer of the excessive strength of the assertion of will in
          itself, which extends even to the denial of the manifestation of
          the will of another, and also the consciousness that although he is
          different from the person suffering wrong as far as the
          manifestation is concerned, yet in himself he is identical with
          him. The further explanation of this inner significance of all pain
          of conscience cannot be given till later. He who suffers wrong is,
          on the other hand, painfully conscious of the denial of his will,
          as it is expressed through the body and its natural requirements,
          for the satisfaction of which nature refers him to the powers of
          his body; and at the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page440">[pg
          440]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg440"></a>
          same time he is conscious that without doing wrong he might ward
          off that denial by every means unless he lacks the power. This
          purely moral significance is the only one which right and wrong
          have for men as men, not as members of the State, and which
          consequently remains even when man is in a state of nature without
          any positive law. It constitutes the basis and the content of all
          that has on this account been named <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">natural
          law</span></em>, though it is better called moral law, for its
          validity does not extend to suffering, to the external reality, but
          only to the action of man and the self-knowledge of his individual
          will which grows up in him from his action, and which is called
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">conscience</span></em>. It cannot, however, in
          a state of nature, assert itself in all cases, and outwardly upon
          other individuals, and prevent might from reigning instead of
          right. In a state of nature it depends upon every one merely to see
          that in every case he <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">does</span></em> no wrong, but by no means to
          see that in every case he <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">suffers</span></em> no wrong, for this depends
          on the accident of his outward power. Therefore the concepts right
          and wrong, even in a state of nature, are certainly valid and by no
          means conventional, but there they are valid merely as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">moral</span></em>
          concepts, for the self-knowledge of one's own will in each. They
          are a fixed point in the scale of the very different degrees of
          strength with which the will to live asserts itself in human
          individuals, like the freezing-point on the thermometer; the point
          at which the assertion of one's own will becomes the denial of the
          will of another, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, specifies through
          wrong-doing the degree of its intensity, combined with the degree
          in which knowledge is involved in the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium individuationis</span></span>
          (which is the form of all knowledge that is subject to the will).
          But whoever wants to set aside the purely moral consideration of
          human action, or denies it, and wishes to regard conduct merely in
          its outward effects and their consequences, may certainly, with
          Hobbes, explain right and wrong as conventional definitions
          arbitrarily assumed, and therefore <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page441">[pg 441]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg441"></a> not existing outside positive law, and we can
          never show him through external experience what does not belong to
          such experience. Hobbes himself characterises his completely
          empirical method of thought very remarkably by the fact that in his
          book <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De Principiis
          Geometrarum</span></span>”</span> he denies all pure mathematics
          properly so called, and obstinately maintains that the point has
          extension and the line has breadth, and we can never show him a
          point without extension or a line without breadth. Thus we can just
          as little impart to him the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          priori</span></span> nature of mathematics as the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span> nature of right,
          because he shuts himself out from all knowledge which is not
          empirical.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The pure
          doctrine of right is thus a chapter of ethics, and is directly
          related only to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">action</span></em>, not to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">suffering</span></em>; for only the former is
          the expression of will, and this alone is considered by ethics.
          Suffering is mere occurrence. Ethics can only have regard to
          suffering indirectly, merely to show that what takes place merely
          to avoid suffering wrong is itself no infliction of wrong. The
          working out of this chapter of ethics would contain the precise
          definition of the limits to which an individual may go in the
          assertion of the will already objectified in his body without
          denying the same will as it appears in another individual; and also
          the actions which transgress these limits, which consequently are
          wrong, and therefore in their turn may be warded off without wrong.
          Thus our own <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">action</span></em> always remains the point of
          view of the investigation.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">suffering
          of wrong</span></em> appears as an event in outward experience, and
          in it is manifested, as we have said, more distinctly than anywhere
          else, the phenomenon of the conflict of the will to live with
          itself, arising from the multiplicity of individuals and from
          egoism, both of which are conditioned through the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium individuationis</span></span>,
          which is the form of the world as idea for the knowledge of the
          individual. We also saw above that a very large <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page442">[pg 442]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg442"></a> part of the suffering essential to
          human life has its perennial source in that conflict of
          individuals.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The reason,
          however, which is common to all these individuals, and which
          enables them to know not merely the particular case, as the brutes
          do, but also the whole abstractly in its connection, has also
          taught them to discern the source of that suffering, and induced
          them to consider the means of diminishing it, or, when possible, of
          suppressing it by a common sacrifice, which is, however, more than
          counterbalanced by the common advantage that proceeds from it.
          However agreeable it is to the egoism of the individual to inflict
          wrong in particular cases, this has yet a necessary correlative in
          the suffering of wrong of another individual, to whom it is a great
          pain. And because the reason which surveys the whole left the
          one-sided point of view of the individual to which it belongs, and
          freed itself for the moment from its dependence upon it, it saw the
          pleasure of an individual in inflicting wrong always outweighed by
          the relatively greater pain of the other who suffered the wrong;
          and it found further, that because here everything was left to
          chance, every one had to fear that the pleasure of conveniently
          inflicting wrong would far more rarely fall to his lot than the
          pain of enduring it. From this reason recognised that both in order
          to diminish the suffering which is everywhere disseminated, and as
          far as possible to divide it equally, the best and only means was
          to spare all the pain of suffering wrong by renouncing all the
          pleasure to be obtained by inflicting it. This means is the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">contract
          of the state</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">law</span></em>. It is easily conceived, and
          little by little carried out by the egoism, which, through the use
          of reason, proceeds methodically and forsakes its one-sided point
          of view. This origin of the state and of law I have indicated was
          already exhibited as such by Plato in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Republic.”</span> In fact, it is the essential and
          only origin, determined by the nature of the matter. Moreover, in
          no land can the state have ever had a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page443">[pg 443]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg443"></a> different origin, because it is just this
          mode of originating this aim that makes it a state. But it is a
          matter of indifference whether, in each particular nation, the
          condition which preceded it was that of a horde of savages
          independent of each other (anarchy), or that of a horde of slaves
          ruled at will by the stronger (despotism). In both cases there
          existed as yet no state; it first arose through that common
          agreement; and according as that agreement is more or less free
          from anarchy or despotism, the state is more or less perfect.
          Republics tend to anarchy, monarchies to despotism, and the mean of
          constitutional monarchy, which was therefore devised, tends to
          government by factions. In order to found a perfect state, we must
          begin by providing beings whose nature allows them always to
          sacrifice their own to the public good. Till then, however,
          something may be attained through the existence of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em>
          family whose good is quite inseparable from that of the country; so
          that, at least in matters of importance, it can never advance the
          one without the other. On this rests the power and the advantage of
          the hereditary monarchy.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now as ethics
          was concerned exclusively with right and wrong doing, and could
          accurately point out the limits of his action to whoever was
          resolved to do no wrong; politics, on the contrary, the theory of
          legislation, is exclusively concerned with the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">suffering</span></em> of wrong, and would
          never trouble itself with wrong-doing at all if it were not on
          account of its ever-necessary correlative, the suffering of wrong,
          which it always keeps in view as the enemy it opposes. Indeed, if
          it were possible to conceive an infliction of wrong with which no
          suffering of wrong on the part of another was connected, the state
          would, consistently, by no means prohibit it. And because in ethics
          the will, the disposition, is the object of consideration, and the
          only real thing, the firm will to do wrong, which is only
          restrained <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page444">[pg
          444]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg444"></a>
          and rendered ineffective by external might, and the actually
          committed wrong, are to it quite the same, and it condemns him who
          so wills as unjust at its tribunal. On the other hand, will and
          disposition, merely as such, do not concern the state at all, but
          only the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">deed</span></em> (whether it is merely
          attempted or carried out), on account of its correlative, the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">suffering</span></em> on the part of another.
          Thus for the state the deed, the event, is the only real; the
          disposition, the intention, is only investigated so far as the
          significance of the deed becomes known through it. Therefore the
          state will forbid no one to carry about in his thought murder and
          poison against another, so long as it knows certainly that the fear
          of the sword and the wheel will always restrain the effects of that
          will. The state has also by no means to eradicate the foolish
          purpose, the inclination to wrong-doing, the wicked disposition;
          but merely always to place beside every possible motive for doing a
          wrong a more powerful motive for leaving it undone in the
          inevitable punishment that will ensue. Therefore the criminal code
          is as complete a register as possible of motives against every
          criminal action that can possibly be imagined—both <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">in abstracto</span></span>, in order to make
          any case that occurs an application <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">in
          concreto</span></span>. Politics or legislation will therefore for
          this end borrow from that chapter of ethics which is the doctrine
          of right, and which, besides the inner significance of right and
          wrong, determines the exact limits between them. Yet it will only
          do so for the purpose of making use of its reverse side, and
          regarding all the limits which ethics lays down as not to be
          transgressed, if we are to avoid <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">doing</span></em>
          wrong, from the other side, as the limits which we must not allow
          others to transgress if we do not wish to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">suffer</span></em>
          wrong, and from which we have therefore a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">right</span></em>
          to drive others back. Therefore these limits are, as much as
          possible, from the passive side, barricaded by laws. It is evident
          that as an historian has very wittily been called an inverted
          prophet, the professor of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page445">[pg
          445]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg445"></a>
          law is an inverted moralist, and therefore law itself, in its
          proper sense, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the doctrine of the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">right</span></em>, which we ought to maintain,
          is inverted ethics in that chapter of it in which the rights are
          laid down which we ought not to violate. The concept of wrong and
          its negation, that of right, which is originally <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ethical</span></em>, becomes <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">juridical</span></em> by the transference of
          the starting-point from the active to the passive side, and thus by
          inversion. This, as well as Kant's theory of law, which very
          falsely deduces the institution of the state as a moral duty from
          his categorical imperative, has, even in the most recent times,
          repeatedly occasioned the very extraordinary error that the state
          is an institution for furthering morality; that it arises from the
          endeavour after this, and is, consequently, directed against
          egoism. As if the inward disposition, to which alone morality or
          immorality belongs, the externally free will, would allow itself to
          be modified from without and changed by influences exerted upon it!
          Still more perverse is the theory that the state is the condition
          of freedom in the moral sense, and in this way the condition of
          morality; for freedom lies beyond the phenomenon, and indeed beyond
          human arrangements. The state is, as we have said, so little
          directed against egoism in general and as such, that, on the
          contrary, it has sprung from egoism and exists only in its
          service—an egoism that well understands itself, proceeds
          methodically and forsakes the one-sided for the universal point of
          view, and so by addition is the common egoism of all. The state is
          thus instituted under the correct presupposition that pure
          morality, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, right action from moral
          grounds, is not to be expected; if this were not the case, it would
          itself be superfluous. Thus the state, which aims at well-being, is
          by no means directed against egoism, but only against the
          disadvantageous consequences which arise from the multiplicity of
          egoistic individuals, and reciprocally affect them all and disturb
          their well-being. Therefore it was already said by Aristotle (De.
          Rep. iii.): Τελος μεν ουν πολεως το ευ ζην; <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page446">[pg 446]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg446"></a> τουτο δε εστιν το ζῃν ευδαιμονως και
          καλως (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Finis civitatis est bene
          vivere, hoc autem est beate et pulchre vivere</span></span>).
          Hobbes also has accurately and excellently expounded this origin
          and end of the state; and that old first principle of all state
          policy, <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">salus publica prima lex
          esto</span></span>, indicates the same thing. If the state
          completely attains its end, it will produce the same outward result
          as if perfect justice of disposition prevailed everywhere. But the
          inner nature and origin of both phenomena will be the converse.
          Thus in the second case it would be that no one wished to
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">do</span></em> wrong, and in the first that no
          one wished to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">suffer</span></em> wrong, and the means
          appropriate to this end had been fully employed. Thus the same line
          may be drawn from opposite directions, and a beast of prey with a
          muzzle is as harmless as a graminivorous animal. But beyond this
          point the state cannot go. It cannot exhibit a phenomenon such as
          would spring from universal mutual well-wishing and love. For just
          as we found that from its nature it would not forbid the doing of a
          wrong which involved no corresponding suffering of wrong on the
          part of another, and prohibits all wrong-doing only because this is
          impossible; so conversely, in accordance with its tendency towards
          the well-being of all, it would very gladly take care that every
          benevolent action and work of human love should be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">experienced</span></em>, if it were not that
          these also have an inevitable correlative in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">performance</span></em> of acts of benevolence
          and works of love, and every member of the state would wish to
          assume the passive and none the active rôle, and there would be no
          reason for exacting the latter from one member of the state rather
          than from another. Accordingly only the negative, which is just the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">right</span></em>, not the positive, which has
          been comprehended under the name of obligations of love, or, less
          completely, duties, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">can be exacted by force</span></em>.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Legislation, as
          we have said, borrows the pure philosophy of right, or the doctrine
          of the nature and limits of right and wrong, from ethics, in order
          to apply it from <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page447">[pg
          447]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg447"></a>
          the reverse side to its own ends, which are different from those of
          ethics, and to institute positive legislation and the means of
          supporting it, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the state, in accordance
          with it. Positive legislation is thus the inverted application of
          the purely moral doctrine of right. This application may be made
          with reference to the peculiar relations and circumstances of a
          particular people. But only if the positive legislation is, in
          essential matters, throughout determined in accordance with the
          guidance of the pure theory of right, and for each of its
          propositions a ground can be established in the pure theory of
          right, is the legislation which has arisen a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">positive
          right</span></em> and the state a community <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">based upon
          right</span></em>, a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">state</span></em> in the proper meaning of the
          word, a morally permissible, not immoral institution. Otherwise the
          positive legislation is, on the contrary, the establishment of a
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">positive
          wrong</span></em>; it is itself an openly avowed enforced wrong.
          Such is every despotism, the constitution of most Mohammedan
          kingdoms; and indeed various parts of many constitutions are also
          of this kind; for example, serfdom, vassalage, and many such
          institutions. The pure theory of right or natural right—better,
          moral right—though always reversed, lies at the foundation of every
          just positive legislation, as pure mathematics lies at the
          foundation of every branch of applied mathematics. The most
          important points of the doctrine of right, as philosophy has to
          supply it for that end to legislation, are the following: 1. The
          explanation of the inner and real significance both of the origin
          of the conceptions of wrong and right, and of their application and
          position in ethics. 2. The deduction of the law of property. 3. The
          deduction of the moral validity of contracts; for this is the moral
          basis of the contract of the state. 4. The explanation of the
          origin and the aim of the state, of the relation of this aim to
          ethics, and of the intentional transference of the ethical doctrine
          of right, by reversing it, to legislation, in consequence of this
          relation. 5. The deduction of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page448">[pg 448]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg448"></a> right of punishment. The remaining content of
          the doctrine of right is mere application of these principles, mere
          accurate definition of the limits of right and wrong for all
          possible relations of life, which are consequently united and
          distributed under certain points of view and titles. In these
          special doctrines the books which treat of pure law are fairly at
          one; it is only in the principles that they differ much, for these
          are always connected with some philosophical system. In connection
          with our system, we have explained the first four of these
          principal points shortly and generally, yet definitely and
          distinctly, and it remains for us to speak in the same way of the
          right of punishment.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Kant makes the
          fundamentally false assertion that apart from the state there would
          be no complete right of property. It follows from our deduction, as
          given above, that even in a state of nature there is property with
          complete natural, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, moral right, which cannot
          be injured without wrong, but may without wrong be defended to the
          uttermost. On the other hand, it is certain that apart from the
          state there is no right of punishment. All right to punish is based
          upon the positive law alone, which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">before</span></em>
          the offence has determined a punishment for it, the threat of
          which, as a counter-motive, is intended to outweigh all possible
          motives for the offence. This positive law is to be regarded as
          sanctioned and recognised by all the members of the state. It is
          thus based upon a common contract which the members of the state
          are in duty bound to fulfil, and thus, on the one hand, to inflict
          the punishment, and, on the other hand, to endure it; thus the
          endurance of the punishment may with right be enforced.
          Consequently the immediate <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">end of punishment</span></em> is, in the
          particular case, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the fulfilment of the law as a
          contract</span></em>. But the one end of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">law</span></em> is
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">deterrence</span></em> from the infringement
          of the rights of others. For, in order that every one may be
          protected from suffering wrong, men have combined to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page449">[pg 449]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg449"></a> form a state, have renounced the doing
          of wrong, and assumed the task of maintaining the state. Thus the
          law and the fulfilment of it, the punishment, are essentially
          directed to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">future</span></em>, not to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">past</span></em>.
          This distinguishes <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">punishment</span></em> from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">revenge</span></em>; for the motives which
          instigate the latter are solely concerned with what has happened,
          and thus with the past as such. All requital of wrong by the
          infliction of pain, without any aim for the future, is revenge, and
          can have no other end than consolation for the suffering one has
          borne by the sight of the suffering one has inflicted upon another.
          This is wickedness and cruelty, and cannot be morally justified.
          Wrong which some one has inflicted upon me by no means entitles me
          to inflict wrong upon him. The requital of evil with evil without
          further intention is neither morally nor otherwise through any
          rational ground to be justified, and the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">jus talionis</span></span> set up as the
          absolute, final principle of the right of punishment, is
          meaningless. Therefore Kant's theory of punishment as mere requital
          for requital's sake is a completely groundless and perverse view.
          Yet it is always appearing in the writings of many jurists, under
          all kinds of lofty phrases, which amount to nothing but empty
          words, as: Through the punishment the crime is expiated or
          neutralised and abolished, and many such. But no man has the right
          to set himself up as a purely moral judge and requiter, and punish
          the misdeeds of another with pains which he inflicts upon him, and
          so to impose penance upon him for his sins. Nay, this would rather
          be the most presumptuous arrogance; and therefore the Bible says,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the
          Lord.”</span> But man has the right to care for the safety of
          society; and this can only be done by interdicting all actions
          which are denoted by the word <span class="tei tei-q">“criminal,”</span> in order to prevent them by means of
          counter-motives, which are the threatened punishments. And this
          threat can only be made effective by carrying it out when a case
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page450">[pg 450]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg450"></a> occurs in spite of
          it. Accordingly that the end of punishment, or more accurately of
          penal law, is the deterrence from crime, is a truth so generally
          recognised and indeed self-evident, that in England it is expressed
          in the very old form of indictment which is still served by the
          counsel for the Crown in criminal actions, for it concludes with
          the words, <span class="tei tei-q">“If this be proved, you, the
          said N. N., ought to be punished with pains of law, to deter others
          from the like crimes in all time coming.”</span> If a prince
          desires to extend mercy to a criminal who has justly been
          condemned, his Ministers will represent to him that, if he does,
          this crime will soon be repeated. An end for the future
          distinguishes punishment from revenge, and punishment only has this
          end when it is inflicted <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in fulfilment of a law</span></em>. It thus
          announces itself as inevitable in every future case, and thus the
          law obtains the power to deter, in which its end really consists.
          Now here a Kantian would inevitably reply that certainly according
          to this view the punished criminal would be used <span class="tei tei-q">“merely as a means.”</span> This proposition, so
          unweariedly repeated by all the Kantians, <span class="tei tei-q">“Man must always be treated as an end, never as a
          means,”</span> certainly sounds significant, and is therefore a
          very suitable proposition for those who like to have a formula
          which saves them all further thought; but looked at in the light,
          it is an exceedingly vague, indefinite assertion, which reaches its
          aim quite indirectly, requires to be explained, defined, and
          modified in every case of its application, and, if taken generally,
          is insufficient, meagre, and moreover problematical. The murderer
          who has been condemned to the punishment of death according to law
          must now, at any rate, and with complete right, be used as a mere
          means. For public security, the chief end of the state, is
          disturbed by him; indeed it is abolished if the law is not carried
          out. The murderer, his life, his person, must now be the means of
          fulfilling the law, and thereby of re-establishing the public
          security. And he is made such a means with perfect right,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page451">[pg 451]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg451"></a> in fulfilment of the
          contract of the state, which was entered into by him because he was
          a citizen, and in accordance with which, in order to enjoy security
          for his life, freedom, and property, he has pledged his life, his
          freedom, and his property for the security of all, which pledge has
          now been forfeited.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This theory of
          punishment which we have established, the theory which is directly
          supported by sound reason, is certainly in the main no new thought;
          but it is a thought which was almost supplanted by new errors, and
          therefore it was necessary to exhibit it as distinctly as possible.
          The same thing is in its essence contained in what Puffendorf says
          on the subject, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De Officio Hominis et
          Civis</span></span>”</span> (Bk. ii. chap. 12). Hobbes also agrees
          with it, <span class="tei tei-q">“Leviathan”</span> (chaps. 15-28).
          In our own day Feurbach is well known to have maintained it.
          Indeed, it occurs even in the utterances of the ancient
          philosophers. Plato expresses it clearly in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Protagoras”</span> (p. 114, edit. Bip.), also in the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Gorgias”</span> (p. 168), and lastly in
          the eleventh book of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Laws”</span> (p.
          165). Seneca expresses Plato's opinion and the theory of all
          punishment in the short sentence, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Nemo prudens punit, quia
          peccatum est; sed ne peccetur</span></span>”</span> (De Ira, i.
          16).</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus we have
          come to recognise in the state the means by which egoism endowed
          with reason seeks to escape from its own evil consequences which
          turn against itself, and now each promotes the well-being of all
          because he sees that his own well-being is involved in it. If the
          state attained its end completely, then to a certain extent
          something approaching to an Utopia might finally, by the removal of
          all kinds of evil, be brought about. For by the human powers united
          in it, it is able to make the rest of nature more and more
          serviceable. But as yet the state has always remained very far from
          this goal. And even if it attained to it, innumerable evils
          essential to all life would still keep it in suffering; and
          finally, if they were all removed, ennui would at once occupy
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page452">[pg 452]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg452"></a> every place they
          left. And besides, the strife of individuals is never completely
          abolished by the state, for it vexes in trifles when it is
          prohibited in greater things. Finally, Eris, happily expelled from
          within, turns to what is without; as the conflict of individuals,
          she is banished by the institution of the state; but she reappears
          from without as the war of nations, and now demands in bulk and at
          once, as an accumulated debt, the bloody sacrifice which by wise
          precautions has been denied her in the particular. And even
          supposing that all this were finally overcome and removed, by
          wisdom founded on the experience of thousands of years, at the end
          the result would be the actual over-population of the whole planet,
          the terrible evil of which only a bold imagination can now
          realise.<a href="#note_76" id="noteref_76" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">76</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 63. We have
          recognised <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">temporal justice</span></em>, which has its
          seat in the state, as requiting and punishing, and have seen that
          this only becomes justice through a reference to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">future</span></em>.
          For without this reference all punishing and requiting would be an
          outrage without justification, and indeed merely the addition of
          another evil to that which has already occurred, without meaning or
          significance. But it is quite otherwise with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">eternal
          justice</span></em>, which was referred to before, and which rules
          not the state but the world, is not dependent upon human
          institutions, is not subject to chance and deception, is not
          uncertain, wavering, and erring, but infallible, fixed, and sure.
          The conception of requital implies that of time; therefore
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">eternal
          justice</span></em> cannot be requital. Thus it cannot, like
          temporal justice, admit of respite and delay, and require time in
          order to triumph, equalising the evil deed by the evil consequences
          only by means of time. The punishment must here be so bound up with
          the offence that both are one.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page453">[pg 453]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg453"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now that such an
          eternal justice really lies in the nature of the world will soon
          become completely evident to whoever has grasped the whole of the
          thought which we have hitherto been developing.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The world, in
          all the multiplicity of its parts and forms, is the manifestation,
          the objectivity, of the one will to live. Existence itself, and the
          kind of existence, both as a collective whole and in every part,
          proceeds from the will alone. The will is free, the will is
          almighty. The will appears in everything, just as it determines
          itself in itself and outside time. The world is only the mirror of
          this willing; and all finitude, all suffering, all miseries, which
          it contains, belong to the expression of that which the will wills,
          are as they are because the will so wills. Accordingly with perfect
          right every being supports existence in general, and also the
          existence of its species and its peculiar individuality, entirely
          as it is and in circumstances as they are, in a world such as it
          is, swayed by chance and error, transient, ephemeral, and
          constantly suffering; and in all that it experiences, or indeed can
          experience, it always gets its <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page454">[pg 454]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg454"></a> due. For the will belongs to it; and as the
          will is, so is the world. Only this world itself can bear the
          responsibility of its own existence and nature—no other; for by
          what means could another have assumed it? Do we desire to know what
          men, morally considered, are worth as a whole and in general, we
          have only to consider their fate as a whole and in general. This is
          want, wretchedness, affliction, misery, and death. Eternal justice
          reigns; if they were not, as a whole, worthless, their fate, as a
          whole, would not be so sad. In this sense we may say, the world
          itself is the judgment of the world. If we could lay all the misery
          of the world in one scale of the balance, and all the guilt of the
          world in the other, the needle would certainly point to the
          centre.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Certainly,
          however, the world does not exhibit itself to the knowledge of the
          individual as such, developed for the service of the will, as it
          finally reveals itself to the inquirer as the objectivity of the
          one and only will to live, which he himself is. But the sight of
          the uncultured individual is clouded, as the Hindus say, by the
          veil of Mâyâ. He sees not the thing-in-itself but the phenomenon in
          time and space, the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium
          individuationis</span></span>, and in the other forms of the
          principle of sufficient reason. And in this form of his limited
          knowledge he sees not the inner nature of things, which is one, but
          its phenomena as separated, disunited, innumerable, very different,
          and indeed opposed. For to him pleasure appears as one thing and
          pain as quite another thing: one man as a tormentor and a murderer,
          another as a martyr and a victim; wickedness as one thing and evil
          as another. He sees one man live in joy, abundance, and pleasure,
          and even at his door another die miserably of want and cold. Then
          he asks, Where is the retribution? And he himself, in the vehement,
          pressure of will which is his origin and his nature, seizes upon
          the pleasures and enjoyments of life, firmly <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page455">[pg 455]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg455"></a> embraces them, and knows not that by
          this very act of his will he seizes and hugs all those pains and
          sorrows at the sight of which he shudders. He sees the ills and he
          sees the wickedness in the world, but far from knowing that both of
          these are but different sides of the manifestation of the one will
          to live, he regards them as very different, and indeed quite
          opposed, and often seeks to escape by wickedness, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          by causing the suffering of another, from ills, from the suffering
          of his own individuality, for he is involved in the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium individuationis</span></span>,
          deluded by the veil of Mâyâ. Just as a sailor sits in a boat
          trusting to his frail barque in a stormy sea, unbounded in every
          direction, rising and falling with the howling mountainous waves;
          so in the midst of a world of sorrows the individual man sits
          quietly, supported by and trusting to the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium individuationis</span></span>, or
          the way in which the individual knows things as phenomena. The
          boundless world, everywhere full of suffering in the infinite past,
          in the infinite future, is strange to him, indeed is to him but a
          fable; his ephemeral person, his extensionless present, his
          momentary satisfaction, this alone has reality for him; and he does
          all to maintain this, so long as his eyes are not opened by a
          better knowledge. Till then, there lives only in the inmost depths
          of his consciousness a very obscure presentiment that all that is
          after all not really so strange to him, but has a connection with
          him, from which the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium
          individuationis</span></span> cannot protect him. From this
          presentiment arises that ineradicable <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">awe</span></em>
          common to all men (and indeed perhaps even to the most sensible of
          the brutes) which suddenly seizes them if by any chance they become
          puzzled about the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium
          individuationis</span></span>, because the principle of sufficient
          reason in some one of its forms seems to admit of an exception. For
          example, if it seems as if some change took place without a cause,
          or some one who is dead appears again, or if in any <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page456">[pg 456]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg456"></a> other way the past or the future
          becomes present or the distant becomes near. The fearful terror at
          anything of the kind is founded on the fact that they suddenly
          become puzzled about the forms of knowledge of the phenomenon,
          which alone separate their own individuality from the rest of the
          world. But even this separation lies only in the phenomenon, and
          not in the thing-in-itself; and on this rests eternal justice. In
          fact, all temporal happiness stands, and all prudence proceeds,
          upon ground that is undermined. They defend the person from
          accidents and supply its pleasures; but the person is merely
          phenomenon, and its difference from other individuals, and
          exemption from the sufferings which they endure, rests merely in
          the form of the phenomenon, the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium individuationis</span></span>.
          According to the true nature of things, every one has all the
          suffering of the world as his own, and indeed has to regard all
          merely possible suffering as for him actual, so long as he is the
          fixed will to live, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, asserts life with all his
          power. For the knowledge that sees through the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium individuationis</span></span>, a
          happy life in time, the gift of chance or won by prudence, amid the
          sorrows of innumerable others, is only the dream of a beggar in
          which he is a king, but from which he must awake and learn from
          experience that only a fleeting illusion had separated him from the
          suffering of his life.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Eternal justice
          withdraws itself from the vision that is involved in the knowledge
          which follows the principle of sufficient reason in the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium individuationis</span></span>; such
          vision misses it altogether unless it vindicates it in some way by
          fictions. It sees the bad, after misdeeds and cruelties of every
          kind, live in happiness and leave the world unpunished. It sees the
          oppressed drag out a life full of suffering to the end without an
          avenger, a requiter appearing. But that man only will grasp and
          comprehend eternal justice who raises himself above the knowledge
          that proceeds under the guidance of the principle of sufficient
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page457">[pg 457]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg457"></a> reason, bound to the
          particular thing, and recognises the Ideas, sees through the
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium individuationis</span></span>, and
          becomes conscious that the forms of the phenomenon do not apply to
          the thing-in-itself. Moreover, he alone, by virtue of the same
          knowledge, can understand the true nature of virtue, as it will
          soon disclose itself to us in connection with the present inquiry,
          although for the practice of virtue this knowledge in the abstract
          is by no means demanded. Thus it becomes clear to whoever has
          attained to the knowledge referred to, that because the will is the
          in-itself of all phenomena, the misery which is awarded to others
          and that which he experiences himself, the bad and the evil, always
          concerns only that one inner being which is everywhere the same,
          although the phenomena in which the one and the other exhibits
          itself exist as quite different individuals, and are widely
          separated by time and space. He sees that the difference between
          him who inflicts the suffering and him who must bear it is only the
          phenomenon, and does not concern the thing-in-itself, for this is
          the will living in both, which here, deceived by the knowledge
          which is bound to its service, does not recognise itself, and
          seeking an increased happiness in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> of
          its phenomena, produces great suffering in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">another</span></em>, and thus, in the pressure
          of excitement, buries its teeth in its own flesh, not knowing that
          it always injures only itself, revealing in this form, through the
          medium of individuality, the conflict with itself which it bears in
          its inner nature. The inflicter of suffering and the sufferer are
          one. The former errs in that he believes he is not a partaker in
          the suffering; the latter, in that he believes he is not a partaker
          in the guilt. If the eyes of both were opened, the inflicter of
          suffering would see that he lives in all that suffers pain in the
          wide world, and which, if endowed with reason, in vain asks why it
          was called into existence for such great suffering, its desert of
          which it does not understand. And the sufferer would see that all
          the wickedness <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page458">[pg
          458]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg458"></a>
          which is or ever was committed in the world proceeds from that will
          which constitutes <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">his</span></em> own nature also, appears also
          in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">him</span></em>, and that through this
          phenomenon and its assertion he has taken upon himself all the
          sufferings which proceed from such a will and bears them as his
          due, so long as he is this will. From this knowledge speaks the
          profound poet Calderon in <span class="tei tei-q">“Life a

          upon it? Calderon has merely expressed in these lines the Christian
          dogma of original sin.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The living
          knowledge of eternal justice, of the balance that inseparably binds
          together the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">malum culpæ</span></span>
          with the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">malum pœnæ</span></span>,
          demands the complete transcending of individuality and the
          principle of its possibility. Therefore it will always remain
          unattainable to the majority of men, as will also be the case with
          the pure and distinct knowledge of the nature of all virtue, which
          is akin to it, and which we are about to explain. Accordingly the
          wise ancestors of the Hindu people have directly expressed it in
          the Vedas, which are only allowed to the three regenerate castes,
          or in their esoteric teaching, so far at any rate as conception and
          language comprehend it, and their method of exposition, which
          always remains pictorial and even rhapsodical, admits; but in the
          religion of the people, or exoteric teaching, they only communicate
          it by means of myths. The direct exposition we find in the Vedas,
          the fruit of the highest human knowledge and wisdom, the kernel of
          which has at last reached us in the Upanishads as the greatest gift
          of this century. It is expressed in various <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page459">[pg 459]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg459"></a> ways, but especially by making all the
          beings in the world, living and lifeless, pass successively before
          the view of the student, and pronouncing over every one of them
          that word which has become a formula, and as such has been called
          the Mahavakya: Tatoumes,—more correctly, Tat twam asi,—which means,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“This thou art.”</span><a href="#note_77" id="noteref_77" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">77</span></span></a> But
          for the people, that great truth, so far as in their limited
          condition they could comprehend it, was translated into the form of
          knowledge which follows the principle of sufficient reason. This
          form of knowledge is indeed, from its nature, quite incapable of
          apprehending that truth pure and in itself, and even stands in
          contradiction to it, yet in the form of a myth it received a
          substitute for it which was sufficient as a guide for conduct. For
          the myth enables the method of knowledge, in accordance with the
          principle of sufficient reason, to comprehend by figurative
          representation the ethical significance of conduct, which itself is
          ever foreign to it. This is the aim of all systems of religion, for
          as a whole they are the mythical clothing of the truth which is
          unattainable to the uncultured human intellect. In this sense this
          myth might, in Kant's language, be called a postulate of the
          practical reason; but regarded as such, it has the great advantage
          that it contains absolutely no elements but such as lie before our
          eyes in the course of actual experience, and can therefore support
          all its conceptions with perceptions. What is here referred to is
          the myth of the transmigration of souls. It teaches that all
          sufferings which in life one inflicts upon other beings must be
          expiated in a subsequent life in this world, through precisely the
          same sufferings; and this extends so far, that he who only kills a
          brute must, some time in endless time, be born as the same kind of
          brute and suffer the same death. It teaches that wicked conduct
          involves a future life in this world in suffering and despised
          creatures, and, accordingly, that one will then be born again in
          lower castes, or as <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page460">[pg
          460]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg460"></a> a
          woman, or as a brute, as Pariah or Tschandala, as a leper, or as a
          crocodile, and so forth. All the pains which the myth threatens it
          supports with perceptions from actual life, through suffering
          creatures which do not know how they have merited their misery, and
          it does not require to call in the assistance of any other hell. As
          a reward, on the other hand, it promises re-birth in better, nobler
          forms, as Brahmans, wise men, or saints. The highest reward, which
          awaits the noblest deeds and the completest resignation, which is
          also given to the woman who in seven successive lives has
          voluntarily died on the funeral pile of her husband, and not less
          to the man whose pure mouth has never uttered a single lie,—this
          reward the myth can only express negatively in the language of this
          world by the promise, which is so often repeated, that they shall
          never be born again, <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Non adsumes iterum
          existentiam apparentem</span></span>; or, as the Buddhists, who
          recognise neither Vedas nor castes, express it, <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou shalt attain to Nirvâna,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          to a state in which four things no longer exist—birth, age,
          sickness, and death.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Never has a myth
          entered, and never will one enter, more closely into the
          philosophical truth which is attainable to so few than this
          primitive doctrine of the noblest and most ancient nation. Broken
          up as this nation now is into many parts, this myth yet reigns as
          the universal belief of the people, and has the most decided
          influence upon life to-day, as four thousand years ago. Therefore
          Pythagoras and Plato have seized with admiration on that
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ne plus ultra</span></span> of mythical
          representation, received it from India or Egypt, honoured it, made
          use of it, and, we know not how far, even believed it. We, on the
          contrary, now send the Brahmans English clergymen and evangelical
          linen-weavers to set them right out of sympathy, and to show them
          that they are created out of nothing, and ought thankfully to
          rejoice in the fact. But it is just the same as if we fired a
          bullet against a cliff. In India our religions will never take
          root. The ancient <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page461">[pg
          461]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg461"></a>
          wisdom of the human race will not be displaced by what happened in
          Galilee. On the contrary, Indian philosophy streams back to Europe,
          and will produce a fundamental change in our knowledge and
          thought.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 64. From our
          exposition of eternal justice, which is not mythical but
          philosophical, we will now proceed to the kindred investigation of
          the ethical significance of conduct and of conscience, which is the
          merely felt knowledge of that significance. But first I wish at
          this point to draw attention to two peculiarities of human nature,
          that might help to make clear how the nature of that eternal
          justice, and the unity and identity of the will in all its
          phenomena upon which it rests, is known to every one, at least as
          an obscure feeling.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When a bad deed
          has been done, it affords satisfaction not only to the sufferer,
          who for the most part feels the desire of revenge, but also to the
          perfectly indifferent spectator, to see that he who caused another
          pain suffers himself a like measure of pain; and this quite
          independently of the end which we have shown the state has in view
          in punishment, and which is the foundation of penal law. It seems
          to me that what expresses itself here is nothing but the
          consciousness of that eternal justice, which is, nevertheless, at
          once misunderstood and falsified by the unenlightened mind, for,
          involved in the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium
          individuationis</span></span>, it produces an amphiboly of the
          concepts and demands from the phenomenon what only belongs to the
          thing in itself. It does not see how far in themselves the offender
          and the offended are one, and that it is the same being which, not
          recognising itself in its own manifestation, bears both the pain
          and the guilt, but it desires rather to see the pain also in the
          particular individual to whom the guilt belongs. Therefore, most
          persons would demand that a man who had a very high degree of
          wickedness which might yet occur in many others, only not matched
          with other qualities such as are found in him, a man who also far
          surpassed <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page462">[pg
          462]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg462"></a>
          others by extraordinary intellectual powers, and who inflicted
          unspeakable sufferings upon millions of others—for example, as a
          conqueror,—most persons, I say, would demand that such a man should
          at some time and in some place expiate all these sufferings by a
          like amount of pain; for they do not recognise how in themselves
          the inflicter of suffering and the sufferers are one, and that it
          is the same will through which the latter exist and live which also
          appears in the former, and just through him attains to a distinct
          revelation of its nature, and which likewise suffers both in the
          oppressed and the oppressor; and indeed in the latter in a greater
          measure, as the consciousness has attained a higher degree of
          clearness and distinctness and the will has greater vehemence. But
          that the deeper knowledge, which is no longer involved in the
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium individuationis</span></span>, from
          which all virtue and nobleness proceed, no longer retains the
          disposition which demands requital, is shown by the Christian
          ethics, which absolutely forbids all requital of evil with evil,
          and allows eternal justice to proceed in the sphere of the
          thing-in-itself, which is different from that of the phenomenon.
          (<span class="tei tei-q">“Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith
          the Lord,”</span>—Rom. xii. 19.)</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A much more
          striking, but also a much rarer, characteristic of human nature,
          which expresses that desire to draw eternal justice into the
          province of experience, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, of individuality, and at
          the same time indicates a felt consciousness that, as I have
          expressed it above, the will to live conducts at its own cost the
          great tragedy and comedy, and that the same one will lives in all
          manifestations,—such a characteristic, I say, is the following. We
          sometimes see a man so deeply moved by a great injury which he has
          experienced, or, it may be, only witnessed, that he deliberately
          and irretrievably stakes his own life in order to take vengeance on
          the perpetrator of that wrong. We see him seek for some mighty
          oppressor through long years, murder him at last, and then himself
          die on the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page463">[pg
          463]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg463"></a>
          scaffold, as he had foreseen, and often, it may be, did not seek to
          avoid, for his life had value for him only as a means of vengeance.
          We find examples of this especially among the Spaniards.<a href="#note_78" id="noteref_78" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">78</span></span></a> If,
          now, we consider the spirit of that desire for retribution
          carefully, we find that it is very different from common revenge,
          which seeks to mitigate the suffering, endured by the sight of the
          suffering inflicted; indeed, we find that what it aims at deserves
          to be called, not so much revenge as punishment. For in it there
          really lies the intention of an effect upon the future through the
          example, and that without any selfish aim, either for the avenging
          person, for it costs him his life, or for a society which secures
          its own safety by laws. For that punishment is carried out by
          individuals, not by the state, nor is it in fulfilment of a law,
          but, on the contrary, always concerns a deed which the state either
          would not or could not punish, and the punishment of which it
          condemns. It seems to me that the indignation which carries such a
          man so far beyond the limits of all self-love springs from the
          deepest consciousness that he himself is the whole will to live,
          which appears in all beings through all time, and that therefore
          the most distant future belongs to him just as the present, and
          cannot be indifferent to him. Asserting this will, he yet desires
          that in the drama which represents its nature no such fearful wrong
          shall ever appear again, and wishes to frighten ever future
          wrong-doer by the example of a vengeance against which there is no
          means of defence, since the avenger is not deterred by the fear of
          death. The will to live, though still asserting itself, does not
          here depend any longer upon the particular phenomenon, the
          individual, but comprehends the Idea of man, and wishes to keep its
          manifestation pure from such a fearful and shocking wrong. It is a
          rare, very significant, and even sublime <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page464">[pg 464]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg464"></a> trait of character through which the
          individual sacrifices himself by striving to make himself the arm
          of eternal justice, of the true nature of which he is yet
          ignorant.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 65. In all the
          preceding investigations of human action, we have been leading up
          to the final investigation, and have to a considerable extent
          lightened the task of raising to abstract and philosophical
          clearness, and exhibiting as a branch of our central thought that
          special ethical significance of action which in life is with
          perfect understanding denoted by the words <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">good</span></em>
          and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">bad</span></em>.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">First, however,
          I wish to trace back to their real meaning those conceptions of
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">good</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">bad</span></em>
          which have been treated by the philosophical writers of the day,
          very extraordinarily, as simple conceptions, and thus incapable of
          analysis; so that the reader may not remain involved in the
          senseless delusion that they contain more than is actually the
          case, and express in and for themselves all that is here necessary.
          I am in a position to do this because in ethics I am no more
          disposed to take refuge behind the word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">good</span></em>
          than formerly behind the words <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">beautiful</span></em>
          and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">true</span></em>, in order that by the adding
          a <span class="tei tei-q">“ness,”</span> which at the present day
          is supposed to have a special σεμνοτης, and therefore to be of
          assistance in various cases, and by assuming an air of solemnity, I
          might induce the belief that by uttering three such words I had
          done more than denote three very wide and abstract, and
          consequently empty conceptions, of very different origin and
          significance. Who is there, indeed, who has made himself acquainted
          with the books of our own day to whom these three words, admirable
          as are the things to which they originally refer, have not become
          an aversion after he has seen for the thousandth time how those who
          are least capable of thinking believe that they have only to utter
          these three words with open mouth and the air of an intelligent
          sheep, in order to have spoken the greatest wisdom?</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The explanation
          of the concept <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">true</span></em> has already been <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page465">[pg 465]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg465"></a> given in the essay on the principle of
          sufficient reason, chap. v. § 29 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">et seq.</span></span>
          The content of the concept <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">beautiful</span></em> found for the first time
          its proper explanation through the whole of the Third Book of the
          present work. We now wish to discover the significance of the
          concept <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">good</span></em>, which can be done with very
          little trouble. This concept is essentially relative, and signifies
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the
          conformity of an object to any definite effort of the
          will</span></em>. Accordingly everything that corresponds to the
          will in any of its expressions and fulfils its end is thought
          through the concept <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">good</span></em>, however different such
          things may be in other respects. Thus we speak of good eating, good
          roads, good weather, good weapons, good omens, and so on; in short,
          we call everything good that is just as we wish it to be; and
          therefore that may be good in the eyes of one man which is just the
          reverse in those of another. The conception of the good divides
          itself into two sub-species—that of the direct and present
          satisfaction of any volition, and that of its indirect satisfaction
          which has reference to the future, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          the agreeable and the useful. The conception of the opposite, so
          long as we are speaking of unconscious existence, is expressed by
          the word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">bad</span></em>, more rarely and abstractly by
          the word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">evil</span></em>, which thus denotes
          everything that does not correspond to any effort of the will. Like
          all other things that can come into relation to the will, men who
          are favourable to the ends which happen to be desired, who further
          and befriend them, are called good, in the same sense, and always
          with that relative limitation, which shows itself, for example, in
          the expression, <span class="tei tei-q">“I find this good, but you
          don't.”</span> Those, however, who are naturally disposed not to
          hinder the endeavours of others, but rather to assist them, and who
          are thus consistently helpful, benevolent, friendly, and
          charitable, are called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">good</span></em> men, on account of this
          relation of their conduct to the will of others in general. In the
          case of conscious beings (brutes and men) the contrary conception
          is denoted in German, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page466">[pg
          466]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg466"></a>
          and, within the last hundred years or so, in French also, by a
          different word from that which is used in speaking of unconscious
          existence; in German, <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">böse</span></span>;
          in French, <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">méchant</span></span>; while
          in almost all other languages this distinction does not exist; and
          κακος, <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">malus</span></span>,
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">cattivo</span></span>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">bad</span></em>,
          are used of men, as of lifeless things, which are opposed to the
          ends of a definite individual will. Thus, having started entirely
          from the passive element in the good, the inquiry could only
          proceed later to the active element, and investigate the conduct of
          the man who is called good, no longer with reference to others, but
          to himself; specially setting itself the task of explaining both
          the purely objective respect which such conduct produces in others,
          and the peculiar contentment with himself which it clearly produces
          in the man himself, since he purchases it with sacrifices of
          another kind; and also, on the other hand, the inner pain which
          accompanies the bad disposition, whatever outward advantages it
          brings to him who entertains it. It was from this source that the
          ethical systems, both the philosophical and those which are
          supported by systems of religion, took their rise. Both seek
          constantly in some way or other to connect happiness with virtue,
          the former either by means of the principle of contradiction or
          that of sufficient reason, and thus to make happiness either
          identical with or the consequence of virtue, always sophistically;
          the latter, by asserting the existence of other worlds than that
          which alone can be known to experience.<a href="#note_79" id="noteref_79" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">79</span></span></a> In our
          system, on the contrary, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page467">[pg
          467]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg467"></a>
          virtue will show itself, not as a striving after happiness, that
          is, well-being and life, but as an effort in quite an opposite
          direction.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It follows from
          what has been said above, that the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">good</span></em>
          is, according to its concept, των πρως τι; thus every good is
          essentially relative, for its being consists in its relation to a
          desiring will. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Absolute good</span></em> is, therefore, a
          contradiction in terms; highest good, <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">summum bonum</span></span>, really signifies
          the same thing—a final satisfaction of the will, after which no new
          desire could arise,—a last motive, the attainment of which would
          afford enduring satisfaction of the will. But, according to the
          investigations which have already been conducted in this Fourth
          Book, such a consummation is not even thinkable. The will can just
          as little cease from willing altogether on account of some
          particular satisfaction, as time can end or begin; for it there is
          no such thing as a permanent fulfilment which shall completely and
          for ever satisfy its craving. It is the vessel of the Danaides; for
          it there is no highest good, no absolute good, but always a merely
          temporary good. If, however, we wish to give an honorary position,
          as it were emeritus, to an old expression, which from custom we do
          not like to discard altogether, we may, metaphorically and
          figuratively, call the complete self-effacement and denial of the
          will, the true absence of will, which alone for ever stills and
          silences its struggle, alone gives that contentment which can never
          again be disturbed, alone redeems the world, and which we shall now
          soon consider at the close of our whole investigation—the
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page468">[pg 468]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg468"></a> absolute good, the
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">summum bonum</span></span>—and regard it as
          the only radical cure of the disease of which all other means are
          only palliations or anodynes. In this sense the Greek τελος and
          also <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">finis bonorum</span></span>
          correspond to the thing still better. So much for the words
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">good</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">bad</span></em>;
          now for the thing itself.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If a man is
          always disposed to do <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">wrong</span></em> whenever the opportunity
          presents itself, and there is no external power to restrain him, we
          call him <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">bad</span></em>. According to our doctrine of
          wrong, this means that such a man does not merely assert the will
          to live as it appears in his own body, but in this assertion goes
          so far that he denies the will which appears in other individuals.
          This is shown by the fact that he desires their powers for the
          service of his own will, and seeks to destroy their existence when
          they stand in the way of its efforts. The ultimate source of this
          is a high degree of egoism, the nature of which has been already
          explained. Two things are here apparent. In the first place, that
          in such a man an excessively vehement will to live expresses
          itself, extending far beyond the assertion of his own body; and, in
          the second place, that his knowledge, entirely given up to the
          principle of sufficient reason and involved in the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium individuationis</span></span>,
          cannot get beyond the difference which this latter principle
          establishes between his own person and every one else. Therefore he
          seeks his own well-being alone, completely indifferent to that of
          all others, whose existence is to him altogether foreign and
          divided from his own by a wide gulf, and who are indeed regarded by
          him as mere masks with no reality behind them. And these two
          qualities are the constituent elements of the bad character.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This great
          intensity of will is in itself and directly a constant source of
          suffering. In the first place, because all volition as such arises
          from want; that is, suffering. (Therefore, as will be remembered,
          from the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page469">[pg
          469]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg469"></a>
          Third Book, the momentary cessation of all volition, which takes
          place whenever we give ourselves up to æsthetic contemplation, as
          pure will-less subject of knowledge, the correlative of the Idea,
          is one of the principal elements in our pleasure in the beautiful.)
          Secondly, because, through the causal connection of things, most of
          our desires must remain unfulfilled, and the will is oftener
          crossed than satisfied, and therefore much intense volition carries
          with it much intense suffering. For all suffering is simply
          unfulfilled and crossed volition; and even the pain of the body
          when it is injured or destroyed is as such only possible through
          the fact that the body is nothing but the will itself become
          object. Now on this account, because much intense suffering is
          inseparable from much intense volition, very bad men bear the stamp
          of inward suffering in the very expression of the countenance; even
          when they have attained every external happiness, they always look
          unhappy so long as they are not transported by some momentary
          ecstasy and are not dissembling. From this inward torment, which is
          absolutely and directly essential to them, there finally proceeds
          that delight in the suffering of others which does not spring from
          mere egoism, but is disinterested, and which constitutes <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">wickedness</span></em> proper, rising to the
          pitch of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cruelty</span></em>. For this the suffering of
          others is not a means for the attainment of the ends of its own
          will, but an end in itself. The more definite explanation of this
          phenomenon is as follows:—Since man is a manifestation of will
          illuminated by the clearest knowledge, he is always contrasting the
          actual and felt satisfaction of his will with the merely possible
          satisfaction of it which knowledge presents to him. Hence arises
          envy: every privation is infinitely increased by the enjoyment of
          others, and relieved by the knowledge that others also suffer the
          same privation. Those ills which are common to all and inseparable
          from human life trouble us little, just as those which belong to
          the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page470">[pg 470]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg470"></a> climate, to the
          whole country. The recollection of greater sufferings than our own
          stills our pain; the sight of the sufferings of others soothes our
          own. If, now, a man is filled with an exceptionally intense
          pressure of will,—if with burning eagerness he seeks to accumulate
          everything to slake the thirst of his egoism, and thus experiences,
          as he inevitably must, that all satisfaction is merely apparent,
          that the attained end never fulfils the promise of the desired
          object, the final appeasing of the fierce pressure of will, but
          that when fulfilled the wish only changes its form, and now
          torments him in a new one; and indeed that if at last all wishes
          are exhausted, the pressure of will itself remains without any
          conscious motive, and makes itself known to him with fearful pain
          as a feeling of terrible desolation and emptiness; if from all
          this, which in the case of the ordinary degrees of volition is only
          felt in a small measure, and only produces the ordinary degree of
          melancholy, in the case of him who is a manifestation of will
          reaching the point of extraordinary wickedness, there necessarily
          springs an excessive inward misery, an eternal unrest, an incurable
          pain; he seeks indirectly the alleviation which directly is denied
          him,—seeks to mitigate his own suffering by the sight of the
          suffering of others, which at the same time he recognises as an
          expression of his power. The suffering of others now becomes for
          him an end in itself, and is a spectacle in which he delights; and
          thus arises the phenomenon of pure cruelty, blood-thirstiness,
          which history exhibits so often in the Neros and Domitians, in the
          African Deis, in Robespierre, and the like.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The desire of
          revenge is closely related to wickedness. It recompenses evil with
          evil, not with reference to the future, which is the character of
          punishment, but merely on account of what has happened, what is
          past, as such, thus disinterestedly, not as a means, but as an end,
          in order to revel in the torment which the avenger himself has
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page471">[pg 471]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg471"></a> inflicted on the
          offender. What distinguishes revenge from pure wickedness, and to
          some extent excuses it, is an appearance of justice. For if the
          same act, which is now revenge, were to be done legally, that is,
          according to a previously determined and known rule, and in a
          society which had sanctioned this rule, it would be punishment, and
          thus justice.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Besides the
          suffering which has been described, and which is inseparable from
          wickedness, because it springs from the same root, excessive
          vehemence of will, another specific pain quite different from this
          is connected with wickedness, which is felt in the case of every
          bad action, whether it be merely injustice proceeding from egoism
          or pure wickedness, and according to the length of its duration is
          called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the sting of conscience</span></em> or
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">remorse</span></em>. Now, whoever remembers
          and has present in his mind the content of the preceding portion of
          this Fourth Book, and especially the truth explained at the
          beginning of it, that life itself is always assured to the will to
          live, as its mere copy or mirror, and also the exposition of
          eternal justice, will find that the sting of conscience can have no
          other meaning than the following, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          its content, abstractly expressed, is what follows, in which two
          parts are distinguished, which again, however, entirely coincide,
          and must be thought as completely united.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">However closely
          the veil of Mâyâ may envelop the mind of the bad man, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          however firmly he may be involved in the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium individuationis</span></span>,
          according to which he regards his person as absolutely different
          and separated by a wide gulf from all others, a knowledge to which
          he clings with all his might, as it alone suits and supports his
          egoism, so that knowledge is almost always corrupted by will, yet
          there arises in the inmost depths of his consciousness the secret
          presentiment that such an order of things is only phenomenal, and
          that their real constitution is quite different. He has a dim
          foreboding that, however much time and space may separate
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page472">[pg 472]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg472"></a> him from other
          individuals and the innumerable miseries which they suffer, and
          even suffer through him, and may represent them as quite foreign to
          him, yet in themselves, and apart from the idea and its forms, it
          is the one will to live appearing in them all, which here failing
          to recognise itself, turns its weapons against itself, and, by
          seeking increased happiness in one of its phenomena, imposes the
          greatest suffering upon another. He dimly sees that he, the bad
          man, is himself this whole will; that consequently he is not only
          the inflicter of pain but also the endurer of it, from whose
          suffering he is only separated and exempted by an illusive dream,
          the form of which is space and time, which, however, vanishes away;
          that he must in reality pay for the pleasure with the pain, and
          that all suffering which he only knows as possible really concerns
          him as the will to live, inasmuch as the possible and actual, the
          near and the distant in time and space, are only different for the
          knowledge of the individual, only by means of the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium individuationis</span></span>, not
          in themselves. This is the truth which mythically, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          adapted to the principle of sufficient reason, and so translated
          into the form of the phenomenal, is expressed in the transmigration
          of souls. Yet it has its purest expression, free from all foreign
          admixture, in that obscurely felt yet inconsolable misery called
          remorse. But this springs also from a second immediate knowledge,
          which is closely bound to the first—the knowledge of the strength
          with which the will to live asserts itself in the wicked
          individual, which extends far beyond his own individual phenomenon,
          to the absolute denial of the same will appearing in other
          individuals. Consequently the inward horror of the wicked man at
          his own deed, which he himself tries to conceal, contains, besides
          that presentment of the nothingness, the mere illusiveness of the
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium individuationis</span></span>, and
          of the distinction established by it between him and others; also
          the knowledge of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page473">[pg
          473]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg473"></a>
          vehemence of his own will, the intensity with which he has seized
          upon life and attached himself closely to it, even that life whose
          terrible side he sees before him in the misery of those who are
          oppressed by him, and with which he is yet so firmly united, that
          just on this account the greatest atrocity proceeds from him
          himself, as a means for the fuller assertion of his own will. He
          recognises himself as the concentrated manifestation of the will to
          live, feels to what degree he is given up to life, and with it also
          to innumerable sufferings which are essential to it, for it has
          infinite time and infinite space to abolish the distinction between
          the possible and the actual, and to change all the sufferings which
          as yet are merely <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">known</span></em> to him into sufferings he
          has <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">experienced</span></em>. The millions of years
          of constant rebirth certainly exist, like the whole past and
          future, only in conception; occupied time, the form of the
          phenomenon of the will, is only the present, and for the individual
          time is ever new: it seems to him always as if he had newly come
          into being. For life is inseparable from the will to live, and the
          only form of life is the present. Death (the repetition of the
          comparison must be excused) is like the setting of the sun, which
          is only apparently swallowed up by the night, but in reality,
          itself the source of all light, burns without intermission, brings
          new days to new worlds, is always rising and always setting.
          Beginning and end only concern the individual through time, the
          form of the phenomenon for the idea. Outside time lies only the
          will, Kant's thing-in-itself, and its adequate objectification, the
          Idea of Plato. Therefore suicide affords no escape; what every one
          in his inmost consciousness <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">wills</span></em>, that must he <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">be</span></em>; and
          what every one <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></em>, that he <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">wills</span></em>.
          Thus, besides the merely felt knowledge of the illusiveness and
          nothingness of the forms of the idea which separate individuals, it
          is the self-knowledge of one's own will and its degree that gives
          the sting to conscience. The course of life draws <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page474">[pg 474]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg474"></a> the image of the empirical character,
          whose original is the intelligible character, and horrifies the
          wicked man by this image. He is horrified all the same whether the
          image is depicted in large characters, so that the world shares his
          horror, or in such small ones that he alone sees it, for it only
          concerns him directly. The past would be a matter of indifference,
          and could not pain the conscience if the character did not feel
          itself free from all time and unalterable by it, so long as it does
          not deny itself. Therefore things which are long past still weigh
          on the conscience. The prayer, <span class="tei tei-q">“Lead me not
          into temptation,”</span> means, <span class="tei tei-q">“Let me not
          see what manner of person I am.”</span> In the might with which the
          bad man asserts life, and which exhibits itself to him in the
          sufferings which he inflicts on others, he measures how far he is
          from the surrender and denial of that will, the only possible
          deliverance from the world and its miseries. He sees how far he
          belongs to it, and how firmly he is bound to it; the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">known</span></em>
          suffering of others has no power to move him; he is given up to
          life and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">felt</span></em> suffering. It remains hidden
          whether this will ever break and overcome the vehemence of his
          will.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This exposition
          of the significance and inner nature of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">bad</span></em>,
          which as mere feeling, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, not as distinct, abstract
          knowledge, is the content of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">remorse</span></em>, will gain distinctness
          and completeness by the similar consideration of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">good</span></em> as
          a quality of human will, and finally of absolute resignation and
          holiness, which proceeds from it when it has attained its highest
          grade. For opposites always throw light upon each other, and the
          day at once reveals both itself and the night, as Spinoza admirably
          remarks.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 66. A theory
          of morals without proof, that is, mere moralising, can effect
          nothing, because it does not act as a motive. A theory of morals
          which does act as a motive can do so only by working on self-love.
          But what springs from this source has no moral worth. It follows
          from this that no genuine virtue can be produced <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page475">[pg 475]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg475"></a> through moral theory or abstract
          knowledge in general, but that such virtue must spring from that
          intuitive knowledge which recognises in the individuality of others
          the same nature as in our own.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For virtue
          certainly proceeds from knowledge, but not from the abstract
          knowledge that can be communicated through words. If it were so,
          virtue could be taught, and by here expressing in abstract language
          its nature and the knowledge which lies at its foundation, we
          should make every one who comprehends this even ethically better.
          But this is by no means the case. On the contrary, ethical
          discourses and preaching will just as little produce a virtuous man
          as all the systems of æsthetics from Aristotle downwards have
          succeeded in producing a poet. For the real inner nature of virtue
          the concept is unfruitful, just as it is in art, and it is only in
          a completely subordinate position that it can be of use as a tool
          in the elaboration and preserving of what has been ascertained and
          inferred by other means. <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Velle non
          discitur.</span></span> Abstract dogmas are, in fact, without
          influence upon virtue, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, upon the goodness of the
          disposition. False dogmas do not disturb it; true ones will
          scarcely assist it. It would, in fact, be a bad look-out if the
          cardinal fact in the life of man, his ethical worth, that worth
          which counts for eternity, were dependent upon anything the
          attainment of which is so much a matter of chance as is the case
          with dogmas, religious doctrines, and philosophical theories. For
          morality dogmas have this value only: The man who has become
          virtuous from knowledge of another kind, which is presently to be
          considered, possesses in them a scheme or formula according to
          which he accounts to his own reason, for the most part
          fictitiously, for his non-egoistical action, the nature of which
          it, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, he himself, does not
          comprehend, and with which account he has accustomed it to be
          content.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Upon conduct,
          outward action, dogmas may certainly exercise a powerful influence,
          as also custom and example <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page476">[pg 476]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg476"></a> (the last because the ordinary man does not
          trust his judgment, of the weakness of which he is conscious, but
          only follows his own or some one else's experience), but the
          disposition is not altered in this way.<a href="#note_80" id="noteref_80" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">80</span></span></a> All
          abstract knowledge gives only motives; but, as was shown above,
          motives can only alter the direction of the will, not the will
          itself. All communicable knowledge, however, can only affect the
          will as a motive. Thus when dogmas lead it, what the man really and
          in general wills remains still the same. He has only received
          different thoughts as to the ways in which it is to be attained,
          and imaginary motives guide him just like real ones. Therefore, for
          example, it is all one, as regards his ethical worth, whether he
          gives large gifts to the poor, firmly persuaded that he will
          receive everything tenfold in a future life, or expends the same
          sum on the improvement of an estate which will yield interest,
          certainly late, but all the more surely and largely. And he who for
          the sake of orthodoxy commits the heretic to the flames is as much
          a murderer as the bandit who does it for gain; and indeed, as
          regards inward circumstances, so also was he who slaughtered the
          Turks in the Holy Land, if, like the burner of heretics, he really
          did so because he thought that he would thereby gain a place in
          heaven. For these are careful only for themselves, for their own
          egoism, just like the bandit, from whom they are only distinguished
          by the absurdity of their means. From without, as has been said,
          the will can only be reached through motives, and these only alter
          the way in which it expresses itself, never the will itself.
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Velle non discitur.</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the case of
          good deeds, however, the doer of which appeals to dogmas, we must
          always distinguish whether these dogmas really are the motives
          which lead to the good deeds, or whether, as was said above, they
          are <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page477">[pg 477]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg477"></a> merely the illusive
          account of them with which he seeks to satisfy his own reason with
          regard to a good deed which really flows from quite a different
          source, a deed which he does because he is good, though he does not
          understand how to explain it rightly, and yet wishes to think
          something with regard to it. But this distinction is very hard to
          make, because it lies in the heart of a man. Therefore we can
          scarcely ever pass a correct moral judgment on the action of
          others, and very seldom on our own. The deeds and conduct of an
          individual and of a nation may be very much modified through
          dogmas, example, and custom. But in themselves all deeds
          (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">opera operata</span></span>) are merely empty
          forms, and only the disposition which leads to them gives them
          moral significance. This disposition, however, may be quite the
          same when its outward manifestation is very different. With an
          equal degree of wickedness, one man may die on the wheel, and
          another in the bosom of his family. It may be the same grade of
          wickedness which expresses itself in one nation in the coarse
          characteristics of murder and cannibalism, and in another finely
          and softly in miniature, in court intrigues, oppressions, and
          delicate plots of every kind; the inner nature remains the same. It
          is conceivable that a perfect state, or perhaps indeed a complete
          and firmly believed doctrine of rewards and punishments after
          death, might prevent every crime; politically much would be gained
          thereby; morally, nothing; only the expression of the will in life
          would be restricted.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus genuine
          goodness of disposition, disinterested virtue, and pure nobility do
          not proceed from abstract knowledge. Yet they do proceed from
          knowledge; but it is a direct intuitive knowledge, which can
          neither be reasoned away, nor arrived at by reasoning, a knowledge
          which, just because it is not abstract, cannot be communicated, but
          must arise in each for himself, which therefore finds its real and
          adequate expression not in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page478">[pg 478]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg478"></a> words, but only in deeds, in conduct, in the
          course of the life of man. We who here seek the theory of virtue,
          and have therefore also to express abstractly the nature of the
          knowledge which lies at its foundation, will yet be unable to
          convey that knowledge itself in this expression. We can only give
          the concept of this knowledge, and thus always start from action in
          which alone it becomes visible, and refer to action as its only
          adequate expression. We can only explain and interpret action,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, express abstractly what
          really takes place in it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before we speak
          of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">good</span></em> proper, in opposition to the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">bad</span></em>, which has been explained, we
          must touch on an intermediate grade, the mere negation of the bad:
          this is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">justice</span></em>. The nature of right and
          wrong has been fully explained above; therefore we may briefly say
          here, that he who voluntarily recognises and observes those merely
          moral limits between wrong and right, even where this is not
          secured by the state or any other external power, thus he who,
          according to our explanation, never carries the assertion of his
          own will so far as to deny the will appearing in another
          individual, is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">just</span></em>. Thus, in order to increase
          his own well-being, he will not inflict suffering upon others,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, he will commit no crime,
          he will respect the rights and the property of others. We see that
          for such a just man the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium
          individuationis</span></span> is no longer, as in the case of the
          bad man, an absolute wall of partition. We see that he does not,
          like the bad man, merely assert his own manifestation of will and
          deny all others; that other persons are not for him mere masks,
          whose nature is quite different from his own; but he shows in his
          conduct that he also recognises his own nature—the will to live as
          a thing-in-itself, in the foreign manifestation which is only given
          to him as idea. Thus he finds himself again in that other
          manifestation, up to a certain point, that of doing no wrong,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, abstaining from injury. To
          this extent, therefore, he sees through the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium individuationis</span></span>, the
          veil of Mâyâ; so far he <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page479">[pg
          479]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg479"></a>
          sets the being external to him on a level with his own—he does it
          no injury.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If we examine
          the inmost nature of this justice, there already lies in it the
          resolution not to go so far in the assertion of one's own will as
          to deny the manifestations of will of others, by compelling them to
          serve one's own. One will therefore wish to render to others as
          much as one receives from them. The highest degree of this justice
          of disposition, which is, however, always united with goodness
          proper, whose character is no longer merely negative, extends so
          far that a man doubts his right to inherited property, wishes to
          support his body only by his own powers, mental and physical, feels
          every service of others and every luxury a reproach, and finally
          embraces voluntary poverty. Thus we see how Pascal, when he became
          an ascetic, would no longer permit any services to be rendered him,
          although he had servants enough; in spite of his constant bad
          health he made his bed himself, brought his own food from the
          kitchen, &amp;c. (<span class="tei tei-q">“Vie de Pascal, par sa
          Sœur,”</span> p. 19). Quite in keeping with this, it is reported
          that many Hindus, even Rajas with great wealth, expend it merely on
          the maintenance of their position, their court and attendants, and
          themselves observe with the greatest scrupulousness the maxim that
          a man should eat nothing that he has not himself both sowed and
          reaped. Yet a certain misunderstanding lies at the bottom of this;
          for one man, just because he is rich and powerful, can render such
          signal services to the whole of human society that they
          counterbalance the wealth he has inherited, for the secure
          possession of which he is indebted to society. In reality that
          excessive justice of such Hindus is already more than justice; it
          is actual renunciation, denial of the will to live,—asceticism, of
          which we shall speak last. On the other hand, pure idleness and
          living through the exertions of others, in the case of inherited
          wealth, without accomplishing anything, may be regarded as morally
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page480">[pg 480]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg480"></a> wrong, even if it
          must remain right according to positive laws.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have found
          that voluntary justice has its inmost source in a certain degree of
          penetration of the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium
          individuationis</span></span>, while the unjust remain entirely
          involved in this principle. This penetration may exist not only in
          the degree which is required for justice, but also in the higher
          degree which leads to benevolence and well-doing, to love of
          mankind. And this may take place however strong and energetic in
          itself the will which appears in such an individual may be.
          Knowledge can always counterbalance it in him, teach him to resist
          the tendency to wrong, and even produce in him every degree of
          goodness, and indeed of resignation. Thus the good man is by no
          means to be regarded as originally a weaker manifestation of will
          than the bad man, but it is knowledge which in him masters the
          blind striving of will. There are certainly individuals who merely
          seem to have a good disposition on account of the weakness of the
          will appearing in them, but what they are soon appears from the
          fact that they are not capable of any remarkable self-conquest in
          order to perform a just or good deed.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If, however, as
          a rare exception, we meet a man who possesses a considerable
          income, but uses very little of it for himself and gives all the
          rest to the poor, while he denies himself many pleasures and
          comforts, and we seek to explain the action of this man, we shall
          find, apart altogether from the dogmas through which he tries to
          make his action intelligible to his reason, that the simplest
          general expression and the essential character of his conduct is
          that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">he
          makes less distinction than is usually made between himself and
          others</span></em>. This distinction is so great in the eyes of
          many that the suffering of others is a direct pleasure to the
          wicked and a welcome means of happiness to the unjust. The merely
          just man is content not to cause it; and, in general, most men
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page481">[pg 481]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg481"></a> know and are
          acquainted with innumerable sufferings of others in their vicinity,
          but do not determine to mitigate them, because to do so would
          involve some self-denial on their part. Thus, in each of all these
          a strong distinction seems to prevail between his own ego and that
          of others; on the other hand, to the noble man we have imagined,
          this distinction is not so significant. The <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium individuationis</span></span>, the
          form of the phenomenon, no longer holds him so tightly in its
          grasp, but the suffering which he sees in others touches him almost
          as closely as his own. He therefore tries to strike a balance
          between them, denies himself pleasures, practises renunciation, in
          order to mitigate the sufferings of others. He sees that the
          distinction between himself and others, which to the bad man is so
          great a gulf, only belongs to a fleeting and illusive phenomenon.
          He recognises directly and without reasoning that the in-itself of
          his own manifestation is also that of others, the will to live,
          which constitutes the inner nature of everything and lives in all;
          indeed, that this applies also to the brutes and the whole of
          nature, and therefore he will not cause suffering even to a
          brute.<a href="#note_81" id="noteref_81" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">81</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He is now just
          as little likely to allow others to starve, while he himself has
          enough and to spare, as any one would be to suffer hunger one day
          in order to have more the next day than he could enjoy. For to him
          who does works of love the veil of Mâyâ has become transparent,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page482">[pg 482]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg482"></a> the illusion of the
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium individuationis</span></span> has
          left him. He recognises himself, his will, in every being, and
          consequently also in the sufferer. He is now free from the
          perversity with which the will to live, not recognising itself,
          here in one individual enjoys a fleeting and precarious pleasure,
          and there in another pays for it with suffering and starvation, and
          thus both inflicts and endures misery, not knowing that, like
          Thyestes, it eagerly devours its own flesh; and then, on the one
          hand, laments its undeserved suffering, and on the other hand
          transgresses without fear of Nemesis, always merely because,
          involved in the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium
          individuationis</span></span>, thus generally in the kind of
          knowledge which is governed by the principle of sufficient reason,
          it does not recognise itself in the foreign phenomenon, and
          therefore does not perceive eternal justice. To be cured of this
          illusion and deception of Mâyâ, and to do works of love, are one
          and the same. But the latter is the necessary and inevitable
          symptom of that knowledge.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The opposite of
          the sting of conscience, the origin and significance of which is
          explained above, is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">good conscience</span></em>, the satisfaction
          which we experience after every disinterested deed. It arises from
          the fact that such a deed, as it proceeds from the direct
          recognition of our own inner being in the phenomenon of another,
          affords us also the verification of this knowledge, the knowledge
          that our true self exists not only in our own person, this
          particular manifestation, but in everything that lives. By this the
          heart feels itself enlarged, as by egoism it is contracted. For as
          the latter concentrates our interest upon the particular
          manifestation of our own individuality, upon which knowledge always
          presents to us the innumerable dangers which constantly threaten
          this manifestation, and anxiety and care becomes the key-note of
          our disposition; the knowledge that everything living is just as
          much our own inner nature, as is our own person, extends our
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page483">[pg 483]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg483"></a> interest to
          everything living; and in this way the heart is enlarged. Thus
          through the diminished interest in our own self, the anxious care
          for the self is attacked at its very root and limited; hence the
          peace, the unbroken serenity, which a virtuous disposition and a
          good conscience affords, and the more distinct appearance of this
          with every good deed, for it proves to ourselves the depth of that
          disposition. The egoist feels himself surrounded by strange and
          hostile individuals, and all his hope is centred in his own good.
          The good man lives in a world of friendly individuals, the
          well-being of any of whom he regards as his own. Therefore,
          although the knowledge of the lot of mankind generally does not
          make his disposition a joyful one, yet the permanent knowledge of
          his own nature in all living beings, gives him a certain evenness,
          and even serenity of disposition. For the interest which is
          extended to innumerable manifestations cannot cause such anxiety as
          that which is concentrated upon one. The accidents which concern
          individuals collectively, equalise themselves, while those which
          happen to the particular individual constitute good or bad
          fortune.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus, though
          others have set up moral principles which they give out as
          prescriptions for virtue, and laws which it was necessary to
          follow, I, as has already been said, cannot do this because I have
          no <span class="tei tei-q">“ought”</span> or law to prescribe to
          the eternally free-will. Yet on the other hand, in the connection
          of my system, what to a certain extent corresponds and is analogous
          to that undertaking is the purely theoretical truth, of which my
          whole exposition may be regarded as merely an elaboration, that the

          free from the forms of the phenomenal, and consequently from
          multiplicity; a truth, which, with reference to action, I do not

          484]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg484"></a>
          he comes in contact, with clear knowledge and firm inward
          conviction, is certain of all virtue and blessedness, and is on the
          direct road to salvation.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But before I go
          further, and, as the conclusion of my exposition, show how love,
          the origin and nature of which we recognised as the penetration of
          the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium
          individuationis</span></span>, leads to salvation, to the entire
          surrender of the will to live, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          of all volition, and also how another path, less soft but more
          frequented, leads men to the same goal, a paradoxical proposition
          must first be stated and explained; not because it is paradoxical,
          but because it is true, and is necessary to the completeness of the
          thought I have present. It is this: <span class="tei tei-q">“All
          love (αγαπη, <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">caritas</span></span>) is
          sympathy.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 67. We have
          seen how justice proceeds from the penetration of the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium individuationis</span></span> in a
          less degree, and how from its penetration in a higher degree there
          arises goodness of disposition proper, which shows itself as pure,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, disinterested love towards
          others. When now the latter becomes perfect, it places other
          individuals and their fate completely on a level with itself and
          its own fate. Further than this it cannot go, for there exists no
          reason for preferring the individuality of another to its own. Yet
          the number of other individuals whose whole happiness or life is in
          danger may outweigh the regard for one's own particular well-being.
          In such a case, the character that has attained to the highest
          goodness and perfect nobility will entirely sacrifice its own
          well-being, and even its life, for the well-being of many others.
          So died Codrus, and Leonidas, and Regulus, and Decius Mus, and
          Arnold von Winkelried; so dies every one who voluntarily and
          consciously faces certain death for his friends or his country. And
          they also stand on the same level who voluntarily submit to
          suffering and death for maintaining what conduces and rightly
          belongs to the welfare of all mankind; that is, for maintaining
          universal and important truths and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page485">[pg 485]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg485"></a> destroying great errors. So died Socrates and
          Giordano Bruno, and so many a hero of the truth suffered death at
          the stake at the hands of the priests.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now, however, I
          must remind the reader, with reference to the paradox stated above,
          that we found before that suffering is essential to life as a
          whole, and inseparable from it. And that we saw that every wish
          proceeds from a need, from a want, from suffering, and that
          therefore every satisfaction is only the removal of a pain, and
          brings no positive happiness; that the joys certainly lie to the
          wish, presenting themselves as a positive good, but in truth they
          have only a negative nature, and are only the end of an evil.
          Therefore what goodness, love, and nobleness do for others, is
          always merely an alleviation of their suffering, and consequently
          all that can influence them to good deeds and works of love, is
          simply the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">knowledge of the suffering of
          others</span></em>, which is directly understood from their own
          suffering and placed on a level with it. But it follows from this
          that pure love (αγαπη, <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">caritas</span></span>) is in its nature
          sympathy; whether the suffering it mitigates, to which every
          unsatisfied wish belongs, be great or small. Therefore we shall
          have no hesitation, in direct contradiction to Kant, who will only
          recognise all true goodness and all virtue to be such, if it has
          proceeded from abstract reflection, and indeed from the conception
          of duty and of the categorical imperative, and explains felt
          sympathy as weakness, and by no means virtue, we shall have no
          hesitation, I say, in direct contradiction to Kant, in saying: the
          mere concept is for genuine virtue just as unfruitful as it is for
          genuine art: all true and pure love is sympathy, and all love which
          is not sympathy is selfishness. Ερος is selfishness, αγαπη is
          sympathy. Combinations of the two frequently occur. Indeed genuine
          friendship is always a mixture of selfishness and sympathy; the
          former lies in the pleasure experienced in the presence of the
          friend, whose individuality corresponds to our <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page486">[pg 486]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg486"></a> own, and this almost always constitutes
          the greatest part; sympathy shows itself in the sincere
          participation in his joy and grief, and the disinterested
          sacrifices made in respect of the latter. Thus Spinoza says:
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Benevolentia nihil aliud est, quam cupiditas
          ex commiseratione orta</span></span> (Eth. iii. pr. 27, cor. 3,
          schol.) As a confirmation of our paradoxical proposition it may be
          observed that the tone and words of the language and caresses of
          pure love, entirely coincide with the tones of sympathy; and we may
          also remark in passing that in Italian sympathy and true love are
          denoted by the same word <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="it"><span style="font-style: italic">pietà</span></span>.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is also the
          place to explain one of the most striking peculiarities of human
          nature, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">weeping</span></em>, which, like laughter,
          belongs to those qualities which distinguish man from the brutes.
          Weeping is by no means a direct expression of pain, for it occurs
          where there is very little pain. In my opinion, indeed, we never
          weep directly on account of the pain we experience, but always
          merely on account of its repetition in reflection. We pass from the
          felt pain, even when it is physical, to a mere idea of it, and then
          find our own state so deserving of sympathy that we are firmly and
          sincerely convinced that if another were the sufferer, we would be
          full of sympathy, and love to relieve him. But now we ourselves are
          the object of our own sympathy; with the most benevolent
          disposition we are ourselves most in need of help; we feel that we
          suffer more than we could see another suffer; and in this very
          complex frame of mind, in which the directly felt suffering only
          comes to perception by a doubly circuitous route, imagined as the
          suffering of another, sympathised with as such, and then suddenly
          perceived again as directly our own,—in this complex frame of mind,
          I say, Nature relieves itself through that remarkable physical
          conflict. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Weeping</span></em> is accordingly <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sympathy with our
          own selves</span></em>, or sympathy directed back on its source. It
          is therefore conditional upon the capacity for love and sympathy,
          and also upon imagination. Therefore <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page487">[pg 487]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg487"></a> men who are either hard-hearted or
          unimaginative do not weep easily, and weeping is even always
          regarded as a sign of a certain degree of goodness of character,
          and disarms anger, because it is felt that whoever can still weep,
          must necessarily always be capable of love, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          sympathy towards others, for this enters in the manner described
          into the disposition that leads to weeping. The description which
          Petrarch gives of the rising of his own tears, naïvely and truly
          expressing his feeling, entirely agrees with the explanation we
          have given—</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What has been
          said is also confirmed by the fact that children who have been hurt
          generally do not cry till some one commiserates them; thus not on
          account of the pain, but on account of the idea of it. When we are
          moved to tears, not through our own suffering but through that of
          another, this happens as follows. Either we vividly put ourselves
          in the place of the sufferer by imagination, or see in his fate the
          lot of humanity as a whole, and consequently, first of all, our own
          lot; and thus, in a very roundabout way, it is yet always about
          ourselves that we weep, sympathy with ourselves which we feel. This
          seems to be the principal reason of the universal, and thus
          natural, weeping in the case of death. The mourner does not weep
          for his loss; he would be ashamed of such egotistical tears,
          instead of which he is sometimes ashamed of not weeping. First of
          all he certainly weeps for the fate of the dead, but he also weeps
          when, after long, heavy, and incurable suffering, death was to this
          man a wished-for deliverance. Thus, principally, he is seized with
          sympathy for the lot of all <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page488">[pg 488]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg488"></a> mankind, which is necessarily finite, so that
          every life, however aspiring, and often rich in deeds, must be
          extinguished and become nothing. But in this lot of mankind the
          mourner sees first of all his own, and this all the more, the more
          closely he is related to him who has died, thus most of all if it
          is his father. Although to his father his life was misery through
          age and sickness, and though his helplessness was a heavy burden to
          his son, yet that son weeps bitterly over the death of his father
          for the reason which has been given.<a href="#note_83" id="noteref_83" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">83</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 68. After this
          digression about the identity of pure love and sympathy, the final
          return of which upon our own individuality has, as its symptom, the
          phenomenon of weeping, I now take up the thread of our discussion
          of the ethical significance of action, in order to show how, from
          the same source from which all goodness, love, virtue, and nobility
          of character spring, there finally arises that which I call the
          denial of the will to live.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We saw before
          that hatred and wickedness are conditioned by egoism, and egoism
          rests on the entanglement of knowledge in the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium individuationis</span></span>. Thus
          we found that the penetration of that <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium individuationis</span></span> is
          the source and the nature of justice, and when it is carried
          further, even to its fullest extent, it is the source and nature of
          love and nobility of character. For this penetration alone, by
          abolishing the distinction between our own individuality and that
          of others, renders possible and explains perfect goodness of
          disposition, extending to disinterested love and the most generous
          self-sacrifice for others.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If, however,
          this penetration of the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium
          individuationis</span></span>, this direct knowledge of the
          identity of will in all its manifestations, is present in a high
          degree of distinctness, it will at once show an influence upon the
          will <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page489">[pg 489]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg489"></a> which extends still
          further. If that veil of Mâyâ, the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium individuationis</span></span>, is
          lifted from the eyes of a man to such an extent that he no longer
          makes the egotistical distinction between his person and that of
          others, but takes as much interest in the sufferings of other
          individuals as in his own, and therefore is not only benevolent in
          the highest degree, but even ready to sacrifice his own
          individuality whenever such a sacrifice will save a number of other
          persons, then it clearly follows that such a man, who recognises in
          all beings his own inmost and true self, must also regard the
          infinite suffering of all suffering beings as his own, and take on
          himself the pain of the whole world. No suffering is any longer
          strange to him. All the miseries of others which he sees and is so
          seldom able to alleviate, all the miseries he knows directly, and
          even those which he only knows as possible, work upon his mind like
          his own. It is no longer the changing joy and sorrow of his own
          person that he has in view, as is the case with him who is still
          involved in egoism; but, since he sees through the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium individuationis</span></span>, all
          lies equally near him. He knows the whole, comprehends its nature,
          and finds that it consists in a constant passing away, vain
          striving, inward conflict, and continual suffering. He sees
          wherever he looks suffering humanity, the suffering brute creation,
          and a world that passes away. But all this now lies as near him as
          his own person lies to the egoist. Why should he now, with such
          knowledge of the world, assert this very life through constant acts
          of will, and thereby bind himself ever more closely to it, press it
          ever more firmly to himself? Thus he who is still involved in the
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium individuationis</span></span>, in
          egoism, only knows particular things and their relation to his own
          person, and these constantly become new <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">motives</span></em>
          of his volition. But, on the other hand, that knowledge of the
          whole, of the nature of the thing-in-itself which has been
          described, becomes a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">quieter</span></em> of all and every volition.
          The will now turns away <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page490">[pg
          490]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg490"></a>
          from life; it now shudders at the pleasures in which it recognises
          the assertion of life. Man now attains to the state of voluntary
          renunciation, resignation, true indifference, and perfect
          will-lessness. If at times, in the hard experience of our own
          suffering, or in the vivid recognition of that of others, the
          knowledge of the vanity and bitterness of life draws nigh to us
          also who are still wrapt in the veil of Mâyâ, and we would like to
          destroy the sting of the desires, close the entrance against all
          suffering, and purify and sanctify ourselves by complete and final
          renunciation; yet the illusion of the phenomenon soon entangles us
          again, and its motives influence the will anew; we cannot tear
          ourselves free. The allurement of hope, the flattery of the
          present, the sweetness of pleasure, the well-being which falls to
          our lot, amid the lamentations of a suffering world governed by
          chance and error, draws us back to it and rivets our bonds anew.
          Therefore Jesus says: <span class="tei tei-q">“It is easier for a
          camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to
          enter into the kingdom of God.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If we compare
          life to a course or path through which we must unceasingly run—a
          path of red-hot coals, with a few cool places here and there; then
          he who is entangled in delusion is consoled by the cool places, on
          which he now stands, or which he sees near him, and sets out to run
          through the course. But he who sees through the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium individuationis</span></span>, and
          recognises the real nature of the thing-in-itself, and thus the
          whole, is no longer susceptible of such consolation; he sees
          himself in all places at once, and withdraws. His will turns round,
          no longer asserts its own nature, which is reflected in the
          phenomenon, but denies it. The phenomenon by which this change is
          marked, is the transition from virtue to asceticism. That is to
          say, it no longer suffices for such a man to love others as
          himself, and to do as much for them as for himself; but there
          arises within him a horror of the nature of which his own
          phenomenal existence <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page491">[pg
          491]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg491"></a>
          is an expression, the will to live, the kernel and inner nature of
          that world which is recognised as full of misery. He therefore
          disowns this nature which appears in him, and is already expressed
          through his body, and his action gives the lie to his phenomenal
          existence, and appears in open contradiction to it. Essentially
          nothing else but a manifestation of will, he ceases to will
          anything, guards against attaching his will to anything, and seeks
          to confirm in himself the greatest indifference to everything. His
          body, healthy and strong, expresses through the genitals, the
          sexual impulse; but he denies the will and gives the lie to the
          body; he desires no sensual gratification under any condition.
          Voluntary and complete chastity is the first step in asceticism or
          the denial of the will to live. It thereby denies the assertion of
          the will which extends beyond the individual life, and gives the
          assurance that with the life of this body, the will, whose
          manifestation it is, ceases. Nature, always true and naïve,
          declares that if this maxim became universal, the human race would
          die out; and I think I may assume, in accordance with what was said
          in the Second Book about the connection of all manifestations of
          will, that with its highest manifestation, the weaker reflection of
          it would also pass away, as the twilight vanishes along with the
          full light. With the entire abolition of knowledge, the rest of the
          world would of itself vanish into nothing; for without a subject
          there is no object. I should like here to refer to a passage in the
          Vedas, where it is said: <span class="tei tei-q">“As in this world
          hungry infants press round their mother; so do all beings await the
          holy oblation.”</span> (Asiatic Researches, vol. viii.; Colebrooke,
          On the Vedas, Abstract of the Sama-Veda; also in Colebrooke's
          Miscellaneous Essays, vol. i. p. 79.) Sacrifice means resignation
          generally, and the rest of nature must look for its salvation to
          man who is at once the priest and the sacrifice. Indeed it deserves
          to be noticed as very remarkable, that this thought has also
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page492">[pg 492]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg492"></a> been expressed by
          the admirable and unfathomably profound Angelus Silesius, in the
          little poem entitled, <span class="tei tei-q">“Man brings all to
          God;”</span> it runs, <span class="tei tei-q">“Man! all loves thee;
          around thee great is the throng. All things flee to thee that they
          may attain to God.”</span> But a yet greater mystic, Meister
          Eckhard, whose wonderful writings are at last accessible (1857)
          through the edition of Franz Pfeiffer, says the same thing (p. 459)
          quite in the sense explained here: <span class="tei tei-q">“I bear
          witness to the saying of Christ. I, if I be lifted up from the
          earth, will draw all things unto me (John xii. 32). So shall the
          good man draw all things up to God, to the source whence they first
          came. The Masters certify to us that all creatures are made for the
          sake of man. This is proved in all created things, by the fact that
          the one makes the use of the other; the ox makes use of the grass,
          the fish of the water, the bird of the air, the wild beast of the
          forest. Thus, all created things become of use to the good man. A
          good man brings to God the one created thing in the other.”</span>
          He means to say, that man makes use of the brutes in this life
          because, in and with himself, he saves them also. It also seems to
          me that that difficult passage in the Bible, Rom. viii. 21-24, must
          be interpreted in this sense.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Buddhism
          also, there is no lack of expressions of this truth. For example,
          when Buddha, still as Bodisatwa, has his horse saddled for the last
          time, for his flight into the wilderness from his father's house,
          he says these lines to the horse: <span class="tei tei-q">“Long
          hast thou existed in life and in death, but now thou shalt cease
          from carrying and drawing. Bear me but this once more, O Kantakana,
          away from here, and when I have attained to the Law (have become
          Buddha) I will not forget thee”</span> (Foe Koue Ki, trad. p. Abel
          Rémusat, p. 233).</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Asceticism then
          shows itself further in voluntary and intentional poverty, which
          not only arises <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">per accidens</span></span>,
          because the possessions are given away to mitigate the sufferings
          of others, but is here an end in itself, is meant <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page493">[pg 493]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg493"></a> to serve as a constant mortification of
          will, so that the satisfaction of the wishes, the sweet of life,
          shall not again arouse the will, against which self-knowledge has
          conceived a horror. He who has attained to this point, still always
          feels, as a living body, as concrete manifestation of will, the
          natural disposition for every kind of volition; but he
          intentionally suppresses it, for he compels himself to refrain from
          doing all that he would like to do, and to do all that he would
          like not to do, even if this has no further end than that of
          serving as a mortification of will. Since he himself denies the
          will which appears in his own person, he will not resist if another
          does the same, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, inflicts wrongs upon him.
          Therefore every suffering coming to him from without, through
          chance or the wickedness of others, is welcome to him, every
          injury, ignominy, and insult; he receives them gladly as the
          opportunity of learning with certainty that he no longer asserts
          the will, but gladly sides with every enemy of the manifestation of
          will which is his own person. Therefore he bears such ignominy and
          suffering with inexhaustible patience and meekness, returns good
          for evil without ostentation, and allows the fire of anger to rise
          within him just as little as that of the desires. And he mortifies
          not only the will itself, but also its visible form, its
          objectivity, the body. He nourishes it sparingly, lest its
          excessive vigour and prosperity should animate and excite more
          strongly the will, of which it is merely the expression and the
          mirror. So he practises fasting, and even resorts to chastisement
          and self-inflicted torture, in order that, by constant privation
          and suffering, he may more and more break down and destroy the
          will, which he recognises and abhors as the source of his own
          suffering existence and that of the world. If at last death comes,
          which puts an end to this manifestation of that will, whose
          existence here has long since perished through free-denial of
          itself, with the exception of the weak residue of it <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page494">[pg 494]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg494"></a> which appears as the life of this body;
          it is most welcome, and is gladly received as a longed-for
          deliverance. Here it is not, as in the case of others, merely the
          manifestation which ends with death; but the inner nature itself is
          abolished, which here existed only in the manifestation, and that
          in a very weak degree;<a href="#note_84" id="noteref_84" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">84</span></span></a> this
          last slight bond is now broken. For him who thus ends, the world
          has ended also.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And what I have
          here described with feeble tongue and only in general terms, is no
          philosophical fable, invented by myself, and only of to-day; no, it
          was the enviable life of so many saints and beautiful souls among
          Christians, and still more among Hindus and Buddhists, and also
          among the believers of other religions. However different were the
          dogmas impressed on their reason, the same inward, direct,
          intuitive knowledge, from which alone all virtue and holiness
          proceed, expressed itself in precisely the same way in the conduct
          of life. For here also the great distinction between intuitive and
          abstract knowledge shows itself; a distinction which is of such
          importance and universal application in our whole investigation,
          and which has hitherto been too little attended to. There is a wide
          gulf between the two, which can only be crossed by the aid of
          philosophy, as regards the knowledge of the nature of the world.
          Intuitively or <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">in concreto</span></span>,
          every man is really conscious of all philosophical truths, but to
          bring them to abstract knowledge, to reflection, is the work of
          philosophy, which neither ought nor is able to do more than
          this.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus it may be
          that the inner nature of holiness, self-renunciation, mortification
          of our own will, asceticism, is <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page495">[pg 495]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg495"></a> here for the first time expressed abstractly,
          and free from all mythical elements, as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">denial of the will
          to live</span></em>, appearing after the complete knowledge of its
          own nature has become a quieter of all volition. On the other hand,
          it has been known directly and realised in practice by saints and
          ascetics, who had all the same inward knowledge, though they used
          very different language with regard to it, according to the dogmas
          which their reason had accepted, and in consequence of which an
          Indian, a Christian, or a Lama saint must each give a very
          different account of his conduct, which is, however, of no
          importance as regards the fact. A saint may be full of the
          absurdest superstition, or, on the contrary, he may be a
          philosopher, it is all the same. His conduct alone certifies that
          he is a saint, for, in a moral regard, it proceeds from knowledge
          of the world and its nature, which is not abstractly but
          intuitively and directly apprehended, and is only expressed by him
          in any dogma for the satisfaction of his reason. It is therefore
          just as little needful that a saint should be a philosopher as that
          a philosopher should be a saint; just as it is not necessary that a
          perfectly beautiful man should be a great sculptor, or that a great
          sculptor should himself be a beautiful man. In general, it is a
          strange demand upon a moralist that he should teach no other virtue
          than that which he himself possesses. To repeat the whole nature of
          the world abstractly, universally, and distinctly in concepts, and
          thus to store up, as it were, a reflected image of it in permanent
          concepts always at the command of the reason; this and nothing else
          is philosophy. I refer the reader to the passage quoted from Bacon
          in the First Book.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the
          description I have given above of the denial of the will to live,
          of the conduct of a beautiful soul, of a resigned and voluntarily
          expiating saint, is merely abstract and general, and therefore
          cold. As the knowledge from which the denial of the will proceeds
          is intuitive and not abstract, it finds its most perfect
          expression, not in abstract <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page496">[pg 496]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg496"></a> conceptions, but in deeds and conduct.
          Therefore, in order to understand fully what we philosophically
          express as denial of the will to live, one must come to know
          examples of it in experience and actual life. Certainly they are
          not to be met with in daily experience: <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Nam omnia præclara tam difficilia quam rara
          sunt</span></span>, Spinoza admirably says. Therefore, unless by a
          specially happy fate we are made eye-witnesses, we have to content
          ourselves with descriptions of the lives of such men. Indian
          literature, as we see from the little that we as yet know through
          translations, is very rich in descriptions of the lives of saints,
          penitents, Samanas or ascetics, Sannyâsis or mendicants, and
          whatever else they may be called. Even the well-known <span class="tei tei-q">“Mythologie des Indous, par Mad. de Polier,”</span>
          though by no means to be commended in every respect, contains many
          excellent examples of this kind (especially in ch. 13, vol. ii.)
          Among Christians also there is no lack of examples which afford us
          the illustrations we desire. See the biographies, for the most part
          badly written, of those persons who are sometimes called saintly
          souls, sometimes pietists, quietists, devout enthusiasts, and so
          forth. Collections of such biographies have been made at various
          times, such as Tersteegen's <span class="tei tei-q">“Leben heiliger
          Seelen,”</span> Reiz's <span class="tei tei-q">“Geschichte der
          Wiedergeborennen,”</span> in our own day, a collection by Kanne,
          which, with much that is bad, yet contains some good, and
          especially the <span class="tei tei-q">“Leben der Beata
          Sturmin.”</span> To this category very properly belongs the life of
          St. Francis of Assisi, that true personification of the ascetic,
          and prototype of all mendicant friars. His life, described by his
          younger contemporary, St. Bonaventura, also famous as a scholastic,
          has recently been republished. <span class="tei tei-q">“Vita S.
          Francisci a S. Bonaventura concinnata”</span> (Soest, 1847), though
          shortly before a painstaking and detailed biography, making use of
          all sources of information, appeared in France, <span class="tei tei-q">“Histoire de S. François d'Assise, par Chavin de
          Mallan”</span> (1845). As an Oriental parallel of these
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page497">[pg 497]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg497"></a> monastic writings we
          have the very valuable work of Spence Hardy, <span class="tei tei-q">“Eastern Monachism; an Account of the Order of
          Mendicants founded by Gotama Budha”</span> (1850). It shows us the
          same thing in another dress. We also see what a matter of
          indifference it is whether it proceeds from a theistical or an
          atheistical religion. But as a special and exceedingly full example
          and practical illustration of the conceptions I have established, I
          can thoroughly recommend the <span class="tei tei-q">“Autobiography
          of Madame de Guion.”</span> To become acquainted with this great
          and beautiful soul, the very thought of whom always fills me with
          reverence, and to do justice to the excellence of her disposition
          while making allowance for the superstition of her reason, must be
          just as delightful to every man of the better sort as with vulgar
          thinkers, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the majority, that book
          will always stand in bad repute. For it is the case with regard to
          everything, that each man can only prize that which to a certain
          extent is analogous to him and for which he has at least a slight
          inclination. This holds good of ethical concerns as well as of
          intellectual. We might to a certain extent regard the well-known
          French biography of Spinoza as a case in point, if we used as a key
          to it that noble introduction to his very insufficient essay,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“De Emendatione Intellectus,”</span> a
          passage which I can also recommend as the most effectual means I
          know of stilling the storm of the passions. Finally, even the great
          Goethe, Greek as he is, did not think it below his dignity to show
          us this most beautiful side of humanity in the magic mirror of
          poetic art, for he represented the life of Fräulein Klettenberg in
          an idealised form in his <span class="tei tei-q">“Confessions of a
          Beautiful Soul,”</span> and later, in his own biography, gave us
          also an historical account of it. Besides this, he twice told the
          story of the life of St. Philippo Neri. The history of the world,
          will, and indeed must, keep silence about the men whose conduct is
          the best and only adequate illustration of this important point of
          our investigation, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page498">[pg
          498]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg498"></a>
          for the material of the history of the world is quite different,
          and indeed opposed to this. It is not the denial of the will to
          live, but its assertion and its manifestation in innumerable
          individuals in which its conflict with itself at the highest grade
          of its objectification appears with perfect distinctness, and
          brings before our eyes, now the ascendancy of the individual
          through prudence, now the might of the many through their mass, now
          the might of chance personified as fate, always the vanity and
          emptiness of the whole effort. We, however, do not follow here the
          course of phenomena in time, but, as philosophers, we seek to
          investigate the ethical significance of action, and take this as
          the only criterion of what for us is significant and important.
          Thus we will not be withheld by any fear of the constant numerical
          superiority of vulgarity and dulness from acknowledging that the
          greatest, most important, and most significant phenomenon that the
          world can show is not the conqueror of the world, but the subduer
          of it; is nothing but the quiet, unobserved life of a man who has
          attained to the knowledge in consequence of which he surrenders and
          denies that will to live which fills everything and strives and
          strains in all, and which first gains freedom here in him alone, so
          that his conduct becomes the exact opposite of that of other men.
          In this respect, therefore, for the philosopher, these accounts of
          the lives of holy, self-denying men, badly as they are generally
          written, and mixed as they are with superstition and nonsense, are,
          because of the significance of the material, immeasurably more
          instructive and important than even Plutarch and Livy.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It will further
          assist us much in obtaining a more definite and full knowledge of
          what we have expressed abstractly and generally, according to our
          method of exposition, as the denial of the will to live, if we
          consider the moral teaching that has been imparted with this
          intention, and by men who were full of this spirit; <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page499">[pg 499]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg499"></a> and this will also show how old our
          view is, though the pure philosophical expression of it may be
          quite new. The teaching of this kind which lies nearest to hand is
          Christianity, the ethics of which are entirely in the spirit
          indicated, and lead not only to the highest degrees of human love,
          but also to renunciation. The germ of this last side of it is
          certainly distinctly present in the writings of the Apostles, but
          it was only fully developed and expressed later. We find the
          Apostles enjoining the love of our neighbour as ourselves,
          benevolence, the requital of hatred with love and well-doing,
          patience, meekness, the endurance of all possible injuries without
          resistance, abstemiousness in nourishment to keep down lust,
          resistance to sensual desire, if possible, altogether. We already
          see here the first degrees of asceticism, or denial of the will
          proper. This last expression denotes that which in the Gospels is
          called denying ourselves and taking up the cross (Matt. xvi. 24,
          25; Mark viii. 34, 35; Luke ix. 23, 24, xiv. 26, 27, 33). This
          tendency soon developed itself more and more, and was the origin of
          hermits, anchorites, and monasticism—an origin which in itself was
          pure and holy, but for that very reason unsuitable for the great
          majority of men; therefore what developed out of it could only be
          hypocrisy and wickedness, for <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">abusus optimi pessimus</span></span>. In more
          developed Christianity, we see that seed of asceticism unfold into
          the full flower in the writings of the Christian saints and
          mystics. These preach, besides the purest love, complete
          resignation, voluntary and absolute poverty, genuine calmness,
          perfect indifference to all worldly things, dying to our own will
          and being born again in God, entire forgetting of our own person,
          and sinking ourselves in the contemplation of God. A full
          exposition of this will be found in Fénélon's <span class="tei tei-q">“Explication des Maximes des Saints sur la Vie
          Interieure.”</span> But the spirit of this development of
          Christianity is certainly nowhere so fully and powerfully
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page500">[pg 500]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg500"></a> expressed as in the
          writings of the German mystics, in the works of Meister Eckhard,
          and in that justly famous book <span class="tei tei-q">“Die
          Deutsche Theologie,”</span> of which Luther says in the
          introduction to it which he wrote, that with the exception of the
          Bible and St. Augustine, he had learnt more from it of what God,
          Christ, and man are than from any other book. Yet we only got the
          genuine and correct text of it in the year 1851, in the Stuttgart
          edition by Pfeiffer. The precepts and doctrines which are laid down
          there are the most perfect exposition, sprung from deep inward
          conviction of what I have presented as the denial of the will. It
          should therefore be studied more closely in that form before it is
          dogmatised about with Jewish-Protestant assurance. Tauler's
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Nachfolgung des armen Leben
          Christi,”</span> and also his <span class="tei tei-q">“Medulla
          Animæ,”</span> are written in the same admirable spirit, though not
          quite equal in value to that work. In my opinion the teaching of
          these genuine Christian mystics, when compared with the teaching of
          the New Testament, is as alcohol to wine, or what becomes visible
          in the New Testament as through a veil and mist appears to us in
          the works of the mystics without cloak or disguise, in full
          clearness and distinctness. Finally, the New Testament might be
          regarded as the first initiation, the mystics as the second,—σμικρα
          και μεγαλα μυστηρια.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We find,
          however, that which we have called the denial of the will to live
          more fully developed, more variously expressed, and more vividly
          represented in the ancient Sanscrit writings than could be the case
          in the Christian Church and the Western world. That this important
          ethical view of life could here attain to a fuller development and
          a more distinct expression is perhaps principally to be ascribed to
          the fact that it was not confined by an element quite foreign to
          it, as Christianity is by the Jewish theology, to which its sublime
          author had necessarily to adopt and accommodate it, partly
          consciously, partly, it may be, unconsciously. Thus Christianity
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page501">[pg 501]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg501"></a> is made up of two
          very different constituent parts, and I should like to call the
          purely ethical part especially and indeed exclusively Christian,
          and distinguish it from the Jewish dogmatism with which it is
          combined. If, as has often been feared, and especially at the
          present time, that excellent and salutary religion should
          altogether decline, I should look for the reason of this simply in
          the fact that it does not consist of one single element, but of two
          originally different elements, which have only been combined
          through the accident of history. In such a case dissolution had to
          follow through the separation of these elements, arising from their
          different relationship to and reaction against the progressive
          spirit of the age. But even after this dissolution the purely
          ethical part must always remain uninjured, because it is
          indestructible. Our knowledge of Hindu literature is still very
          imperfect. Yet, as we find their ethical teaching variously and
          powerfully expressed in the Vedas, Puranas, poems, myths, legends
          of their saints, maxims and precepts,<a href="#note_85" id="noteref_85" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">85</span></span></a> we see
          that it inculcates love of our neighbour with complete renunciation
          of self-love; love generally, not confined to mankind, but
          including all living creatures; benevolence, even to the giving
          away of the hard-won wages of daily toil; unlimited patience
          towards all who injure us; the requital of all wickedness, however
          base, with goodness and love; voluntary and glad endurance of all
          ignominy; abstinence from all animal food; perfect chastity and
          renunciation of all sensual pleasure <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page502">[pg 502]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg502"></a> for him who strives after true holiness; the
          surrender of all possessions, the forsaking of every dwelling-place
          and of all relatives; deep unbroken solitude, spent in silent
          contemplation, with voluntary penance and terrible slow
          self-torture for the absolute mortification of the will, torture
          which extends to voluntary death by starvation, or by men giving
          themselves up to crocodiles, or flinging themselves over the sacred
          precipice in the Himalayas, or being buried alive, or, finally, by
          flinging themselves under the wheels of the huge car of an idol
          drawn along amid the singing, shouting, and dancing of bayaderes.
          And even yet these precepts, whose origin reaches back more than
          four thousand years, are carried out in practice, in some cases
          even to the utmost extreme,<a href="#note_86" id="noteref_86" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">86</span></span></a> and
          this notwithstanding the fact that the Hindu nation has been broken
          up into so many parts. A religion which demands the greatest
          sacrifices, and which has yet remained so long in practice in a
          nation that embraces so many millions of persons, cannot be an
          arbitrarily invented superstition, but must have its foundation in
          the nature of man. But besides this, if we read the life of a
          Christian penitent or saint, and also that of a Hindu saint, we
          cannot sufficiently wonder at the harmony we find between them. In
          the case of such radically different dogmas, customs, and
          circumstances, the inward life and effort of both is the same. And
          the same harmony prevails in the maxims prescribed for both of
          them. For example, Tauler speaks of the absolute poverty which one
          ought to seek, and which consists in giving away and divesting
          oneself completely of everything from which one might draw comfort
          or worldly pleasure, clearly because all this constantly affords
          new nourishment to the will, which it is intended to destroy
          entirely. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page503">[pg
          503]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg503"></a>
          And as an Indian counterpart of this, we find in the precepts of Fo
          that the Saniassi, who ought to be without a dwelling and entirely
          without property, is further finally enjoined not to lay himself
          down often under the same tree, lest he should acquire a preference
          or inclination for it above other trees. The Christian mystic and
          the teacher of the Vedanta philosophy agree in this respect also,
          they both regard all outward works and religious exercises as
          superfluous for him who has attained to perfection. So much
          agreement in the case of such different ages and nations is a
          practical proof that what is expressed here is not, as optimistic
          dulness likes to assert, an eccentricity and perversity of the
          mind, but an essential side of human nature, which only appears so
          rarely because of its excellence.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I have now
          indicated the sources from which there may be obtained a direct
          knowledge, drawn from life itself, of the phenomena in which the
          denial of the will to live exhibits itself. In some respects this
          is the most important point of our whole work; yet I have only
          explained it quite generally, for it is better to refer to those
          who speak from direct experience, than to increase the size of this
          book unduly by weak repetitions of what is said by them.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I only wish to
          add a little to the general indication of the nature of this state.
          We saw above that the wicked man, by the vehemence of his volition,
          suffers constant, consuming, inward pain, and finally, if all
          objects of volition are exhausted, quenches the fiery thirst of his
          self-will by the sight of the suffering of others. He, on the
          contrary, who has attained to the denial of the will to live,
          however poor, joyless, and full of privation his condition may
          appear when looked at externally, is yet filled with inward joy and
          the true peace of heaven. It is not the restless strain of life,
          the jubilant delight which has keen suffering as its preceding or
          succeeding condition, in the experience of the man who loves life;
          but it is a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page504">[pg
          504]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg504"></a>
          peace that cannot be shaken, a deep rest and inward serenity, a
          state which we cannot behold without the greatest longing when it
          is brought before our eyes or our imagination, because we at once
          recognise it as that which alone is right, infinitely surpassing
          everything else, upon which our better self cries within us the
          great <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">sapere aude</span></span>.
          Then we feel that every gratification of our wishes won from the
          world is merely like the alms which the beggar receives from life
          to-day that he may hunger again on the morrow; resignation, on the
          contrary, is like an inherited estate, it frees the owner for ever
          from all care.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It will be
          remembered from the Third Book that the æsthetic pleasure in the
          beautiful consists in great measure in the fact that in entering
          the state of pure contemplation we are lifted for the moment above
          all willing, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, all wishes and cares; we
          become, as it were, freed from ourselves. We are no longer the
          individual whose knowledge is subordinated to the service of its
          constant willing, the correlative of the particular thing to which
          objects are motives, but the eternal subject of knowing purified
          from will, the correlative of the Platonic Idea. And we know that
          these moments in which, delivered from the ardent strain of will,
          we seem to rise out of the heavy atmosphere of earth, are the
          happiest which we experience. From this we can understand how
          blessed the life of a man must be whose will is silenced, not
          merely for a moment, as in the enjoyment of the beautiful, but for
          ever, indeed altogether extinguished, except as regards the last
          glimmering spark that retains the body in life, and will be
          extinguished with its death. Such a man, who, after many bitter
          struggles with his own nature, has finally conquered entirely,
          continues to exist only as a pure, knowing being, the undimmed
          mirror of the world. Nothing can trouble him more, nothing can move
          him, for he has cut all the thousand cords of will which hold us
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page505">[pg 505]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg505"></a> bound to the world,
          and, as desire, fear, envy, anger, drag us hither and thither in
          constant pain. He now looks back smiling and at rest on the
          delusions of this world, which once were able to move and agonise
          his spirit also, but which now stand before him as utterly
          indifferent to him, as the chess-men when the game is ended, or as,
          in the morning, the cast-off masquerading dress which worried and
          disquieted us in a night in Carnival. Life and its forms now pass
          before him as a fleeting illusion, as a light morning dream before
          half-waking eyes, the real world already shining through it so that
          it can no longer deceive; and like this morning dream, they finally
          vanish altogether without any violent transition. From this we can
          understand the meaning of Madame Guion when towards the end of her
          autobiography she often expresses herself thus: <span class="tei tei-q">“Everything is alike to me; I <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cannot</span></em>
          will anything more: often I know not whether I exist or
          not.”</span> In order to express how, after the extinction of the
          will, the death of the body (which is indeed only the manifestation
          of the will, and therefore loses all significance when the will is
          abolished) can no longer have any bitterness, but is very welcome,
          I may be allowed to quote the words of that holy penitent, although
          they are not very elegantly turned: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">Midi de la gloire; jour où il
          n'y a plus de nuit; vie qui ne craint plus la mort, dans la mort
          même: parceque la mort a vaincu la mort, et que celui qui a
          souffert la première mort, ne goutera plus la seconde
          mort</span></span>”</span> (Vie de Mad. de Guion, vol. ii. p.
          13).</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We must not,
          however, suppose that when, by means of the knowledge which acts as
          a quieter of will, the denial of the will to live has once
          appeared, it never wavers or vacillates, and that we can rest upon
          it as on an assured possession. Rather, it must ever anew be
          attained by a constant battle. For since the body is the will
          itself only in the form of objectivity or as manifestation in the
          world as idea, so long as the body lives, the whole <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page506">[pg 506]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg506"></a> will to live exists potentially, and
          constantly strives to become actual, and to burn again with all its
          ardour. Therefore that peace and blessedness in the life of holy
          men which we have described is only found as the flower which
          proceeds from the constant victory over the will, and the ground in
          which it grows is the constant battle with the will to live, for no
          one can have lasting peace upon earth. We therefore see the
          histories of the inner life of saints full of spiritual conflicts,
          temptations, and absence of grace, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          the kind of knowledge which makes all motives ineffectual, and as
          an universal quieter silences all volition, gives the deepest peace
          and opens the door of freedom. Therefore also we see those who have
          once attained to the denial of the will to live strive with all
          their might to keep upon this path, by enforced renunciation of
          every kind, by penance and severity of life, and by selecting
          whatever is disagreeable to them, all in order to suppress the
          will, which is constantly springing up anew. Hence, finally,
          because they already know the value of salvation, their anxious
          carefulness to retain the hard-won blessing, their scruples of
          conscience about every innocent pleasure, or about every little
          excitement of their vanity, which here also dies last, the most
          immovable, the most active, and the most foolish of all the
          inclinations of man. By the term <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">asceticism</span></em>, which I have used so
          often, I mean in its narrower sense this <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intentional</span></em> breaking of the will
          by the refusal of what is agreeable and the selection of what is
          disagreeable, the voluntarily chosen life of penance and
          self-chastisement for the continual mortification of the will.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We see this
          practised by him who has attained to the denial of the will in
          order to enable him to persist in it; but suffering in general, as
          it is inflicted by fate, is a second way (δευτερος πλους<a href="#note_87" id="noteref_87" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">87</span></span></a>) of
          attaining to that denial. Indeed, we may assume that most men only
          attain to it in this way, and that it is the suffering which is
          personally <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page507">[pg
          507]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg507"></a>
          experienced, not that which is merely known, which most frequently
          produces complete resignation, often only at the approach of death.
          For only in the case of a few is the mere knowledge which, seeing
          through the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium
          individuationis</span></span>, first produces perfect goodness of
          disposition and universal love of humanity, and finally enables
          them to regard all the suffering of the world as their own; only in
          the case of a few, I say, is this knowledge sufficient to bring
          about the denial of the will. Even with him who approaches this
          point, it is almost invariably the case that the tolerable
          condition of his own body, the flattery of the moment, the delusion
          of hope, and the satisfaction of the will, which is ever presenting
          itself anew, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, lust, is a constant
          hindrance to the denial of the will, and a constant temptation to
          the renewed assertion of it. Therefore in this respect all these
          illusions have been personified as the devil. Thus in most cases
          the will must be broken by great personal suffering before its
          self-conquest appears. Then we see the man who has passed through
          all the increasing degrees of affliction with the most vehement
          resistance, and is finally brought to the verge of despair,
          suddenly retire into himself, know himself and the world, change
          his whole nature, rise above himself and all suffering, as if
          purified and sanctified by it, in inviolable peace, blessedness,
          and sublimity, willingly renounce everything he previously desired
          with all his might, and joyfully embrace death. It is the refined
          silver of the denial of the will to live that suddenly comes forth
          from the purifying flame of suffering. It is salvation. Sometimes
          we see even those who were very wicked purified to this degree by
          great grief; they have become new beings and are completely
          changed. Therefore their former misdeeds trouble their consciences
          no more, yet they willingly atone for them by death, and gladly see
          the end of the manifestation of that will which is now foreign to
          them and abhorred by them. The great <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page508">[pg 508]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg508"></a> Goethe has given us a distinct and visible
          representation of this denial of the will, brought about by great
          misfortunes and despair of all deliverance, in his immortal
          masterpiece <span class="tei tei-q">“Faust,”</span> in the story of
          the sufferings of Gretchen. I know no parallel to this in poetry.
          It is a perfect example of the second path that leads to the denial
          of the will, not, as the first, through the mere knowledge of the
          sufferings of a whole world which one has voluntarily acquired, but
          through excessive suffering experienced in one's own person. Many
          tragedies certainly end by conducting their strong-willed heroes to
          the point of entire resignation, and then generally the will to
          live and its manifestation end together, but no representation that
          is known to me brings what is essential to that change so
          distinctly before us, free from all that is extraneous, as the part
          of <span class="tei tei-q">“Faust”</span> I have referred to.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In actual life
          we see that those unfortunate persons who have to drink to the
          dregs the greatest cup of suffering, since when all hope is taken
          from them they have to face with full consciousness a shameful,
          violent, and often painful death on the scaffold, are very
          frequently changed in this way. We must not indeed assume that
          there is so great a difference between their character and that of
          most men as their fate would seem to indicate, but must attribute
          the latter for the most part to circumstances; yet they are guilty
          and to a considerable degree bad. We see, however, many of them,
          when they have entirely lost hope, changed in the way referred to.
          They now show actual goodness and purity of disposition, true
          abhorrence of doing any act in the least degree bad or unkind. They
          forgive their enemies, even if it is through them that they
          innocently suffer; and not with words merely and a sort of
          hypocritical fear of the judges of the lower world, but in reality
          and with inward earnestness and no desire for revenge. Indeed,
          their sufferings and death at last becomes dear to them, for the
          denial of the will to live has appeared; they often decline the
          deliverance <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page509">[pg
          509]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg509"></a>
          when it is offered, and die gladly, peacefully, and happily. To
          them the last secret of life has revealed itself in their excessive
          pain; the secret that misery and wickedness, sorrow and hate, the
          sufferer and the inflicter of suffering, however different they may
          appear to the knowledge which follows the principle of sufficient
          reason, are in themselves one, the manifestation of that one will
          to live which objectifies its conflict with itself by means of the
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium individuationis</span></span>. They
          have learned to know both sides in full measure, the badness and
          the misery; and since at last they see the identity of the two,
          they reject them both at once; they deny the will to live. In what
          myths and dogmas they account to their reason for this intuitive
          and direct knowledge and for their own change is, as has been said,
          a matter of no importance.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Matthias
          Claudius must without doubt have witnessed a change of mind of this
          description when he wrote the remarkable essay in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Wandsbecker Boten”</span> (pt. i. p. 115) with the
          title <span class="tei tei-q">“Bekehrungsgeschichte des ***”</span>

          forsakes father and mother if he can hear or experience something
          certain about it.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The approach of
          death and hopelessness are in other respects not absolutely
          necessary for such a purification through suffering. Even without
          them the knowledge of the contradiction of the will to live with
          itself can, through <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page510">[pg
          510]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg510"></a>
          great misfortune and pain, force an entrance, and the vanity of all
          striving become recognised. Hence it has often happened that men
          who have led a very restless life in the full strain of the
          passions, kings, heroes, and adventurers, suddenly change, betake
          themselves to resignation and penance, become hermits or monks. To
          this class belong all true accounts of conversions; for example,
          that of Raymond Lully, who had long wooed a fair lady, and was at
          last admitted to her chamber, anticipating the fulfilment of all
          his wishes, when she, opening her bodice, showed him her bosom
          frightfully eaten with cancer. From that moment, as if he had
          looked into hell, he was changed; he forsook the court of the king
          of Majorca, and went into the desert to do penance.<a href="#note_88" id="noteref_88" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">88</span></span></a> This
          conversion is very like that of the Abbé Rancé, which I have
          briefly related in the 48th chapter of the Supplement. If we
          consider how in both cases the transition from the pleasure to the
          horror of life was the occasion of it, this throws some light upon
          the remarkable fact that it is among the French, the most cheerful,
          gay, sensuous, and frivolous nation in Europe, that by far the
          strictest of all monastic orders, the Trappists, arose, was
          re-established by Rancé after its fall, and has maintained itself
          to the present day in all its purity and strictness, in spite of
          revolutions, Church reformations, and encroachments of
          infidelity.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But a knowledge
          such as that referred to above of the nature of this existence may
          leave us again along with the occasion of it and the will to live,
          and with it the previous character may reappear. Thus we see that
          the passionate Benvenuto Cellini was changed in this way, once when
          he was in prison, and again when very ill; but when the suffering
          passed over, he fell back again into his old state. In general, the
          denial of the will to live by no means proceeds from suffering with
          the necessity of an effect from its cause, but the will remains
          free; <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page511">[pg 511]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg511"></a> for this is indeed
          the one point at which its freedom appears directly in the
          phenomenon; hence the astonishment which Asmus expresses so
          strongly at the <span class="tei tei-q">“transcendental
          change.”</span> In the case of every suffering, it is always
          possible to conceive a will which exceeds it in intensity and is
          therefore unconquered by it. Thus Plato speaks in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Phædon”</span> of men who up to the moment of their
          execution feast, drink, and indulge in sensuous pleasure, asserting
          life even to the death. Shakespeare shows us in Cardinal Beaufort
          the fearful end of a profligate, who dies full of despair, for no
          suffering or death can break his will, which is vehement to the
          extreme of wickedness.<a href="#note_89" id="noteref_89" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">89</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The more intense
          the will is, the more glaring is the conflict of its manifestation,
          and thus the greater is the suffering. A world which was the
          manifestation of a far more intense will to live than this world
          manifests would produce so much the greater suffering; would thus
          be a hell.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All suffering,
          since it is a mortification and a call to resignation, has
          potentially a sanctifying power. This is the explanation of the
          fact that every great misfortune or deep pain inspires a certain
          awe. But the sufferer only really becomes an object of reverence
          when, surveying the course of his life as a chain of sorrows, or
          mourning some great and incurable misfortune, he does not really
          look at the special combination of circumstances which has plunged
          his own life into suffering, nor stops at the single great
          misfortune that has befallen him; for in so doing his knowledge
          still follows the principle of sufficient reason, and clings to the
          particular phenomenon; he still wills life only not under the
          conditions which have happened to him; but only then, I say, he is
          truly worthy of reverence when he raises his glance from the
          particular to the universal, when he regards his suffering as
          merely an example of the whole, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page512">[pg 512]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg512"></a> and for him, since in a moral regard he
          partakes of genius, one case stands for a thousand, so that the
          whole of life conceived as essentially suffering brings him to
          resignation. Therefore it inspires reverence when in Goethe's
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Torquato Tasso”</span> the princess speaks
          of how her own life and that of her relations has always been sad
          and joyless, and yet regards the matter from an entirely universal
          point of view.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A very noble
          character we always imagine with a certain trace of quiet sadness,
          which is anything but a constant fretfulness at daily annoyances
          (this would be an ignoble trait, and lead us to fear a bad
          disposition), but is a consciousness derived from knowledge of the
          vanity of all possessions, of the suffering of all life, not merely
          of his own. But such knowledge may primarily be awakened by the
          personal experience of suffering, especially some one great sorrow,
          as a single unfulfilled wish brought Petrarch to that state of
          resigned sadness concerning the whole of life which appeals to us
          so pathetically in his works; for the Daphne he pursued had to flee
          from his hands in order to leave him, instead of herself, the
          immortal laurel. When through some such great and irrevocable
          denial of fate the will is to some extent broken, almost nothing
          else is desired, and the character shows itself mild, just, noble,
          and resigned. When, finally, grief has no definite object, but
          extends itself over the whole of life, then it is to a certain
          extent a going into itself, a withdrawal, a gradual disappearance
          of the will, whose visible manifestation, the body, it
          imperceptibly but surely undermines, so that a man feels a certain
          loosening of his bonds, a mild foretaste of that death which
          promises to be the abolition at once of the body and of the will.
          Therefore a secret pleasure accompanies this grief, and it is this,
          as I believe, which the most melancholy of all nations has called
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the joy of grief.”</span> But here also
          lies the danger of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sentimentality</span></em>, both in life
          itself and in the representation of it in poetry; when a man is
          always mourning and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page513">[pg
          513]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg513"></a>
          lamenting without courageously rising to resignation. In this way
          we lose both earth and heaven, and retain merely a watery
          sentimentality. Only if suffering assumes the form of pure
          knowledge, and this, acting as a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">quieter of the
          will</span></em>, brings about resignation, is it worthy of
          reverence. In this regard, however, we feel a certain respect at
          the sight of every great sufferer which is akin to the feeling
          excited by virtue and nobility of character, and also seems like a
          reproach of our own happy condition. We cannot help regarding every
          sorrow, both our own and those of others, as at least a potential
          advance towards virtue and holiness, and, on the contrary,
          pleasures and worldly satisfactions as a retrogression from them.
          This goes so far, that every man who endures a great bodily or
          mental suffering, indeed every one who merely performs some
          physical labour which demands the greatest exertion, in the sweat
          of his brow and with evident exhaustion, yet with patience and
          without murmuring, every such man, I say, if we consider him with
          close attention, appears to us like a sick man who tries a painful
          cure, and who willingly, and even with satisfaction, endures the
          suffering it causes him, because he knows that the more he suffers
          the more the cause of his disease is affected, and that therefore
          the present suffering is the measure of his cure.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">According to
          what has been said, the denial of the will to live, which is just
          what is called absolute, entire resignation, or holiness, always
          proceeds from that quieter of the will which the knowledge of its
          inner conflict and essential vanity, expressing themselves in the
          suffering of all living things, becomes. The difference, which we
          have represented as two paths, consists in whether that knowledge
          is called up by suffering which is merely and purely <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">known</span></em>,
          and is freely appropriated by means of the penetration of the
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium individuationis</span></span>, or
          by suffering which is directly <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">felt</span></em> by
          a man himself. True salvation, deliverance from life and suffering,
          cannot even be imagined without complete denial of the will. Till
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page514">[pg 514]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg514"></a> then, every one is
          simply this will itself, whose manifestation is an ephemeral
          existence, a constantly vain and empty striving, and the world full
          of suffering we have represented, to which all irrevocably and in
          like manner belong. For we found above that life is always assured
          to the will to live, and its one real form is the present, from
          which they can never escape, since birth and death reign in the
          phenomenal world. The Indian mythus expresses this by saying
          <span class="tei tei-q">“they are born again.”</span> The great
          ethical difference of character means this, that the bad man is
          infinitely far from the attainment of the knowledge from which the
          denial of the will proceeds, and therefore he is in truth
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">actually</span></em> exposed to all the
          miseries which appear in life as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">possible</span></em>; for even the present
          fortunate condition of his personality is merely a phenomenon
          produced by the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium
          individuationis</span></span>, and a delusion of Mâyâ, the happy
          dream of a beggar. The sufferings which in the vehemence and ardour
          of his will he inflicts upon others are the measure of the
          suffering, the experience of which in his own person cannot break
          his will, and plainly lead it to the denial of itself. All true and
          pure love, on the other hand, and even all free justice, proceed
          from the penetration of the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium
          individuationis</span></span>, which, if it appears with its full
          power, results in perfect sanctification and salvation, the
          phenomenon of which is the state of resignation described above,
          the unbroken peace which accompanies it, and the greatest delight
          in death.<a href="#note_90" id="noteref_90" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">90</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 69. Suicide,
          the actual doing away with the individual manifestation of will,
          differs most widely from the denial of the will to live, which is
          the single outstanding act of free-will in the manifestation, and
          is therefore, as Asmus calls it, the transcendental change. This
          last has been fully considered in the course of our work. Far from
          being denial of the will, suicide is a phenomenon of strong
          assertion of will; for the essence of negation lies <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page515">[pg 515]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg515"></a> in this, that the joys of life are
          shunned, not its sorrows. The suicide wills life, and is only
          dissatisfied with the conditions under which it has presented
          itself to him. He therefore by no means surrenders the will to
          live, but only life, in that he destroys the individual
          manifestation. He wills life—wills the unrestricted existence and
          assertion of the body; but the complication of circumstances does
          not allow this, and there results for him great suffering. The very
          will to live finds itself so much hampered in this particular
          manifestation that it cannot put forth its energies. It therefore
          comes to such a determination as is in conformity with its own
          nature, which lies outside the conditions of the principle of
          sufficient reason, and to which, therefore, all particular
          manifestations are alike indifferent, inasmuch as it itself remains
          unaffected by all appearing and passing away, and is the inner life
          of all things; for that firm inward assurance by reason of which we
          all live free from the constant dread of death, the assurance that
          a phenomenal existence can never be wanting to the will, supports
          our action even in the case of suicide. Thus the will to live
          appears just as much in suicide (Siva) as in the satisfaction of
          self-preservation (Vishnu) and in the sensual pleasure of
          procreation (Brahma). This is the inner meaning of the unity of the
          Trimurtis, which is embodied in its entirety in every human being,
          though in time it raises now one, now another, of its three heads.
          Suicide stands in the same relation to the denial of the will as
          the individual thing does to the Idea. The suicide denies only the
          individual, not the species. We have already seen that as life is
          always assured to the will to live, and as sorrow is inseparable
          from life, suicide, the wilful destruction of the single phenomenal
          existence, is a vain and foolish act; for the thing-in-itself
          remains unaffected by it, even as the rainbow endures however fast
          the drops which support it for the moment may change. But, more
          than this, it is also the masterpiece of Mâyâ, as the most
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page516">[pg 516]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg516"></a> flagrant example of
          the contradiction of the will to live with itself. As we found this
          contradiction in the case of the lowest manifestations of will, in
          the permanent struggle of all the forces of nature, and of all
          organic individuals for matter and time and space; and as we saw
          this antagonism come ever more to the front with terrible
          distinctness in the ascending grades of the objectification of the
          will, so at last in the highest grade, the Idea of man, it reaches
          the point at which, not only the individuals which express the same
          Idea extirpate each other, but even the same individual declares
          war against itself. The vehemence with which it wills life, and
          revolts against what hinders it, namely, suffering, brings it to
          the point of destroying itself; so that the individual will, by its
          own act, puts an end to that body which is merely its particular
          visible expression, rather than permit suffering to break the will.
          Just because the suicide cannot give up willing, he gives up
          living. The will asserts itself here even in putting an end to its
          own manifestation, because it can no longer assert itself
          otherwise. As, however, it was just the suffering which it so shuns
          that was able, as mortification of the will, to bring it to the
          denial of itself, and hence to freedom, so in this respect the
          suicide is like a sick man, who, after a painful operation which
          would entirely cure him has been begun, will not allow it to be
          completed, but prefers to retain his disease. Suffering approaches
          and reveals itself as the possibility of the denial of will; but
          the will rejects it, in that it destroys the body, the
          manifestation of itself, in order that it may remain unbroken. This
          is the reason why almost all ethical teachers, whether
          philosophical or religious, condemn suicide, although they
          themselves can only give far-fetched sophistical reasons for their
          opinion. But if a human being was ever restrained from committing
          suicide by purely moral motives, the inmost meaning of this
          self-conquest (in whatever ideas his reason may <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page517">[pg 517]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg517"></a> have clothed it) was this: <span class="tei tei-q">“I will not shun suffering, in order that it may help
          to put an end to the will to live, whose manifestation is so
          wretched, by so strengthening the knowledge of the real nature of
          the world which is already beginning to dawn upon me, that it may
          become the final quieter of my will, and may free me for
          ever.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is well known
          that from time to time cases occur in which the act of suicide
          extends to the children. The father first kills the children he
          loves, and then himself. Now, if we consider that conscience,
          religion, and all influencing ideas teach him to look upon murder
          as the greatest of crimes, and that, in spite of this, he yet
          commits it, in the hour of his own death, and when he is altogether
          uninfluenced by any egotistical motive, such a deed can only be
          explained in the following manner: in this case, the will of the
          individual, the father, recognises itself immediately in the
          children, though involved in the delusion of mistaking the
          appearance for the true nature; and as he is at the same time
          deeply impressed with the knowledge of the misery of all life, he
          now thinks to put an end to the inner nature itself, along with the
          appearance, and thus seeks to deliver from existence and its misery
          both himself and his children, in whom he discerns himself as
          living again. It would be an error precisely analogous to this to
          suppose that one may reach the same end as is attained through
          voluntary chastity by frustrating the aim of nature in fecundation;
          or indeed if, in consideration of the unendurable suffering of
          life, parents were to use means for the destruction of their
          new-born children, instead of doing everything possible to ensure
          life to that which is struggling into it. For if the will to live
          is there, as it is the only metaphysical reality, or the
          thing-in-itself, no physical force can break it, but can only
          destroy its manifestation at this place and time. It itself can
          never be transcended except through <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page518">[pg 518]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg518"></a> knowledge. Thus the only way of salvation is,
          that the will shall manifest itself unrestrictedly, in order that
          in this individual manifestation it may come to apprehend its own
          nature. Only as the result of this knowledge can the will transcend
          itself, and thereby end the suffering which is inseparable from its
          manifestation. It is quite impossible to accomplish this end by
          physical force, as by destroying the germ, or by killing the
          new-born child, or by committing suicide. Nature guides the will to
          the light, just because it is only in the light that it can work
          out its salvation. Therefore the aims of Nature are to be promoted
          in every way as soon as the will to live, which is its inner being,
          has determined itself.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is a
          species of suicide which seems to be quite distinct from the common
          kind, though its occurrence has perhaps not yet been fully
          established. It is starvation, voluntarily chosen on the ground of
          extreme asceticism. All instances of it, however, have been
          accompanied and obscured by much religious fanaticism, and even
          superstition. Yet it seems that the absolute denial of will may
          reach the point at which the will shall be wanting to take the
          necessary nourishment for the support of the natural life. This
          kind of suicide is so far from being the result of the will to
          live, that such a completely resigned ascetic only ceases to live
          because he has already altogether ceased to will. No other death
          than that by starvation is in this case conceivable (unless it were
          the result of some special superstition); for the intention to cut
          short the torment would itself be a stage in the assertion of will.
          The dogmas which satisfy the reason of such a penitent delude him
          with the idea that a being of a higher nature has inculcated the
          fasting to which his own inner tendency drives him. Old examples of
          this may be found in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Breslauer
          Sammlung von Natur- und Medicin-Geschichten,”</span> September
          1799, p. 363; in Bayle's <span class="tei tei-q">“Nouvelles de la
          République <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page519">[pg

          182; in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Histoire de l'Académie des
          Sciences”</span> for 1764, an account by Houttuyn, which is quoted
          in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Sammlung für praktische
          Aerzte,”</span> vol. i. p. 69. More recent accounts may be found in
          Hufeland's <span class="tei tei-q">“Journal für praktische
          Heilkunde,”</span> vol. x. p. 181, and vol. xlviii. p. 95; also in

          vol. v. p. 319. In the year 1833 all the papers announced that the
          English historian, Dr. Lingard, had died in January at Dover of
          voluntary starvation; according to later accounts, it was not he
          himself, but a relation of his who died. Still in these accounts
          the persons were generally described as insane, and it is no longer
          possible to find out how far this was the case. But I will give
          here a more recent case of this kind, if it were only to ensure the
          preservation of one of the rare instances of this striking and
          extraordinary phenomenon of human nature, which, to all appearance
          at any rate, belongs to the category to which I wish to assign it
          and could hardly be explained in any other way. This case is
          reported in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Nürnberger
          Correspondenten”</span> of the 29th July 1813, in these
          words:—<span class="tei tei-q">“We hear from Bern that in a thick
          wood near Thurnen a hut has been discovered in which was lying the
          body of a man who had been dead about a month. His clothes gave
          little or no clue to his social position. Two very fine shirts lay
          beside him. The most important article, however, was a Bible
          interleaved with white paper, part of which had been written upon
          by the deceased. In this writing he gives the date of his departure
          from home (but does not mention where his home was). He then says
          that he was driven by the Spirit of God into the wilderness to pray
          and fast. During his journey he had fasted seven days and then he
          had again taken food. After this he had begun again to fast, and
          continued to do so for <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page520">[pg
          520]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg520"></a>
          the same number of days as before. From this point we find each day
          marked with a stroke, and of these there are five, at the
          expiration of which the pilgrim presumably died. There was further
          found a letter to a clergyman about a sermon which the deceased
          heard him preach, but the letter was not addressed.”</span> Between
          this voluntary death arising from extreme asceticism and the common
          suicide resulting from despair there may be various intermediate
          species and combinations, though this is hard to find out. But
          human nature has depths, obscurities, and perplexities, the
          analysis and elucidation of which is a matter of the very greatest
          difficulty.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 70. It might
          be supposed that the entire exposition (now terminated) of that
          which I call the denial of the will is irreconcilable with the
          earlier explanation of necessity, which belongs just as much to
          motivation as to every other form of the principle of sufficient
          reason, and according to which, motives, like all causes, are only
          occasional causes, upon which the character unfolds its nature and
          reveals it with the necessity of a natural law, on account of which
          we absolutely denied freedom as <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">liberum arbitrium indifferentiæ</span></span>.
          But far from suppressing this here, I would call it to mind. In
          truth, real freedom, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, independence of the
          principle of sufficient reason, belongs to the will only as a
          thing-in-itself, not to its manifestation, whose essential form is
          everywhere the principle of sufficient reason, the element or
          sphere of necessity. But the one case in which that freedom can
          become directly visible in the manifestation is that in which it
          makes an end of what manifests itself, and because the mere
          manifestation, as a link in the chain of causes, the living body in
          time, which contains only phenomena, still continues to exist, the
          will which manifests itself through this phenomenon then stands in
          contradiction to it, for it denies what the phenomenon expresses.
          In such a case the organs of generation, for example, as the
          visible form of the sexual impulse, are <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page521">[pg 521]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg521"></a> there and in health; but yet, in the inmost
          consciousness, no sensual gratification is desired; and although
          the whole body is only the visible expression of the will to live,
          yet the motives which correspond to this will no longer act;
          indeed, the dissolution of the body, the end of the individual, and
          in this way the greatest check to the natural will, is welcome and
          desired. Now, the contradiction between our assertions of the
          necessity of the determination of the will by motives, in
          accordance with the character, on the one hand, and of the
          possibility of the entire suppression of the will whereby the
          motives become powerless, on the other hand, is only the repetition
          in the reflection of philosophy of this <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real</span></em>
          contradiction which arises from the direct encroachment of the
          freedom of the will-in-itself, which knows no necessity, into the
          sphere of the necessity of its manifestation. But the key to the
          solution of these contradictions lies in the fact that the state in
          which the character is withdrawn from the power of motives does not
          proceed directly from the will, but from a changed form of
          knowledge. So long as the knowledge is merely that which is
          involved in the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium
          individuationis</span></span> and exclusively follows the principle
          of sufficient reason, the strength of the motives is irresistible.
          But when the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium
          individuationis</span></span> is seen through, when the Ideas, and
          indeed the inner nature of the thing-in-itself, as the same will in
          all, are directly recognised, and from this knowledge an universal
          quieter of volition arises, then the particular motives become
          ineffective, because the kind of knowledge which corresponds to
          them is obscured and thrown into the background by quite another
          kind. Therefore the character can never partially change, but must,
          with the consistency of a law of Nature, carry out in the
          particular the will which it manifests as a whole. But this whole,
          the character itself, may be completely suppressed or abolished
          through the change of knowledge referred to above. It is this
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page522">[pg 522]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg522"></a> suppression or
          abolition which Asmus, as quoted above, marvels at and denotes the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“catholic, transcendental change;”</span>
          and in the Christian Church it has very aptly been called the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">new
          birth</span></em>, and the knowledge from which it springs, the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">work of
          grace</span></em>. Therefore it is not a question of a change, but
          of an entire suppression of the character; and hence it arises
          that, however different the characters which experience the
          suppression may have been before it, after it they show a great
          similarity in their conduct, though every one still speaks very
          differently according to his conceptions and dogmas.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this sense,
          then, the old philosophical doctrine of the freedom of the will,
          which has constantly been contested and constantly maintained, is
          not without ground, and the dogma of the Church of the work of
          grace and the new birth is not without meaning and significance.
          But we now unexpectedly see both united in one, and we can also now
          understand in what sense the excellent Malebranche could say,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">La liberté est un
          mystère</span></span>,”</span> and was right. For precisely what
          the Christian mystics call <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the work of grace</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the new
          birth</span></em>, is for us the single direct expression of
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the
          freedom of the will</span></em>. It only appears if the will,
          having attained to a knowledge of its own real nature, receives
          from this a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">quieter</span></em>, by means of which the
          motives are deprived of their effect, which belongs to the province
          of another kind of knowledge, the objects of which are merely
          phenomena. The possibility of the freedom which thus expresses
          itself is the greatest prerogative of man, which is for ever
          wanting to the brute, because the condition of it is the
          deliberation of reason, which enables him to survey the whole of
          life independent of the impression of the present. The brute is
          entirely without the possibility of freedom, as, indeed, it is
          without the possibility of a proper or deliberate choice following
          upon a completed conflict of motives, which for this purpose would
          have to be abstract ideas. Therefore with the same necessity with
          which <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page523">[pg 523]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg523"></a> the stone falls to
          the earth, the hungry wolf buries its fangs in the flesh of its
          prey, without the possibility of the knowledge that it is itself
          the destroyed as well as the destroyer. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Necessity is the
          kingdom of nature; freedom is the kingdom of grace.</span></em></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now because, as
          we have seen, that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">self-suppression of the will</span></em>
          proceeds from knowledge, and all knowledge is involuntary, that
          denial of will also, that entrance into freedom, cannot be forcibly
          attained to by intention or design, but proceeds from the inmost
          relation of knowing and volition in the man, and therefore comes
          suddenly, as if spontaneously from without. This is why the Church
          has called it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the work of grace</span></em>; and that it
          still regards it as independent of the acceptance of grace
          corresponds to the fact that the effect of the quieter is finally a
          free act of will. And because, in consequence of such a work of
          grace, the whole nature of man is changed and reversed from its
          foundation, so that he no longer wills anything of all that he
          previously willed so intensely, so that it is as if a new man
          actually took the place of the old, the Church has called this
          consequence of the work of grace the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">new
          birth</span></em>. For what it calls the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">natural
          man</span></em>, to which it denies all capacity for good, is just
          the will to live, which must be denied if deliverance from an
          existence such as ours is to be attained. Behind our existence lies
          something else, which is only accessible to us if we have shaken
          off this world.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having regard,
          not to the individuals according to the principle of sufficient
          reason, but to the Idea of man in its unity, Christian theology
          symbolises <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nature</span></em>, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">assertion of the
          will to live</span></em> in Adam, whose sin, inherited by us,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, our unity with him in the
          Idea, which is represented in time by the bond of procreation,
          makes us all partakers of suffering and eternal death. On the other
          hand, it symbolises <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">grace</span></em>, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">denial of the
          will</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">salvation</span></em>, in the incarnate God,
          who, as free from all sin, that is, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page524">[pg 524]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg524"></a> from all willing of life, cannot, like us,
          have proceeded from the most pronounced assertion of the will, nor
          can he, like us, have a body which is through and through simply
          concrete will, manifestation of the will; but born of a pure
          virgin, he has only a phantom body. This last is the doctrine of
          the Docetæ, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, certain Church Fathers,
          who in this respect are very consistent. It is especially taught by
          Apelles, against whom and his followers Tertullian wrote. But even
          Augustine comments thus on the passage, Rom. viii. 3, <span class="tei tei-q">“God sent his Son in the likeness of sinful
          flesh:”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Non enim caro peccati erat, quæ non de carnali
          delectatione nata erat: sed tamen inerat ei similitudo carnis
          peccati, quia mortalis caro erat</span></span>”</span> (Liber 83,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quæst.
          qu.</span></span> 66). He also teaches in his work entitled
          <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Opus Imperfectum</span></span>,”</span> i. 47,
          that inherited sin is both sin and punishment at once. It is
          already present in new-born children, but only shows itself if they
          grow up. Yet the origin of this sin is to be referred to the will
          of the sinner. This sinner was Adam, but we all existed in him;
          Adam became miserable, and in him we have all become miserable.
          Certainly the doctrine of original sin (assertion of the will) and
          of salvation (denial of the will) is the great truth which
          constitutes the essence of Christianity, while most of what remains
          is only the clothing of it, the husk or accessories. Therefore
          Jesus Christ ought always to be conceived in the universal, as the
          symbol or personification of the denial of the will to live, but
          never as an individual, whether according to his mythical history
          given in the Gospels, or according to the probably true history
          which lies at the foundation of this. For neither the one nor the
          other will easily satisfy us entirely. It is merely the vehicle of
          that conception for the people, who always demand something actual.
          That in recent times Christianity has forgotten its true
          significance, and degenerated into dull optimism, does not concern
          us here.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is further an
          original and evangelical doctrine of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page525">[pg 525]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg525"></a> Christianity—which Augustine, with the
          consent of the leaders of the Church, defended against the
          platitudes of the Pelagians, and which it was the principal aim of
          Luther's endeavour to purify from error and re-establish, as he
          expressly declares in his book, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De Servo Arbitrio</span></span>,”</span>—the
          doctrine that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the will is not free</span></em>, but
          originally subject to the inclination to evil. Therefore according
          to this doctrine the deeds of the will are always sinful and
          imperfect, and can never fully satisfy justice; and, finally, these
          works can never save us, but faith alone, a faith which itself does
          not spring from resolution and free will, but from the work of
          grace, without our co-operation, comes to us as from without.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Not only the
          dogmas referred to before, but also this last genuine evangelical
          dogma belongs to those which at the present day an ignorant and
          dull opinion rejects as absurd or hides. For, in spite of Augustine
          and Luther, it adheres to the vulgar Pelagianism, which the
          rationalism of the day really is, and treats as antiquated those
          deeply significant dogmas which are peculiar and essential to
          Christianity in the strictest sense; while, on the other hand, it
          holds fast and regards as the principal matter only the dogma that
          originates in Judaism, and has been retained from it, and is merely
          historically connected with Christianity.<a href="#note_91" id="noteref_91" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">91</span></span></a> We,
          however, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page526">[pg
          526]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg526"></a>
          recognise in the doctrine referred to above the truth completely
          agreeing with the result of our own investigations. We see that
          true virtue and holiness of disposition have their origin not in
          deliberate choice (works), but in knowledge (faith); just as we
          have in like manner developed it from our leading thought. If it
          were works, which spring from motives and deliberate intention,
          that led to salvation, then, however one may turn it, virtue would
          always be a prudent, methodical, far-seeing egoism. But the faith
          to which the Christian Church promises salvation is this: that as
          through the fall of the first man we are all partakers of sin and
          subject to death and perdition, through the divine substitute,
          through grace and the taking upon himself of our fearful guilt, we
          are all saved, without any merit of our own (of the person); since
          that which can proceed from the intentional (determined by motives)
          action of the person, works, can never justify us, from its very
          nature, just because it is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intentional</span></em>, action induced by
          motives, <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">opus operatum</span></span>.
          Thus in this faith there is implied, first of all, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page527">[pg 527]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg527"></a> that our condition is originally and
          essentially an incurable one, from which we need <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">salvation</span></em>; then, that we ourselves
          essentially belong to evil, and are so firmly bound to it that our
          works according to law and precept, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          according to motives, can never satisfy justice nor save us; but
          salvation is only obtained through faith, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          through a changed mode of knowing, and this faith can only come
          through grace, thus as from without. This means that the salvation
          is one which is quite foreign to our person, and points to a denial
          and surrender of this person necessary to salvation. Works, the
          result of the law as such, can never justify, because they are
          always action following upon motives. Luther demands (in his book
          <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De Libertate Christiana</span></span>”</span>)
          that after the entrance of faith the good works shall proceed from
          it entirely of themselves, as symptoms, as fruits of it; yet by no
          means as constituting in themselves a claim to merit,
          justification, or reward, but taking place quite voluntarily and
          gratuitously. So we also hold that from the ever-clearer
          penetration of the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium
          individuationis</span></span> proceeds, first, merely free justice,
          then love, extending to the complete abolition of egoism, and
          finally resignation or denial of the will.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I have here
          introduced these dogmas of Christian theology, which in themselves
          are foreign to philosophy, merely for the purpose of showing that
          the ethical doctrine which proceeds from our whole investigation,
          and is in complete agreement and connection with all its parts,
          although new and unprecedented in its expression, is by no means so
          in its real nature, but fully agrees with the Christian dogmas
          properly so called, and indeed, as regards its essence, was
          contained and present in them. It also agrees quite as accurately
          with the doctrines and ethical teachings of the sacred books of
          India, which in their turn are presented in quite different forms.
          At the same time the calling to mind of the dogmas of the Christian
          Church serves to explain and illustrate <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page528">[pg 528]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg528"></a> the apparent contradiction between the
          necessity of all expressions of character when motives are
          presented (the kingdom of Nature) on the one hand, and the freedom
          of the will in itself, to deny itself, and abolish the character
          with all the necessity of the motives based upon it (the kingdom of
          grace) on the other hand.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">§ 71. I now end
          the general account of ethics, and with it the whole development of
          that one thought which it has been my object to impart; and I by no
          means desire to conceal here an objection which concerns this last
          part of my exposition, but rather to point out that it lies in the
          nature of the question, and that it is quite impossible to remove
          it. It is this, that after our investigation has brought us to the
          point at which we have before our eyes perfect holiness, the denial
          and surrender of all volition, and thus the deliverance from a
          world whose whole existence we have found to be suffering, this
          appears to us as a passing away into empty nothingness.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On this I must
          first remark, that the conception of nothing is essentially
          relative, and always refers to a definite something which it
          negatives. This quality has been attributed (by Kant) merely to the
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">nihil privativum</span></span>, which is
          indicated by - as opposed to +, which -, from an opposite point of
          view, might become +, and in opposition to this <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">nihil privativum</span></span> the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">nihil negativum</span></span> has been set up,
          which would in every reference be nothing, and as an example of
          this the logical contradiction which does away with itself has been
          given. But more closely considered, no absolute nothing, no proper
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">nihil negativum</span></span> is even
          thinkable; but everything of this kind, when considered from a
          higher standpoint or subsumed under a wider concept, is always
          merely a <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">nihil
          privativum</span></span>. Every nothing is thought as such only in
          relation to something, and presupposes this relation, and thus also
          this something. Even a logical contradiction is only a relative
          nothing. It is no thought of the reason, but it is not on that
          account an absolute nothing; <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page529">[pg 529]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg529"></a> for it is a combination of words; it is an
          example of the unthinkable, which is necessary in logic in order to
          prove the laws of thought. Therefore if for this end such an
          example is sought, we will stick to the nonsense as the positive
          which we are in search of, and pass over the sense as the negative.
          Thus every <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">nihil
          negativum</span></span>, if subordinated to a higher concept, will
          appear as a mere <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">nihil
          privativum</span></span> or relative nothing, which can, moreover,
          always exchange signs with what it negatives, so that that would
          then be thought as negation, and it itself as assertion. This also
          agrees with the result of the difficult dialectical investigation
          of the meaning of nothing which Plato gives in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Sophist”</span> (pp. 277-287): Την του ἑτερου φυσιν
          αποδειξαντες ουσαν τε, και κατακεκερματισμενην επι παντα τα οντα
          προς αλληλα, το προς το ον ἑκαστου μοριου αυτης αντιτιθεμενον,
          ετολμησαμεν ειπειν, ὡς αυτο τουτο εστιν οντως το μη ον (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Cum enim ostenderemus, alterius ipsius naturam
          esse perque omnia entia divisam atque dispersam in vicem; tunc
          partem ejus oppositam ei, quod cujusque ens est, esse ipsum revera
          non ens asseruimus</span></span>).</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That which is
          generally received as positive, which we call the real, and the
          negation of which the concept nothing in its most general
          significance expresses, is just the world as idea, which I have
          shown to be the objectivity and mirror of the will. Moreover, we
          ourselves are just this will and this world, and to them belongs
          the idea in general, as one aspect of them. The form of the idea is
          space and time, therefore for this point of view all that is real
          must be in some place and at some time. Denial, abolition,
          conversion of the will, is also the abolition and the vanishing of
          the world, its mirror. If we no longer perceive it in this mirror,
          we ask in vain where it has gone, and then, because it has no
          longer any where and when, complain that it has vanished into
          nothing.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A reversed point
          of view, if it were possible for us, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page530">[pg 530]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg530"></a> would reverse the signs and show the real for
          us as nothing, and that nothing as the real. But as long as we
          ourselves are the will to live, this last—nothing as the real—can
          only be known and signified by us negatively, because the old
          saying of Empedocles, that like can only be known by like, deprives
          us here of all knowledge, as, conversely, upon it finally rests the
          possibility of all our actual knowledge, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          the world as idea; for the world is the self-knowledge of the
          will.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If, however, it
          should be absolutely insisted upon that in some way or other a
          positive knowledge should be attained of that which philosophy can
          only express negatively as the denial of the will, there would be
          nothing for it but to refer to that state which all those who have
          attained to complete denial of the will have experienced, and which
          has been variously denoted by the names ecstasy, rapture,
          illumination, union with God, and so forth; a state, however, which
          cannot properly be called knowledge, because it has not the form of
          subject and object, and is, moreover, only attainable in one's own
          experience and cannot be further communicated.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We, however, who
          consistently occupy the standpoint of philosophy, must be satisfied
          here with negative knowledge, content to have reached the utmost
          limit of the positive. We have recognised the inmost nature of the
          world as will, and all its phenomena as only the objectivity of
          will; and we have followed this objectivity from the unconscious
          working of obscure forces of Nature up to the completely conscious
          action of man. Therefore we shall by no means evade the
          consequence, that with the free denial, the surrender of the will,
          all those phenomena are also abolished; that constant strain and
          effort without end and without rest at all the grades of
          objectivity, in which and through which the world consists; the
          multifarious forms succeeding each other in gradation; the whole
          manifestation of the will; and, finally, also the universal forms
          of this manifestation, time and space, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page531">[pg 531]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg531"></a> also its last fundamental form, subject and
          object; all are abolished. No will: no idea, no world.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before us there
          is certainly only nothingness. But that which resists this passing
          into nothing, our nature, is indeed just the will to live, which we
          ourselves are as it is our world. That we abhor annihilation so
          greatly, is simply another expression of the fact that we so
          strenuously will life, and are nothing but this will, and know
          nothing besides it. But if we turn our glance from our own needy
          and embarrassed condition to those who have overcome the world, in
          whom the will, having attained to perfect self-knowledge, found
          itself again in all, and then freely denied itself, and who then
          merely wait to see the last trace of it vanish with the body which
          it animates; then, instead of the restless striving and effort,
          instead of the constant transition from wish to fruition, and from
          joy to sorrow, instead of the never-satisfied and never-dying hope
          which constitutes the life of the man who wills, we shall see that
          peace which is above all reason, that perfect calm of the spirit,
          that deep rest, that inviolable confidence and serenity, the mere
          reflection of which in the countenance, as Raphael and Correggio
          have represented it, is an entire and certain gospel; only
          knowledge remains, the will has vanished. We look with deep and
          painful longing upon this state, beside which the misery and
          wretchedness of our own is brought out clearly by the contrast. Yet
          this is the only consideration which can afford us lasting
          consolation, when, on the one hand, we have recognised incurable
          suffering and endless misery as essential to the manifestation of
          will, the world; and, on the other hand, see the world pass away
          with the abolition of will, and retain before us only empty
          nothingness. Thus, in this way, by contemplation of the life and
          conduct of saints, whom it is certainly rarely granted us to meet
          with in our own experience, but who are brought before our eyes by
          their written history, and, with the stamp of inner truth, by
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page532">[pg 532]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg532"></a> art, we must banish
          the dark impression of that nothingness which we discern behind all
          virtue and holiness as their final goal, and which we fear as
          children fear the dark; we must not even evade it like the Indians,
          through myths and meaningless words, such as reabsorption in Brahma
          or the Nirvana of the Buddhists. Rather do we freely acknowledge
          that what remains after the entire abolition of will is for all
          those who are still full of will certainly nothing; but,
          conversely, to those in whom the will has turned and has denied
          itself, this our world, which is so real, with all its suns and
          milky-ways—is nothing.<a href="#note_92" id="noteref_92" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">92</span></span></a></p>

<dd class="tei tei-notetext">I am therefore of opinion that a
          science of physiognomy cannot, with certainty, go further than to
          lay down a few quite general rules. For example, the intellectual
          qualities are to be read in the forehead and the eyes; the moral
          qualities, the expression of will, in the mouth and lower part of
          the face. The forehead and the eyes interpret each other; either of
          them seen alone can only be half understood. Genius is never
          without a high, broad, finely-arched brow; but such a brow often
          occurs where there is no genius. A clever-looking person may the
          more certainly be judged to be so the uglier the face is; and a
          stupid-looking person may the more certainly be judged to be stupid
          the more beautiful the face is; for beauty, as the approximation to
          the type of humanity, carries in and for itself the expression of
          mental clearness; the opposite is the case with ugliness, and so
          forth.</dd>

          certainty and decision from the immediate, perceptive apprehension

          without reference to this knowledge. He only arrives at the

          lecture upon Egyptian Archæology delivered by Mr. Pettigrew at the
          Literary and Scientific Institute of London, he showed some corns
          of wheat which Sir G. Wilkinson had found in a grave at Thebes, in
          which they must have lain for three thousand years. They were found
          in an hermetically sealed vase. Mr. Pettigrew had sowed twelve
          grains, and obtained a plant which grew five feet high, and the
          seeds of which were now quite ripe.—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Times</span></span>,
          21st September 1840. In the same way in 1830 Mr. Haulton produced
          in the Medical Botanical Society of London a bulbous root which was
          found in the hand of an Egyptian mummy, in which it was probably
          put in observance of some religious rite, and which must have been
          at least two thousand years old. He had planted it in a flower-pot,
          in which it grew up and flourished. This is quoted from the Medical
          Journal of 1830 in the Journal of the Royal Institute of Great
          Britain, October 1830, p. 196.—<span class="tei tei-q">“In the
          garden of Mr. Grimstone of the Herbarium, Highgate, London, is a

            Therefore these works of the mediocre poets draw it away and hold

<dd class="tei tei-notetext">Observe, in passing, that what gives
          every positive system of religion its great strength, the point of
          contact through which it takes possession of the soul, is entirely
          its ethical side. Not, however, the ethical side directly as such,
          but as it appears firmly united and interwoven with the element of
          mythical dogma which is present in every system of religion, and as
          intelligible only by means of this. So much is this the case, that
          although the ethical significance of action cannot be explained in
          accordance with the principle of sufficient reason, yet since every
          mythus follows this principle, believers regard the ethical
          significance of action as quite inseparable, and indeed as
          absolutely identical, and regard every attack upon the mythus as an
          attack upon right and virtue. This goes so far that among
          monotheistic nations atheism or godlessness has become synonymous
          with the absence of all morality. To the priests such confusions of
          conceptions are welcome, and only in consequence of them could that
          horrible monstrosity fanaticism arise and govern, not merely single
          individuals who happen to be specially perverse and bad, but whole
          nations, and finally embody itself in the Western world as the
          Inquisition (to the honour of mankind be it said that this only
          happened once in their history), which, according to the latest and
          most authentic accounts, in Madrid alone (in the rest of Spain
          there were many more such ecclesiastical dens of murderers) in 300
          years put 300,000 human beings to a painful death at the stake on
          theological grounds—a fact of which every zealot ought to be
          reminded whenever he begins to make himself heard.</dd>
<dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a href="#noteref_80" id="note_80" class="pginternal">80.</a></dt>
<dd class="tei tei-notetext">The Church would say that these are
          merely <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">opera operata</span></span>,
          which do not avail unless grace gives the faith which leads to the
          new birth. But of this farther on.</dd>
<dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a href="#noteref_81" id="note_81" class="pginternal">81.</a></dt>
<dd class="tei tei-notetext">The right of man over the life and
          powers of the brutes rests on the fact that, because with the
          growing clearness of consciousness suffering increases in like
          measure; the pain which the brute suffers through death or work is
          not so great as man would suffer by merely denying himself the
          flesh, or the powers of the brutes. Therefore man may carry the
          assertion of his existence to the extent of denying the existence
          of the brute, and the will to live as a whole endures less
          suffering in this way than if the opposite course were adopted.
          This at once determines the extent of the use man may make of the
          powers of the brutes without wrong; a limit, however, which is
          often transgressed, especially in the case of beasts of burden and
          dogs used in the chase; to which the activity of societies for the
          prevention of cruelty to animals is principally devoted. In my
          opinion, that right does not extend to vivisection, particularly of
          the higher animals. On the other hand, the insect does not suffer
          so much through its death as a man suffers from its sting. The
          Hindus do not understand this.</dd>

<dd class="tei tei-notetext">How truly this is the case may be seen
          from the fact that all the contradictions and inconceivabilities
          contained in the Christian dogmatics, consistently systematised by
          Augustine, which have led to the Pelagian insipidity which is
          opposed to them, vanish as soon as we abstract from the fundamental
          Jewish dogma, and recognize that man is not the work of another,
          but of his own will. Then all is at once clear and correct: then
          there is no need of freedom in the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">operari</span></span>, for it lies in the
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">esse</span></span>; and there also lies the
          sin as original sin. The work of grace is, however, our own. To the
          rationalistic point of view of the day, on the contrary, many
          doctrines of the Augustinian dogmatics, founded on the New
          Testament, appear quite untenable, and indeed revolting; for
          example, predestination. Accordingly Christianity proper is
          rejected, and a return is made to crude Judaism. But the
          miscalculation or the original weakness of Christian dogmatics
          lies—where it is never sought—precisely in that which is withdrawn
          from all investigation as established and certain. Take this away
          and the whole of dogmatics is rational; for this dogma destroys
          theology as it does all other sciences. If any one studies the
          Augustinian theology in the books <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De Civitate Dei</span></span>”</span>
          (especially in the Fourteenth Book), he experiences something
          analogous to the feeling of one who tries to make a body stand
          whose centre of gravity falls outside it; however he may turn it
          and place it, it always tumbles over again. So here, in spite of
          all the efforts and sophisms of Augustine, the guilt and misery of
          the world always falls back on God, who made everything and
          everything that is in everything, and also knew how all things
          would go. That Augustine himself was conscious of the difficulty,
          and puzzled by it, I have already shown in my prize-essay on the
          Freedom of the Will (ch. iv. pp. 66-68 of the first and second
          editions). In the same way, the contradiction between the goodness
          of God and the misery of the world, and also between the freedom of
          the will and the foreknowledge of God, is the inexhaustible theme
          of a controversy which lasted nearly a hundred years between the
          Cartesians, Malebranche, Leibnitz, Bayle, Clarke, Arnauld, and many
          others. The only dogma which was regarded as fixed by all parties
          was the existence and attributes of God, and they all unceasingly
          move in a circle, because they seek to bring these things into
          harmony, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, to solve a sum that will
          not come right, but always shows a remainder at some new place
          whenever we have concealed it elsewhere. But it does not occur to
          any one to seek for the source of the difficulty in the fundamental
          assumption, although it palpably obtrudes itself. Bayle alone shows
          that he saw this.</dd>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
</div><div class="secthead">

</div><div class="secthead">
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
