          without intervention of the idea, such as reproduction, the
          development and maintenance of the organism, the healing of wounds,
          the restoration or vicarious supplementing of mutilated parts, the
          salutary crisis in diseases, the works of the mechanical skill of
          animals, and the performances of instinct would not be done so
          infinitely better and more perfectly than what takes place with the
          assistance of intellect, all conscious and intentional achievements
          of men, which compared with the former are mere bungling. In
          general <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nature</span></em> signifies that which
          operates, acts, performs without the assistance of the intellect.
          Now, that this is really identical with what we find in ourselves
          as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em> is the general theme of this
          second book, and also of the essay, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ueber den Willen in der
          Natur</span></span>.”</span> The possibility of this fundamental
          knowledge depends upon the fact that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in us</span></em>
          the will is directly lighted by the intellect, which here appears
          as self-consciousness; otherwise we could just as little arrive at
          a fuller knowledge of it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">within us</span></em> as without us, and must
          for ever stop at inscrutable forces of nature. We have to
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page002">[pg 002]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg002"></a> abstract from the
          assistance of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intellect</span></em> if we wish to comprehend
          the nature of the will in itself, and thereby, as far as is
          possible, penetrate to the inner being of nature.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On this account,
          it may be remarked in passing, my direct antipode among
          philosophers is Anaxagoras; for he assumed arbitrarily as that
          which is first and original, from which everything proceeds, a
          νους, an intelligence, a subject of ideas, and he is regarded as
          the first who promulgated such a view. According to him the world
          existed earlier in the mere idea than in itself; while according to
          me it is the unconscious <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em> which constitutes the reality
          of things, and its development must have advanced very far before
          it finally attains, in the animal consciousness, to the idea and
          intelligence; so that, according to me, thought appears as the very
          last. However, according to the testimony of Aristotle
          (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Metaph.</span></span>, i. 4), Anaxagoras
          himself did not know how to begin much with his νους, but merely
          set it up, and then left it standing like a painted saint at the
          entrance, without making use of it in his development of nature,
          except in cases of need, when he did not know how else to help
          himself. All physico-theology is a carrying out of the error
          opposed to the truth expressed at the beginning of this chapter—the
          error that the most perfect form of the origin of things is that
          which is brought about by means of an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intellect</span></em>. Therefore it draws a
          bolt against all deep exploration of nature.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From the time of
          Socrates down to our own time, we find that the chief subject of
          the ceaseless disputations of the philosophers has been that
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ens rationis</span></span>, called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">soul</span></em>.
          We see the most of them assert its immortality, that is to say, its
          metaphysical nature; yet others, supported by facts which
          incontrovertibly prove the entire dependence of the intellect upon
          the bodily organism, unweariedly maintain the contrary. That soul
          is by all and before everything taken as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">absolutely
          simple</span></em>; for precisely from this its metaphysical
          nature, its immateriality and immortality <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page003">[pg 003]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg003"></a> were proved, although these by no means
          necessarily follow from it. For although we can only conceive the
          destruction of a formed body through breaking up of it into its
          parts, it does not follow from this that the destruction of a
          simple existence, of which besides we have no conception, may not
          be possible in some other way, perhaps by gradually vanishing. I,
          on the contrary, start by doing away with the presupposed
          simplicity of our subjectively conscious nature, or the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ego</span></em>,
          inasmuch as I show that the manifestations from which it was
          deduced have two very different sources, and that in any case the
          intellect is physically conditioned, the function of a material
          organ, therefore dependent upon it, and without it is just as
          impossible as the grasp without the hand; that accordingly it
          belongs to the mere phenomenon, and thus shares the fate of
          this,—that the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em>, on the contrary, is bound to
          no special organ, but is everywhere present, is everywhere that
          which moves and forms, and therefore is that which conditions the
          whole organism; that, in fact, it constitutes the metaphysical
          substratum of the whole phenomenon, consequently is not, like the
          intellect, a <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Posterius</span></span> of
          it, but its <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Prius</span></span>; and the
          phenomenon depends upon it, not it upon the phenomenon. But the
          body is reduced indeed to a mere idea, for it is only the manner in
          which the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em> exhibits itself in the
          perception of the intellect or brain. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em>,
          again, which in all other systems, different as they are in other
          respects, appears as one of the last results, is with me the very
          first. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intellect</span></em>, as mere function of the
          brain, is involved in the destruction of the body, but the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em> is by no means so. From this
          heterogeneity of the two, together with the subordinate nature of
          the intellect, it becomes conceivable that man, in the depths of
          his self-consciousness, feels himself to be eternal and
          indestructible, but yet can have no memory, either <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a parte ante</span></span> or <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a parte post</span></span>, beyond the
          duration of his life. I do not wish to anticipate here the
          exposition of the true indestructibility of our nature, which has
          its place in the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page004">[pg
          004]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg004"></a>
          fourth book, but have only sought to indicate the place where it
          links itself on.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But now that, in
          an expression which is certainly one-sided, yet from our standpoint
          true, the body is called a mere idea depends upon the fact than an
          existence in space, as something extended, and in time, as
          something that changes, and more closely determined in both through
          the causal-nexus, is only possible in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">idea</span></em>,
          for all those determinations rest upon its forms, thus in a brain,
          in which accordingly such an existence appears as something
          objective, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, foreign; therefore even
          our own body can have this kind of existence only in a brain. For
          the knowledge which I have of my body as extended, space-occupying,
          and movable, is only <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">indirect</span></em>: it is a picture in my
          brain which is brought about by means of the senses and
          understanding. The body is given to me <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">directly</span></em> only in muscular action
          and in pain and pleasure, both of which primarily and directly
          belong to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em>. But the combination of these
          two different kinds of knowledge of my own body afterwards affords
          the further insight that all other things which also have the
          objective existence described, which is primarily only in my brain,
          are not therefore entirely non-existent apart from it, but must
          also ultimately <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in themselves</span></em> be that which makes
          itself known in self-consciousness as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em>.</p>

<span style="font-size: 144%">Objective View of the
          Intellect.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are two
          fundamentally different ways of regarding the intellect, which
          depend upon the difference of the point of view, and, much as they
          are opposed to each other in consequence of this, must yet be
          brought into agreement. One is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">subjective</span></em>, which, starting from
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">within</span></em> and taking the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">consciousness</span></em> as the given, shows
          us by what mechanism the world exhibits itself in it, and how, out
          of the materials which the senses and the understanding provide, it
          constructs itself in it. We must look upon Locke as the originator
          of this method of consideration; Kant brought it to incomparably
          higher perfection; and our first book also, together with its
          supplements, are devoted to it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The method of
          considering the intellect which is opposed to this is the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">objective</span></em>, which starts from
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">without</span></em>, takes as its object not
          our own consciousness, but the beings given in outward experience,
          conscious of themselves and of the world, and now investigates the
          relation of their intellect to their other qualities, how it has
          become possible, how it has become necessary, and what it
          accomplishes for them. The standpoint of this method of
          consideration is the empirical. It takes the world and the animal
          existences present in it as absolutely given, in that it starts
          from them. It is accordingly primarily zoological, anatomical,
          physiological, and only becomes philosophical by connection with
          that first method of consideration, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page006">[pg 006]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg006"></a> from the higher point of view thereby
          attained. The only foundations of this which as yet have been given
          we owe to zootomists and physiologists, for the most part French.
          Here Cabanis is specially to be named, whose excellent work,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Des rapports du physique au
          moral</span></span>,”</span> is initiatory of this method of
          consideration on the path of physiology. The famous Bichat was his
          contemporary, but his theme was a much more comprehensive one. Even
          Gall may be named here, although his chief aim was missed.
          Ignorance and prejudice have raised against this method of
          consideration the accusation of materialism, because, adhering
          simply to experience, it does not know the immaterial substance,
          soul. The most recent advances in the physiology of the nervous
          system, through Sir Charles Bell, Magendie, Marshall Hall, and
          others, have also enriched and corrected the material of this
          method of consideration. A philosophy which, like the Kantian,
          entirely ignores this point of view for the intellect is one-sided,
          and consequently inadequate. It leaves an impassable gulf between
          our philosophical and our physiological knowledge, with which we
          can never find satisfaction.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Although what I
          have said in the two preceding chapters concerning the life and the
          activity of the brain belongs to this method of consideration, and
          in the same way all the discussions to be found under the heading,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pflanzenphysiologie</span></span>,”</span> in
          the essay, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ueber den Willen in
          der Natur</span></span>,”</span> and also a portion of those under
          the heading <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vergleichende
          Anatomie</span></span>,”</span> are devoted to it, the following
          exposition of its results in general will be by no means
          superfluous.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We become most
          vividly conscious of the glaring contrast between the two methods
          of considering the intellect opposed to each other above if we
          carry the matter to the extreme and realise that what the one, as
          reflective thought and vivid perception, directly assumes and makes
          its material is for the other nothing more than the physiological
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page007">[pg 007]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg007"></a> function of an
          internal organ, the brain; nay, that we are justified in asserting
          that the whole objective world, so boundless in space, so infinite
          in time, so unsearchable in its perfection, is really only a
          certain movement or affection of the pulpy matter in the skull. We
          then ask in astonishment: what is this brain whose function
          produces such a phenomenon of all phenomena? What is the matter
          which can be refined and potentiated to such a pulp that the
          stimulation of a few of its particles becomes the conditional
          supporter of the existence of an objective world? The fear of such
          questions led to the hypothesis of the simple substance of an
          immaterial soul, which merely dwelt in the brain. We say boldly:
          this pulp also, like every vegetable or animal part, is an organic
          structure, like all its poorer relations in the inferior
          accommodation of the heads of our irrational brethren, down to the
          lowest, which scarcely apprehends at all; yet that organic pulp is
          the last product of nature, which presupposes all the rest. But in
          itself, and outside the idea, the brain also, like everything else,
          is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em>. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">For existing for
          another is being perceived; being in itself is willing</span></em>:
          upon this it depends that on the purely objective path we never
          attain to the inner nature of things; but if we attempt to find
          their inner nature from without and empirically, this inner always
          becomes an outer again in our hands,—the pith of the tree, as well
          as its bark; the heart of the animal, as well as its hide; the
          white and the yolk of an egg, as well as its shell. On the other
          hand, upon the subjective path the inner is accessible to us at
          every moment; for we find it as the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em>
          primarily in ourselves, and must, by the clue of the analogy with
          our own nature, be able to solve that of others, in that we attain
          to the insight that a being in itself independent of being known,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, of exhibiting itself in an
          intellect, is only conceivable as willing.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If now, in the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">objective</span></em> comprehension of the
          intellect, we go back as far as we possibly can, we shall find that
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page008">[pg 008]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg008"></a> the necessity or the
          need of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">knowledge in general</span></em> arises from
          the multiplicity and the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">separate</span></em> existence of beings, thus
          from individuation. For suppose there only existed <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          single</span></em> being, such a being would have no need of
          knowledge: because nothing would exist which was different from it,
          and whose existence it would therefore have to take up into itself
          indirectly through knowledge, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, image and concept. It
          would <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">itself</span></em> already be all in all, and
          therefore there would remain nothing for it to know, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          nothing foreign that could be apprehended as object. In the case of
          a multiplicity of beings, on the other hand, every individual finds
          itself in a condition of isolation from all the rest, and hence
          arises the necessity of knowledge. The nervous system, by means of
          which the animal individual primarily becomes conscious of itself,
          is bounded by a skin; yet in the brain that has attained to
          intellect it passes beyond this limit by means of its form of
          knowledge, causality, and thus there arises for it perception as a
          consciousness of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">other</span></em> things, as an image of
          beings in space and time, which change in accordance with
          causality. In this sense it would be more correct to say,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Only the different is known by the
          different,”</span> than as Empedocles said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Only the like is known by the like,”</span> which was
          a very indefinite and ambiguous proposition; although points of
          view may certainly also be conceived from which it is true; as, for
          instance, we may observe in passing that of Helvetius when he says
          so beautifully and happily: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">Il n'y a que l'esprit qui sente l'esprit:
          c'est une corde qui ne frémit qu'à l'unison</span></span>,”</span>
          which corresponds with Xenophon's <span class="tei tei-q">“σοφον
          ειναι δει τον επιγνωσομενον τον σοφον”</span> (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">sapientem esse opportet eum, qui sapientem
          agniturus sit</span></span>), and is a great sorrow. But now,
          again, from the other side we know that multiplicity of similars
          only becomes possible through time and space; thus through the
          forms of our knowledge. Space first arises in that the knowing
          subject sees externally; it is the manner in which the subject
          comprehends something as <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page009">[pg
          009]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg009"></a>
          different from itself. But we also saw knowledge in general
          conditioned by multiplicity and difference. Thus knowledge and
          multiplicity, or individuation, stand and fall together, for they
          reciprocally condition each other. Hence it must be inferred that,
          beyond the phenomenon in the true being of all things, to which
          time and space, and consequently also multiplicity, must be
          foreign, there can also be no knowledge. Buddhism defines this as
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Pratschna Paramita</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          that which is beyond all knowledge (J. J. Schmidt, <span class="tei tei-q">“On the Maha-Jana and Pratschna Paramita”</span>). A
          <span class="tei tei-q">“knowledge of things in themselves,”</span>
          in the strictest sense of the word, would accordingly be already
          impossible from the fact that where the thing in itself begins
          knowledge ceases, and all knowledge is essentially concerned only
          with phenomena. For it springs from a limitation, by which it is
          made necessary, in order to extend the limits.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For the
          objective consideration the brain is the efflorescence of the
          organism; therefore only where the latter has attained its highest
          perfection and complexity does the brain appear in its greatest
          development. But in the preceding chapter we have recognised the
          organism as the objectification of the will; therefore the brain
          also, as a part of it, must belong to this objectification.
          Further, from the fact that the organism is only the visibility of
          the will, thus in itself is the will, I have deduced that every
          affection of the organism at once and directly affects the will,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, is felt as agreeable or
          painful. Yet, with the heightening of sensibility, in the higher
          development of the nervous system, the possibility arises that in
          the nobler, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">objective</span></em>, organs of sense (sight
          and hearing) the exquisitely delicate affections proper to them are
          perceived without in themselves and directly affecting the will,
          that is, without being either painful or agreeable, and that
          therefore they appear in consciousness as indifferent, merely
          perceived, sensations. But in the brain this heightening of
          sensibility reaches such a high degree that upon <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page010">[pg 010]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg010"></a> received impressions of sense a
          reaction even takes place, which does not proceed directly from the
          will, but is primarily a spontaneity of the function of
          understanding, which makes the transition from the directly
          perceived sensation of the senses to its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cause</span></em>;
          and since the brain then at once produces the form of space, there
          thus arises the perception of an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">external
          object</span></em>. We may therefore regard the point at which the
          understanding makes the transition from the mere sensation upon the
          retina, which is still a mere affection of the body and therefore
          of the will, to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cause</span></em> of that sensation, which it
          projects by means of its form of space, as something external and
          different from its own body, as the boundary between the world as
          will and the world as idea, or as the birthplace of the latter. In
          man, however, the spontaneity of the activity of the brain, which
          in the last instance is certainly conferred by the will, goes
          further than mere <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">perception</span></em> and immediate
          comprehension of causal relations. It extends to the construction
          of abstract conceptions out of these perceptions, and to operating
          with these conceptions, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thinking</span></em>, as that in which his
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">reason</span></em> consists. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Thoughts</span></em> are therefore furthest
          removed from the affections of the body, which, since the body is
          the objectification of the will, may, through increased intensity,
          pass at once into pain, even in the organs of sense. Accordingly
          idea and thought may also be regarded as the efflorescence of the
          will, because they spring from the highest perfection and
          development of the organism; but the organism, in itself and apart
          from the idea, is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em>. Of course, in my
          explanation, the existence of the body presupposes the world of
          idea; inasmuch as it also, as body or real object, is only in this
          world; and, on the other hand, the idea itself just as much
          presupposes the body, for it arises only through the function of an
          organ of the body. That which lies at the foundation of the whole
          phenomenon, that in it which alone has being in itself and is
          original, is exclusively the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em>; for it is the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page011">[pg 011]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg011"></a> will which through this very process
          assumes the form of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">idea</span></em>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          enters the secondary existence of an objective world, or the sphere
          of the knowable. Philosophers before Kant, with few exceptions,
          approached the explanation of the origin of our knowledge from the
          wrong side. They set out from a so-called soul, an existence whose
          inner nature and peculiar function consisted in thinking, and
          indeed quite specially in abstract thinking, with mere conceptions,
          which belonged to it the more completely the further they lay from
          all perception. (I beg to refer here to the note at the end of § 6
          of my prize essay on the foundation of morals.) This soul has in
          some inconceivable manner entered the body, and there it is only
          disturbed in its pure thinking, first by impressions of the senses
          and perceptions, still more by the desires which these excite, and
          finally by the emotions, nay, passions, to which these desires
          develop; while the characteristic and original element of this soul
          is mere abstract thinking, and given up to this it has only
          universals, inborn conceptions, and <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">æternæ veritates</span></span> for its
          objects, and leaves everything perceptible lying far below it.
          Hence, also, arises the contempt with which even now <span class="tei tei-q">“sensibility”</span> and the "sensuous" are referred to
          by professors of philosophy, nay, are even made the chief source of
          immorality, while it is just the senses which are the genuine and
          innocent source of all our knowledge, from which all thinking must
          first borrow its material, for in combination with the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span> functions of the
          intellect they produce the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">perception</span></em>. One might really
          suppose that in speaking of sensibility these gentlemen always
          think only of the pretended sixth sense of the French. Thus, as we
          have said, in the process of knowledge, its ultimate product was
          made that which is first and original in it, and accordingly the
          matter was taken hold of by the wrong end. According to my
          exposition, the intellect springs from the organism, and thereby
          from the will, and hence could not be without the latter. Thus,
          without the will it would also <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page012">[pg 012]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg012"></a> find no material to occupy it; for everything
          that is knowable is just the objectification of the will.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But not only the
          perception of the external world, or the consciousness of other
          things, is conditioned by the brain and its functions, but also
          self-consciousness. The will in itself is without consciousness,
          and remains so in the greater part of its phenomena. The secondary
          world of idea must be added, in order that it may become conscious
          of itself, just as light only becomes visible through the bodies
          which reflect it, and without them loses itself in darkness without
          producing any effect. Because the will, with the aim of
          comprehending its relations to the external world, produces a brain
          in the animal individual, the consciousness of its own self arises
          in it, by means of the subject of knowledge, which comprehends
          things as existing and the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ego</span></em> as willing. The sensibility,
          which reaches its highest degree in the brain, but is yet dispersed
          through its different parts, must first of all collect all the rays
          of its activity, concentrate them, as it were, in a focus, which,
          however, does not lie without, as in the case of the concave
          mirror, but within, as in the convex mirror. With this point now it
          first describes the line of time, upon which, therefore, all that
          it presents to itself as idea must exhibit itself, and which is the
          first and most essential form of all knowledge, or the form of
          inner sense. This focus of the whole activity of the brain is what
          Kant called the synthetic unity of apperception (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">cf.</span></span>
          vol. ii. p. 475). Only by means of this does the will become
          conscious of itself, because this focus of the activity of the
          brain, or that which knows, apprehends itself as identical with its
          own basis, from which it springs, that which wills; and thus the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ego</span></em> arises. Yet this focus of the
          brain activity remains primarily a mere subject of knowledge, and
          as such capable of being the cold and impartial spectator, the mere
          guide and counsellor of the will, and also of comprehending the
          external world in a purely objective manner, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page013">[pg 013]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg013"></a> without reference to the will and its
          weal or woe. But whenever it turns within, it recognises the will
          as the basis of its own phenomenon, and therefore combines with it
          in the consciousness of an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ego</span></em>. That focus of the activity of
          the brain (or the subject of knowledge) is indeed, as an
          indivisible point, simple, but yet is not on this account a
          substance (soul), but a mere condition or state. That of which it
          is itself a condition or state can only be known by it indirectly,
          as it were through reflection. But the ceasing of this state must
          not be regarded as the annihilation of that of which it is a state.
          This <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">knowing</span></em> and conscious <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ego</span></em> is
          related to the will, which is the basis of its phenomenal
          appearance, as the picture in the focus of a concave mirror is
          related to the mirror itself, and has, like that picture, only a
          conditioned, nay, really a merely apparent, reality. Far from being
          the absolutely first (as, for example, Fichte teaches), it is at
          bottom tertiary, for it presupposes the organism, and the organism
          presupposes the will. I admit that all that is said here is really
          only an image and a figure, and in part also hypothetical; but we
          stand at a point to which thought can scarcely reach, not to speak
          of proof. I therefore request the reader to compare with this what
          I have adduced at length on this subject in chapter 20.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now, although
          the true being of everything that exists consists in its will, and
          knowledge together with consciousness are only added at the higher
          grades of the phenomenon as something secondary, yet we find that
          the difference which the presence and the different degree of
          consciousness places between one being and another is exceedingly
          great and of important results. The subjective existence of the
          plant we must think of as a weak analogue, a mere shadow of comfort
          and discomfort; and even in this exceedingly weak degree the plant
          knows only of itself, not of anything outside of it. On the other
          hand, even the lowest animal standing next to it is forced by
          increased and more definitely specified wants to extend
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page014">[pg 014]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg014"></a> the sphere of its
          existence beyond the limits of its own body. This takes place
          through knowledge. It has a dim apprehension of its immediate
          surroundings, out of which the motives for its action with a view
          to its own maintenance arise. Thus accordingly the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">medium of
          motives</span></em> appears, and this is—the world existing
          objectively in time and space, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the world as
          idea</span></em>, however weak, obscure, and dimly dawning this
          first and lowest example of it may be. But it imprints itself ever
          more and more distinctly, ever wider and deeper, in proportion as
          in the ascending scale of animal organisations the brain is ever
          more perfectly produced. This progress in the development of the
          brain, thus of the intellect, and of the clearness of the idea, at
          each of these ever higher grades is, however, brought about by the
          constantly increasing and more complicated <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">wants</span></em>
          of this phenomenon of the will. This must always first afford the
          occasion for it, for without necessity nature (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          the will which objectifies itself in it) produces nothing, least of
          all the hardest of its productions—a more perfect brain: in
          consequence of its <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">lex
          parsimoniæ</span></span>: <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">natura nihil agit
          frustra et nihil facit supervacaneum</span></span>. It has provided
          every animal with the organs which are necessary for its sustenance
          and the weapons necessary for its conflict, as I have shown at
          length in my work, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ueber den Willen in
          der Natur</span></span>,”</span> under the heading, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vergleichende Anatomie</span></span>.”</span>
          According to this measure, therefore, it imparts to each the most
          important of those organs concerned with what is without, the
          brain, with its function the intellect. The more complicated,
          through higher development, its organisation became, the more
          multifarious and specially determined did its wants also become,
          and consequently the more difficult and the more dependent upon
          opportunity was the provision of what would satisfy them. Thus
          there was needed here a wider range of sight, a more accurate
          comprehension, a more correct distinction of things in the external
          world, in all their circumstances and relations. Accordingly we see
          the faculty of forming ideas, and its <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page015">[pg 015]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg015"></a> organs, brain, nerves, and special senses,
          appear ever more perfect the higher we advance in the scale of
          animals; and in proportion as the cerebral system develops, the
          external world appears ever more distinct, many-sided, and complete
          in consciousness. The comprehension of it now demands ever more
          attention, and ultimately in such a degree that sometimes its
          relation to the will must momentarily be lost sight of in order
          that it may take place more purely and correctly. Quite definitely
          this first appears in the case of man. With him alone does a
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pure
          separation of knowing and willing</span></em> take place. This is
          an important point, which I merely touch on here in order to
          indicate its position, and be able to take it up again later. But,
          like all the rest, nature takes this last step also in extending
          and perfecting the brain, and thereby in increasing the powers of
          knowledge, only in consequence of the increased needs, thus in the
          service of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em>. What this aims at and
          attains in man is indeed essentially the same, and not more than
          what is also its goal in the brutes—nourishment and propagation.
          But the requisites for the attainment of this goal became so much
          increased in number, and of so much higher quality and greater
          definiteness through the organisation of man, that a very much more
          considerable heightening of the intellect than the previous steps
          demanded was necessary, or at least was the easiest means of
          reaching the end. But since now the intellect, in accordance with
          its nature, is a tool of the most various utility, and is equally
          applicable to the most different kinds of ends, nature, true to her
          spirit of parsimony, could now meet through it alone all the
          demands of the wants which had now become so manifold. Therefore
          she sent forth man without clothing, without natural means of
          protection or weapons of attack, nay, with relatively little
          muscular power, combined with great frailty and little endurance of
          adverse influences and wants, in reliance upon that one great tool,
          in addition to which she had only to retain the hands from the next
          grade below him, the ape. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page016">[pg
          016]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg016"></a>
          But through the predominating intellect which here appears not only
          is the comprehension of motives, their multiplicity, and in general
          the horizon of the aims infinitely increased, but also the
          distinctness with which the will is conscious <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">of
          itself</span></em> is enhanced in the highest degree in consequence
          of the clearness of the whole consciousness which has been brought
          about, which is supported by the capacity for abstract knowledge,
          and now attains to complete reflectiveness. But thereby, and also
          through the vehemence of the will, which is necessarily presupposed
          as the supporter of such a heightened intellect, an intensifying of
          all the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">emotions</span></em> appears, and indeed the
          possibility of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">passions</span></em>, which, properly
          speaking, are unknown to the brute. For the vehemence of the will
          keeps pace with the advance of intelligence, because this advance
          really always springs from the increased needs and pressing demands
          of the will: besides this, however, the two reciprocally support
          each other. Thus the vehemence of the character corresponds to the
          greater energy of the beating of the heart and the circulation of
          the blood, which physically heighten the activity of the brain. On
          the other hand, the clearness of the intelligence intensifies the
          emotions, which are called forth by the outward circumstances, by
          means of the more vivid apprehension of the latter. Hence, for
          example, young calves quietly allow themselves to be packed in a
          cart and carried off; but young lions, if they are only separated
          from their mother, remain permanently restless, and roar
          unceasingly from morning to night; children in such a position
          would cry and vex themselves almost to death. The vivaciousness and
          impetuosity of the ape is in exact proportion to its greatly
          developed intellect. It depends just on this reciprocal
          relationship that man is, in general, capable of far greater
          sorrows than the brute, but also of greater joy in satisfied and
          pleasing emotions. In the same way his higher intelligence makes
          him more sensible to <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">ennui</span></span>
          than the brute; but it also becomes, if he is individually very
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page017">[pg 017]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg017"></a> complete, an
          inexhaustible source of entertainment. Thus, as a whole, the
          manifestation of the will in man is related to that in the brute of
          the higher species, as a note that has been struck to its fifth
          pitched two or three octaves lower. But between the different kinds
          of brutes also the differences of intellect, and thereby of
          consciousness, are great and endlessly graduated. The mere analogy
          of consciousness which we must yet attribute to plants will be
          related to the still far deader subjective nature of an unorganised
          body, very much as the consciousness of the lowest species of
          animals is related to the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">quasi</span></span>
          consciousness of plants. We may present to our imagination the
          innumerable gradations in the degree of consciousness under the
          figure of the different velocity of points which are unequally
          distant from the centre of a revolving sphere. But the most
          correct, and indeed, as our third book teaches, the natural figure
          of that gradation is afforded us by the scale in its whole compass
          from the lowest audible note to the highest. It is, however, the
          grade of consciousness which determines the grade of existence of a
          being. For every immediate existence is subjective: the objective
          existence is in the consciousness of another, thus only for this
          other, consequently quite indirect. Through the grade of
          consciousness beings are as different as through the will they are
          alike, for the will is what is common to them all.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But what we have
          now considered between the plant and the animal, and then between
          the different species of animals, occurs also between man and man.
          Here also that which is secondary, the intellect, by means of the
          clearness of consciousness and distinctness of knowledge which
          depends upon it, constitutes a fundamental and immeasurably great
          difference in the whole manner of the existence, and thereby in the
          grade of it. The higher the consciousness has risen, the more
          distinct and connected are the thoughts, the clearer the
          perceptions the more intense the sensations. Through it everything
          gains <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page018">[pg 018]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg018"></a> more depth: emotion,
          sadness, joy, and sorrow. Commonplace blockheads are not even
          capable of real joy: they live on in dull insensibility. While to
          one man his consciousness only presents his own existence, together
          with the motives which must be apprehended for the purpose of
          sustaining and enlivening it, in a bare comprehension of the
          external world, it is to another a <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">camera obscura</span></span> in which the
          macrocosm exhibits itself:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The difference
          of the whole manner of existence which the extremes of the
          gradation of intellectual capacity establish between man and man is
          so great that that between a king and a day labourer seems small in
          comparison. And here also, as in the case of the species of
          animals, a connection between the vehemence of the will and the
          height of the intellect can be shown. Genius is conditioned by a
          passionate temperament, and a phlegmatic genius is inconceivable:
          it seems as if an exceptionally vehement, thus a violently longing,
          will must be present if nature is to give an abnormally heightened
          intellect, as corresponding to it; while the merely physical
          account of this points to the greater energy with which the
          arteries of the head move the brain and increase its turgescence.
          Certainly, however, the quantity, quality, and form of the brain
          itself is the other and incomparably more rare condition of genius.
          On the other hand, phlegmatic persons are as a rule of very
          moderate mental power; and thus the northern, cold-blooded, and
          phlegmatic nations are in general noticeably inferior in mind to
          the southern vivacious and passionate peoples; although, as
          Bacon<a href="#note_2" id="noteref_2" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2</span></span></a> has
          most pertinently remarked, if once a man of a northern nation is
          highly gifted by nature, he can then reach a grade which no
          southern ever attains to. It is accordingly as perverse
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page019">[pg 019]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg019"></a> as it is common to
          take the great minds of different nations as the standard for
          comparing their mental powers: for that is just attempting to prove
          the rule by the exceptions. It is rather the great majority of each
          nation that one has to consider: for one swallow does not make a
          summer. We have further to remark here that that very
          passionateness which is a condition of genius, bound up with its
          vivid apprehension of things, produces in practical life, where the
          will comes into play, and especially in the case of sudden
          occurrences, so great an excitement of the emotions that it
          disturbs and confuses the intellect; while the phlegmatic man in
          such a case still retains the full use of his mental faculties,
          though they are much more limited, and then accomplishes much more
          with them than the greatest genius can achieve. Accordingly a
          passionate temperament is favourable to the original quality of the
          intellect, but a phlegmatic temperament to its use. Therefore
          genius proper is only for theoretical achievements, for which it
          can choose and await its time, which will just be the time at which
          the will is entirely at rest, and no waves disturb the clear mirror
          of the comprehension of the world. On the other hand, genius is ill
          adapted and unserviceable for practical life, and is therefore for
          the most part unfortunate. Goethe's <span class="tei tei-q">“Tasso”</span> is written from this point of view. As
          now genius proper depends upon the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">absolute</span></em> strength of the
          intellect, which must be purchased by a correspondingly excessive
          vehemence of disposition, so, on the other hand, the great
          pre-eminence in practical life that makes generals and statesmen
          depends upon the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">relative</span></em> strength of the
          intellect, thus upon the highest degree of it that can be attained
          without too great excitability of the emotions, and too great
          vehemence of character, and that therefore can hold its own even in
          the storm. Great firmness of will and constancy of mind, together
          with a capable and fine understanding, are here sufficient; and
          whatever goes beyond this acts detrimentally, for too great a
          development of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page020">[pg
          020]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg020"></a>
          the intelligence directly impedes firmness of character and
          resolution of will. Hence this kind of eminence is not so abnormal,
          and is a hundred times less rare than the former kind; and
          accordingly we see great generals and great ministers appear in
          every age, whenever the merely external conditions are favourable
          to their efficiency. Great poets and philosophers, on the other
          hand, leave centuries waiting for them; and yet humanity may be
          contented even with this rare appearance of them, for their works
          remain, and do not exist only for the present, like the
          achievements of those other men. It is also quite in keeping with
          the law of the parsimony of nature referred to above that it
          bestows great eminence of mind in general upon very few, and genius
          only as the rarest of all exceptions, while it equips the great
          mass of the human race with no more mental power than is required
          for the maintenance of the individual and the species. For the
          great, and through their very satisfaction, constantly increasing
          needs of the human race make it necessary that the great majority
          of men should pass their lives in occupations of a coarsely
          physical and entirely mechanical description. And what would be the
          use to them of an active mind, a glowing imagination, a subtle
          understanding, and a profoundly penetrating intellect? These would
          only make them useless and unhappy. Therefore nature has thus gone
          about the most costly of all her productions in the least
          extravagant manner. In order not to judge unfairly one ought also
          to settle definitely one's expectations of the mental achievements
          of men generally from this point of view, and to regard, for
          example, even learned men, since as a rule they have become so only
          by the force of outward circumstances, primarily as men whom nature
          really intended to be tillers of the soil; indeed even professors
          of philosophy ought to be estimated according to this standard, and
          then their achievements will be found to come up to all fair
          expectations. It is worth noticing that in the south, where the
          necessities of life press less <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page021">[pg 021]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg021"></a> severely upon the human race, and more
          leisure is allowed, the mental faculties even of the multitude also
          become more active and finer. It is physiologically noteworthy that
          the preponderance of the mass of the brain over that of the spinal
          cord and the nerves, which, according to Sömmerring's acute
          discovery, affords the true and closest measure of the degree of
          intelligence both of species of brutes and of individual men, at
          the same time increases the direct power of moving, the agility of
          the limbs; because, through the great inequality of the relation,
          the dependence of all motor nerves upon the brain becomes more
          decided; and besides this the cerebellum, which is the primary
          controller of movements, shares the qualitative perfection of the
          cerebrum; thus through both all voluntary movements gain greater
          facility, rapidity, and manageableness, and by the concentration of
          the starting-point of all activity that arises which Lichtenberg
          praises in Garrick: <span class="tei tei-q">“that he appeared to be
          present in all the muscles of his body.”</span> Hence clumsiness in
          the movement of the body indicates clumsiness in the movement of
          the thoughts, and will be regarded as a sign of stupidity both in
          individuals and nations, as much as sleepiness of the countenance
          and vacancy of the glance. Another symptom of the physiological
          state of the case referred to is the fact that many persons are
          obliged at once to stand still whenever their conversation with any
          one who is walking with them begins to gain some connection;
          because their brain, as soon as it has to link together a few
          thoughts, has no longer as much power over as is required to keep
          the limbs in motion by means of the motory nerves, so closely is
          everything measured with them.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It results from
          this whole objective consideration of the intellect and its origin,
          that it is designed for the comprehension of those ends upon the
          attainment of which depends the individual life and its
          propagation, but by no means for deciphering the inner nature of
          things and of the world, which exists independently of the knower.
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page022">[pg 022]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg022"></a> What to the plant is
          the susceptibility to light, in consequence of which it guides its
          growth in the direction of it, that is, in kind, the knowledge of
          the brute, nay, even of man, although in degree it is increased in
          proportion as the needs of each of these beings demand. With them
          all apprehension remains a mere consciousness of their relations to
          other things, and is by no means intended to present again in the
          consciousness of the knower the peculiar, absolutely real nature of
          these things. Rather, as springing from the will, the intellect is
          also only designed for its service, thus for the apprehension of
          motives; it is adapted for this, and is therefore of a thoroughly
          practical tendency. This also holds good if we conceive the
          significance of life as ethical; for in this regard too we find man
          knowing only for the benefit of his conduct. Such a faculty of
          knowledge, existing exclusively for practical ends, will from its
          nature always comprehend only the relations of things to each
          other, but not the inner nature of them, as it is in itself. But to
          regard the complex of these relations as the absolute nature of the
          world as it is in itself, and the manner in which it necessarily
          exhibits itself in accordance with the laws predisposed in the
          brain as the eternal laws of the existence of all things, and then
          to construct ontology, cosmology, and theology in accordance with
          this view—this was really the old fundamental error, of which
          Kant's teaching has made an end. Here, then, our objective, and
          therefore for the most part physiological consideration of the
          intellect meets <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">his</span></em> transcendental consideration
          of it; nay, appears in a certain sense even as an <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span> insight into it; for,
          from a point of view which we have taken up outside of it, our
          objective view enables us to know in its origin, and therefore as
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">necessary</span></em>, what that
          transcendental consideration, starting from facts of consciousness,
          presents only as a matter of fact. For it follows from our
          objective consideration of the intellect, that the world as idea,
          as it exists stretched out in space and time, and moves on
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page023">[pg 023]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg023"></a> regularly according
          to the strict law of causality, is primarily only a physiological
          phenomenon, a function of the brain, which brings it about,
          certainly upon the occasion of certain external stimuli, but yet in
          conformity with its own laws. Accordingly it is beforehand a matter
          of course, that what goes on in this function itself, and therefore
          through it and for it, must by no means be regarded as the nature
          of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">things
          in themselves</span></em>, which exist independently of it and are
          entirely different from it, but primarily exhibits only the mode or
          manner of this function itself, which can always receive only a
          very subordinate modification through that which exists completely
          independently of it, and sets it in motion as a stimulus. As, then,
          Locke claimed for the organs of sense all that comes into our
          apprehension by means of the sensation, in order to deny that it
          belongs to things in themselves, so Kant, with the same intention,
          and pursuing the same path further, has proved all that makes
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">perception</span></em> proper possible, thus
          space, time, and causality, to be functions of the brain; although
          he has refrained from using this physiological expression, to
          which, however, our present method of investigation, coming from
          the opposite side, the side of the real, necessarily leads us. Kant
          arrived upon his analytical path at the result that what we know
          are mere <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">phenomena</span></em>. What this mysterious
          expression really means becomes clear from our objective and
          genetic investigation of the intellect. The phenomena are the
          motives for the aims of individual will as they exhibit themselves
          in the intellect which the will has produced for this purpose
          (which itself appears as a phenomenon objectively, as the brain),
          and which, when comprehended, as far as one can follow their
          concatenation, afford us in their connection the world which
          extends itself objectively in time and space, and which I call the
          world as idea. Moreover, from our point of view, the objectionable
          element vanishes which in the Kantian doctrine arises from the fact
          that, because the intellect <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page024">[pg 024]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg024"></a> knows merely phenomena instead of things as
          they are in themselves, nay, in consequence of this is led astray
          into paralogisms and unfounded hypostases by means of <span class="tei tei-q">“sophistications, not of men but of the reason itself,
          from which even the wisest does not free himself, and if, perhaps
          indeed after much trouble, he avoids error, can yet never get quit
          of the illusion which unceasingly torments and mocks
          him”</span>—because of all this, I say, the appearance arises that
          our intellect is intentionally designed to lead us into errors. For
          the objective view of the intellect given here, which contains a
          genesis of it, makes it conceivable that, being exclusively
          intended for practical ends, it is merely the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">medium of
          motives</span></em>, and therefore fulfils its end by an accurate
          presentation of these, and that if we undertake to discover the
          nature of things in themselves, from the manifold phenomena which
          here exhibit themselves objectively to us, and their laws, we do
          this at our own peril and on our own responsibility. We have
          recognised that the original inner force of nature, without
          knowledge and working in the dark, which, if it has worked its way
          up to self-consciousness, reveals itself to this as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em>,
          attains to this grade only by the production of an animal brain and
          of knowledge, as its function, whereupon the phenomenon of the
          world of perception arises in this brain. But to explain this mere
          brain phenomenon, with the conformity to law which is invariably
          connected with its functions, as the objective inner nature of the
          world and the things in it, which is independent of the brain,
          existing before and after it, is clearly a spring which nothing
          warrants us in making. From this <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">mundus phœnomenon</span></span>, however, from
          this perception which arises under such a variety of conditions,
          all our conceptions are drawn. They have all their content from it,
          or even only in relation to it. Therefore, as Kant says, they are
          only for immanent, not for transcendental, use; that is to say,
          these conceptions of ours, this first material of thought, and
          consequently <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page025">[pg
          025]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg025"></a>
          still more the judgments which result from their combination, are
          unfitted for the task of thinking the nature of things in
          themselves, and the true connection of the world and existence;
          indeed, to undertake this is analogous to expressing the
          stereometrical content of a body in square inches. For our
          intellect, originally only intended to present to an individual
          will its paltry aims, comprehends accordingly mere <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">relations</span></em> of things, and does not
          penetrate to their inner being, to their real nature. It is
          therefore a merely superficial force, clings to the surface of
          things, and apprehends mere <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">species
          transitivas</span></span>, not the true being of things. From this
          it arises that we cannot understand and comprehend any single
          thing, even the simplest and smallest, through and through, but
          something remains entirely inexplicable to us in each of them. Just
          because the intellect is a product of nature, and is therefore only
          intended for its ends, the Christian mystics have very aptly called
          it <span class="tei tei-q">“the light of nature,”</span> and driven
          it back within its limits; for nature is the object to which alone
          it is the subject. The thought from which the Critique of Pure
          Reason has sprung really lies already at the foundation of this
          expression. That we cannot comprehend the world on the direct path,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, through the uncritical,
          direct application of the intellect and its data, but when we
          reflect upon it become ever more deeply involved in insoluble
          mysteries, points to the fact that the intellect, thus knowledge
          itself, is secondary, a mere product, brought about by the
          development of the inner being of the world, which consequently
          till then preceded it, and it at last appeared as a breaking
          through to the light out of the obscure depths of the unconscious
          striving the nature of which exhibits itself as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em> to
          the self-consciousness which now at once arises. That which
          preceded knowledge as its condition, whereby it first became
          possible, thus its own basis, cannot be directly comprehended by
          it; as the eye cannot see itself. It is rather the relations of one
          existence to another, exhibiting themselves <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page026">[pg 026]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg026"></a> upon the surface of things, which alone
          are its affair, and are so only by means of the apparatus of the
          intellect, its forms, space, time, and causality. Just because the
          world has made itself without the assistance of knowledge, its
          whole being does not enter into knowledge, but knowledge
          presupposes the existence of the world; on which account the origin
          of the world does not lie within its sphere. It is accordingly
          limited to the relations between the things which lie before it,
          and is thus sufficient for the individual will, for the service of
          which alone it appeared. For the intellect is, as has been shown,
          conditioned by nature, lies in it, belongs to it, and cannot
          therefore place itself over against it as something quite foreign
          to it, in order thus to take up into itself its whole nature,
          absolutely, objectively, and thoroughly. It can, if fortune favours
          it, understand all that is in nature, but not nature itself, at
          least not directly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">However
          discouraging to metaphysics this essential limitation of the
          intellect may be, which arises from its nature and origin, it has
          yet another side which is very consoling. It deprives the direct
          utterances of nature of their unconditional validity, in the
          assertion of which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">naturalism</span></em> proper consists. If,
          therefore, nature presents to us every living thing as appearing
          out of nothing, and, after an ephemeral existence, returning again
          for ever to nothing, and if it seems to take pleasure in the
          unceasing production of new beings, in order that it may be able
          unceasingly to destroy, and, on the other hand, is unable to bring
          anything permanent to light; if accordingly we are forced to
          recognise <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">matter</span></em> as that which alone is
          permanent, which never came into being and never passes away, but
          brings forth all things from its womb, whence its name appears to
          be derived from <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">mater rerum</span></span>,
          and along with it, as the father of things, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">form</span></em>,
          which, just as fleeting as matter is permanent, changes really
          every moment, and can only maintain itself so long as it clings as
          a parasite to matter (now to one part of it, now to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page027">[pg 027]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg027"></a> another), but when once it entirely
          loses hold, disappears, as is shown by the palæotheria and the
          ichthyosaurians, we must indeed recognise this as the direct and
          genuine utterance of nature, but on account of the origin of the
          intellect explained above, and the nature of it which results from
          this origin, we cannot ascribe to this utterance an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unconditional
          truth</span></em>, but rather only an entirely <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">conditional</span></em> truth, which Kant has
          appropriately indicated as such by calling it the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">phenomenon</span></em> in opposition to the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thing in
          itself</span></em>.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If, in spite of
          this essential limitation of the intellect, it is possible, by a
          circuitous route, to arrive at a certain understanding of the world
          and the nature of things, by means of reflection widely pursued,
          and the skilful combination of objective knowledge directed towards
          without, with the data of self-consciousness, this will yet be only
          a very limited, entirely indirect, and relative understanding, a
          parabolical translation into the forms of knowledge, thus a
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">quadam prodire tenus</span></span>, which must
          always leave many problems still unsolved. On the other hand, the
          fundamental error of the old <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dogmatism</span></em> in all its forms, which
          was destroyed by Kant, was this, that it started absolutely from
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">knowledge</span></em>, i.e., <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the world as
          idea</span></em>, in order to deduce and construct from its laws
          being in general, whereby it accepted that world of idea, together
          with its laws, as absolutely existing and absolutely real; while
          its whole existence is throughout relative, and a mere result or
          phenomenon of the true being which lies at its foundation,—or, in
          other words, that it constructed an ontology when it had only
          materials for a dianoiology. Kant discovered the subjectively
          conditioned and therefore entirely immanent nature of knowledge,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, its unsuitableness for
          transcendental use, from the constitution of knowledge itself; and
          therefore he very appropriately called his doctrine the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Critique
          of Reason</span></span>. He accomplished this partly by showing the
          important and thoroughly <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          priori</span></span> part of all knowledge, which, as throughout
          subjective, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page028">[pg
          028]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg028"></a>
          spoils all objectivity, and partly by professedly proving that if
          they were followed out to the end the principles of knowledge,
          taken as purely objective, led to contradictions. He had, however,
          hastily assumed that, apart from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">objective</span></em> knowledge, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          apart from the world as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">idea</span></em>, there is nothing given us
          except conscience, out of which he constructed the little that
          still remained of metaphysics, his moral theology, to which,
          however, he attributed absolutely only a practical validity, and no
          theoretical validity at all. He had overlooked that although
          certainly objective knowledge, or the world as idea, affords
          nothing but phenomena, together with their phenomenal connection
          and regressus, yet our own nature necessarily also belongs to the
          world of things in themselves, for it must have its root in it. But
          here, even if the root itself cannot be brought to light, it must
          be possible to gather some data for the explanation of the
          connection of the world of phenomena with the inner nature of
          things. Thus here lies the path upon which I have gone beyond Kant
          and the limits which he drew, yet always restricting myself to the
          ground of reflection, and consequently of honesty, and therefore
          without the vain pretension of intellectual intuition or absolute
          thought which characterises the period of pseudo-philosophy between
          Kant and me. In his proof of the insufficiency of rational
          knowledge to fathom the nature of the world Kant started from
          knowledge as a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fact</span></em>, which our consciousness
          affords us, thus in this sense he proceeded <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          posteriori</span></span>. But in this chapter, and also in my work,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ueber den Willen in der
          Natur</span></span>,”</span> I have sought to show what knowledge
          is in its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nature and origin</span></em>, something
          secondary, designed for individual ends; whence it follows that it
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">must
          be</span></em> insufficient to fathom the nature of the world. Thus
          so far I have reached the same goal <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          priori</span></span>. But one never knows anything wholly and
          completely until one has gone right round it for that purpose, and
          has got back to it from the opposite side from which one
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page029">[pg 029]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg029"></a> started. Therefore
          also, in the case of the important fundamental knowledge here
          considered, one must not merely go from the intellect to the
          knowledge of the world, as Kant has done, but also from the world,
          taken as given, to the intellect, as I have undertaken here. Then
          this physiological consideration, in the wider sense, becomes the
          supplement of that ideological, as the French say, or, more
          accurately, transcendental consideration.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the above, in
          order not to break the thread of the exposition, I have postponed
          the explanation of one point which I touched upon. It was this,
          that in proportion as, in the ascending series of animals, the
          intellect appears ever more developed and complete, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">knowledge</span></em> always separates itself
          more distinctly from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em>, and thereby becomes purer.
          What is essential upon this point will be found in my work,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ueber den Willen in der
          Natur</span></span>,”</span> under the heading, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pflanzenphysiologie</span></span>”</span> (p.
          68-72 of the second, and 74-77 of the third edition), to which I
          refer, in order to avoid repetition, and merely add here a few
          remarks. Since the plant possesses neither irritability nor
          sensibility, but the will objectifies itself in it only as plastic
          or reproductive power, it has neither muscle nor nerve. In the
          lowest grades of the animal kingdom, in zoophites, especially in
          polyps, we cannot as yet distinctly recognise the separation of
          these two constituent parts, but still we assume their existence,
          though in a state of fusion; because we perceive movements which
          follow, not, as in the case of plants, upon mere stimuli, but upon
          motives, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, in consequence of a
          certain apprehension. Now in proportion as, in the ascending series
          of animals, the nervous and muscular systems <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">separate</span></em> ever more distinctly from
          each other, till in the vertebrate animals, and most completely in
          man, the former divides into an organic and a cerebral nervous
          system, and of these the latter again develops into the excessively
          complicated apparatus of the cerebrum and cerebellum, spinal
          marrow, cerebral and spinal nerves, sensory and motor nerve
          fascicles, of which only <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page030">[pg
          030]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg030"></a>
          the cerebrum, together with the sensory nerves depending upon it,
          and the posterior spinal nerve fascicles are intended for the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">apprehension of the motive</span></em> from
          the external world, while all the other parts are intended for the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">transmission</span></em> of the motive to the
          muscles in which the will manifests itself directly; in the same
          proportion does the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">motive</span></em> separate ever more
          distinctly in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">consciousness</span></em> from the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">act of
          will</span></em> which it calls forth, thus the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">idea</span></em>
          from the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em>; and thereby the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">objectivity</span></em> of consciousness
          constantly increases, for the ideas exhibit themselves ever more
          distinctly and purely in it. These two <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">separations</span></em> are, however, really
          only one and the same, which we have here considered from two
          sides, the objective and the subjective, or first in the
          consciousness of other things and then in self-consciousness. Upon
          the degree of this separation ultimately depends the difference and
          the gradation of intellectual capacity, both between different
          kinds of animals and between individual human beings; thus it gives
          the standard for the intellectual completeness of these beings. For
          the clearness of the consciousness of the external world, the
          objectivity of the perception, depends upon it. In the passage
          referred to above I have shown that the brute only perceives things
          so far as they are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">motives</span></em> for its will, and that
          even the most intelligent of the brutes scarcely overstep these
          limits, because their intellect is too closely joined to the will
          from which it has sprung. On the other hand, even the stupidest man
          comprehends things in some degree <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">objectively</span></em>; for he recognises not
          merely what they are with reference to him, but also something of
          what they are with reference to themselves and to other things. Yet
          in the case of very few does this reach such a degree that they are
          in a position to examine and judge of anything purely <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">objectively</span></em>; but <span class="tei tei-q">“that must I do, that must I say, that must I
          believe,”</span> is the goal to which on every occasion their
          thought hastens in a direct line, and at which their understanding
          at once finds welcome rest. For thinking is as unendurable to
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page031">[pg 031]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg031"></a> the weak head as the
          lifting of a burden to the weak arm; therefore both hasten to set
          it down. The objectivity of knowledge, and primarily of perceptive
          knowledge, has innumerable grades, which depend upon the energy of
          the intellect and its separation from the will, and the highest of
          which is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">genius</span></em>, in which the comprehension
          of the external world becomes so pure and objective that to it even
          more reveals itself directly in the individual thing than the
          individual thing itself, namely, the nature of its whole <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">species</span></em>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          its Platonic Idea; which is brought about by the fact that in this
          case the will entirely vanishes from consciousness. Here is the
          point at which the present investigation, starting from
          physiological grounds, connects itself with the subject of our
          third book, the metaphysics of the beautiful, where æsthetic
          comprehension proper, which, in a high degree, is peculiar to
          genius alone, is fully considered as the condition of pure,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, perfectly will-less, and
          on that account completely objective knowledge. According to what
          has been said, the rise of intelligence, from the obscurest animal
          consciousness up to that of man, is a progressive <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">loosening of the
          intellect from the will</span></em>, which appears complete,
          although only as an exception, in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">genius</span></em>.
          Therefore genius may be defined as the highest grade of the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">objectivity</span></em> of knowledge. The
          condition of this, which so seldom occurs, is a decidedly larger
          measure of intelligence than is required for the service of the
          will, which constitutes its basis; it is accordingly this free
          surplus which first really properly comes to know the world,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, comprehends it perfectly
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">objectively</span></em>, and now paints
          pictures, composes poems, and thinks in accordance with this
          comprehension.</p>

          The Objectification Of The Will In Unconscious Nature.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That the will
          which we find within us does not proceed, as philosophy has
          hitherto assumed, first from knowledge, and indeed is a mere
          modification of it, thus something secondary, derived, and, like
          knowledge itself, conditioned by the brain; but that it is the
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">prius</span></span> of knowledge, the kernel
          of our nature, and that original force itself which forms and
          sustains the animal body, in that it carries out both its
          unconscious and its conscious functions;—this is the first step in
          the fundamental knowledge of my metaphysics. Paradoxical as it even
          now seems to many that the will in itself is without knowledge, yet
          the scholastics in some way already recognised and confessed it;
          for Jul. Cæs. Vaninus (that well-known sacrifice to fanaticism and
          priestly fury), who was thoroughly versed in their philosophy, says
          in his <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Amphitheatro</span></span>,”</span> p. 181:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Voluntas potentia
          cœca est, ex scholasticorum opinione</span></span>.”</span> That,
          further, it is that same will which in the plant forms the bud in
          order to develop the leaf and the flower out of it; nay, that the
          regular form of the crystal is only the trace which its momentary
          effort has left behind, and that in general, as the true and only
          αυτοματον, in the proper sense of the word, it lies at the
          foundation of all the forces of unorganised nature, plays, acts, in
          all their multifarious phenomena, imparts power to their laws, and
          even in the crudest mass manifests itself as gravity;—this insight
          is the second step in that fundamental knowledge, and is
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page033">[pg 033]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg033"></a> brought about by
          further reflection. But it would be the grossest misunderstanding
          to suppose that this is a mere question of a word to denote an
          unknown quantity. It is rather the most real of all real knowledge
          which is here expressed in language. For it is the tracing back of
          that which is quite inaccessible to our immediate knowledge, and
          therefore in its essence foreign and unknown to us, which we denote
          by the words <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">force of nature</span></em>, to that which is
          known to us most accurately and intimately, but which is yet only
          accessible to us in our own being and directly, and must therefore
          be carried over from this to other phenomena. It is the insight
          that what is inward and original in all the changes and movements
          of bodies, however various they may be, is in its nature identical;
          that yet we have only one opportunity of getting to know it more
          closely and directly, and that is in the movements of our own body.
          In consequence of this knowledge we must call it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em>.
          It is the insight that that which acts and strives in nature, and
          exhibits itself in ever more perfect phenomena, when it has worked
          itself up so far that the light of knowledge falls directly upon
          it, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, when it has attained to
          the state of self-consciousness—exists as that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em>,
          which is what is most intimately known to us, and therefore cannot
          be further explained by anything else, but rather affords the
          explanation of all other things. It is accordingly the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thing in
          itself</span></em> so far as this can ever be reached by knowledge.
          Consequently it is that which must express itself in some way in
          everything in the world, for it is the inner nature of the world
          and the kernel of all phenomena.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As my essay,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ueber den Willen in der
          Natur</span></span>,”</span> specially refers to the subject of
          this chapter, and also adduces the evidence of unprejudiced
          empiricists in favour of this important point of my doctrine, I
          have only to add now to what is said there a few supplementary
          remarks, which are therefore strung together in a somewhat
          fragmentary manner.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page034">[pg

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">First, then,
          with reference to plant life, I draw attention to the remarkable
          first two chapters of Aristotle's work upon plants. What is most
          interesting in them, as is so often the case with Aristotle, are
          the opinions of earlier profound philosophers quoted by him. We see
          there that Anaxagoras and Empedocles quite rightly taught that
          plants have the motion of their growth by virtue of their
          indwelling <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">desires</span></em> (επιθυμια); nay, that they
          also attributed to them pleasure and pain, therefore sensation. But
          Plato only ascribed to them desires, and that on account of their
          strong appetite for nutrition (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">cf.</span></span>
          Plato in the <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Timœus</span></span>,”</span> p. 403, Bip.)
          Aristotle, on the other hand, true to his customary method, glides
          on the surface of things, confines himself to single
          characteristics and conceptions fixed by current expressions, and
          asserts that without sensation there can be no desires, and that
          plants have not sensation. He is, however, in considerable
          embarrassment, as his confused language shows, till here also,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“where fails the comprehension, a word
          steps promptly in as deputy,”</span> namely, το θρεπτικον, the
          faculty of nourishing. Plants have this, and thus a part of the
          so-called soul, according to his favourite division into
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">anima vegetativa</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">sensitiva</span></span>, and <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">intellectiva</span></span>. This, however, is
          just a scholastic <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Quidditas</span></span>, and
          signifies <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">plantœ nutriuntur quia habent
          facultatem nutritivam</span></span>. It is therefore a bad
          substitute for the more profound research of his predecessors, whom
          he is criticising. We also see, in the second chapter, that
          Empedocles even recognised the sexuality of plants; which Aristotle
          then also finds fault with, and conceals his want of special
          knowledge behind general propositions, such as this, that plants
          could not have both sexes combined, for if so they would be more
          complete than animals. By quite an analogous procedure he displaces
          the correct astronomical system of the world of the Pythagoreans,
          and by his absurd fundamental principles, which he specially
          explains in the books <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">de Cœlo</span></span>, introduces the system
          of Ptolemy, whereby mankind was again <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page035">[pg 035]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg035"></a> deprived of an already discovered truth of
          the greatest importance for almost two thousand years.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I cannot refrain
          from giving here the saying of an excellent biologist of our own
          time who fully agrees with my teaching. It is G. R. Treviranus,
          who, in his work, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ueber die
          Erscheinungen und Gesetze des organischen
          Lebens</span></span>,”</span> 1832, Bd. 2, Abth. 1, § 49, has said
          what follows: <span class="tei tei-q">“A form of life is, however,
          conceivable in which the effect of the external upon the internal
          produces merely feelings of desire or dislike. Such is the life of
          plants. In the higher forms of animal life the external is felt as
          something objective.”</span> Treviranus speaks here from pure
          unprejudiced comprehension of nature, and is as little conscious of
          the metaphysical importance of his words as of the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">contradictio in adjecto</span></span> which
          lies in the conception of something <span class="tei tei-q">“felt
          as objective,”</span> a conception which indeed he works out at
          great length. He does not know that all feeling is essentially
          subjective, and all that is objective is, on the other hand,
          perception, and therefore a product of the understanding. Yet this
          does not detract at all from the truth and importance of what he
          says.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In fact, in the
          life of plants the truth that will can exist without knowledge is
          apparent—one might say palpably recognisable. For here we see a
          decided effort, determined by wants, modified in various ways, and
          adapting itself to the difference of the circumstances, yet clearly
          without knowledge. And just because the plant is without knowledge
          it bears its organs of generation ostentatiously in view, in
          perfect innocence; it knows nothing about it. As soon, on the other
          hand, as in the series of existences knowledge appears the organs
          of generation are transferred to a hidden part. Man, however, with
          whom this is again less the case, conceals them intentionally: he
          is ashamed of them.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Primarily, then,
          the vital force is identical with the will, but so also are all
          other forces of nature; though this is less apparent. If,
          therefore, we find the recognition <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page036">[pg 036]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg036"></a> of a desire, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          of a will, as the basis of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">plant life</span></em>, expressed at all
          times, with more or less distinctness of conception, on the other
          hand, the reference of the forces of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unorganised</span></em> nature to the same
          foundation is rarer in proportion as their remoteness from our own
          nature is greater. In fact, the boundary between the organised and
          the unorganised is the most sharply drawn in the whole of nature,
          and perhaps the only one that admits of no transgressions; so that
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">natura non facit saltus</span></span> seems to
          suffer an exception here. Although certain crystallisations display
          an external form resembling the vegetable, yet even between the
          smallest lichen, the lowest fungus, and everything unorganised
          there remains a fundamental and essential difference. In the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unorganised</span></em> body that which is
          essential and permanent, thus that upon which its identity and
          integrity rests, is the material, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">matter</span></em>;
          what is unessential and changing is, on the other hand, the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">form</span></em>. With the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">organised</span></em> body the case is exactly
          reversed; for its life, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, its existence as an
          organised being, simply consists in the constant change of the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">material</span></em>, while the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">form</span></em>
          remains permanent. Its being and its identity thus lies in the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">form</span></em> alone. Therefore the
          continuance of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unorganised</span></em> body depends upon
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">repose</span></em> and exclusion from external
          influences: thus alone does it retain its existence; and if this
          condition is perfect, such a body lasts for ever. The continuance
          of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">organised</span></em> body, on the contrary,
          just depends upon continual <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">movement</span></em> and the constant
          reception of external influences. As soon as these are wanting and
          the movement in it stops it is dead, and thereby ceases to be
          organic, although the trace of the organism that has been still
          remains for a while. Therefore the talk, which is so much affected
          in our own day, of the life of what is unorganised, indeed of the
          globe itself, and that it, and also the planetary system, is an
          organism, is entirely inadmissible. The predicate life belongs only
          to what is organised. Every organism, however, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page037">[pg 037]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg037"></a> is throughout organised, is so in all
          its parts; and nowhere are these, even in their smallest particles,
          composed by aggregation of what is unorganised. Thus if the earth
          were an organism, all mountains and rocks, and the whole interior
          of their mass, would necessarily be organised, and accordingly
          really nothing unorganised would exist; and therefore the whole
          conception of it would be wanting.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the other
          hand, that the manifestation of a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em> is
          as little bound up with life and organisation as with knowledge,
          and that therefore the unorganised has also a will, the
          manifestations of which are all its fundamental qualities, which
          cannot be further explained,—this is an essential point in my
          doctrine; although the trace of such a thought is far seldomer
          found in writers who have preceded me than that of the will in
          plants, where, however, it is still unconscious.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the forming
          of the crystal we see, as it were, a tendency towards an attempt at
          life, to which, however, it does not attain, because the fluidity
          of which, like a living thing, it is composed at the moment of that
          movement is not enclosed in a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">skin</span></em>, as is always the case with
          the latter, and consequently it has neither vessels in which that
          movement could go on, nor does anything separate it from the
          external world. Therefore, rigidity at once seizes that momentary
          movement, of which only the trace remains as the crystal.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The thought that
          the will, which constitutes the basis of our own nature, is also
          the same will which shows itself even in the lowest unorganised
          phenomena, on account of which the conformity to law of both
          phenomena shows a perfect analogy, lies at the foundation of
          Goethe's <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Wahlverwandtschaften</span></span>,”</span> as
          the title indeed indicates, although he himself was unconscious of
          this.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mechanics and
          astronomy specially show us how this will conducts itself so far as
          it appears at the lowest grade of its manifestation merely as
          gravity, rigidity, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page038">[pg
          038]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg038"></a>
          inertia. Hydraulics shows us the same thing where rigidity is
          wanting and the fluid material is now unrestrainedly surrendered to
          its predominating passion, gravity. In this sense hydraulics may be
          conceived as a characteristic sketch of water, for it presents to
          us the manifestations of will to which water is moved by gravity;
          these always correspond exactly to the external influences, for in
          the case of all non-individual existences there is no particular
          character in addition to the general one; thus they can easily be
          referred to fixed characteristics, which are called laws, and which
          are learned by experience of water. These laws accurately inform us
          how water will conduct itself under all different circumstances, on
          account of its gravity, the unconditioned mobility of its parts,
          and its want of elasticity. Hydrostatics teaches how it is brought
          to rest through gravity; hydrodynamics, how it is set in motion;
          and the latter has also to take account of hindrances which
          adhesion opposes to the will of water: the two together constitute
          hydraulics. In the same way Chemistry teaches us how the will
          conducts itself when the inner qualities of materials obtain free
          play by being brought into a fluid state, and there appears that
          wonderful attraction and repulsion, separating and combining,
          leaving go of one to seize upon another, from which every
          precipitation originates, and the whole of which is denoted by
          <span class="tei tei-q">“elective affinity”</span> (an expression
          which is entirely borrowed from the conscious will). But Anatomy
          and Physiology allow us to see how the will conducts itself in
          order to bring about the phenomenon of life and sustain it for a
          while. Finally, the poet shows us how the will conducts itself
          under the influence of motives and reflection. He exhibits it
          therefore for the most part in the most perfect of its
          manifestations, in rational beings, whose character is individual,
          and whose conduct and suffering he brings before us in the Drama,
          the Epic, the Romance, &amp;c. The more correctly, the more
          strictly according to the laws of nature his characters are there
          presented, the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page039">[pg
          039]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg039"></a>
          greater is his fame; hence Shakespeare stands at the top. The point
          of view which is here taken up corresponds at bottom to the spirit
          in which Goethe followed and loved the natural sciences, although
          he was not conscious of the matter in the abstract. Nay more, this
          not only appears from his writings, but is also known to me from
          his personal utterances.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If we consider
          the will, where no one denies it, in conscious beings, we find
          everywhere, as its fundamental effort, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">self-preservation</span></em> of every being:
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">omnis natura vult esse conservatrix
          sui</span></span>. But all manifestations of this fundamental
          effort may constantly be traced back to a seeking or pursuit and a
          shunning or fleeing from, according to the occasion. Now this also
          may be shown even at the lowest grades of nature, that is, of the
          objectification of the will, where the bodies still act only as
          bodies in general, thus are the subject-matter of mechanics, and
          are considered only with reference to the manifestations of
          impenetrability, cohesion, rigidity, elasticity, and gravity. Here
          also the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">seeking</span></em> shows itself as
          gravitation, and the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">shunning</span></em> as the receiving of
          motion; and the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">movableness</span></em> of bodies by pressure
          or impact, which constitutes the basis of mechanics, is at bottom a
          manifestation of the effort after <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">self-preservation</span></em>, which dwells in
          them also. For, since as bodies they are impenetrable, this is the
          sole means of preserving their cohesion, thus their continuance at
          any time. The body which is impelled or exposed to pressure would
          be crushed to pieces by the impelling or pressing body if it did
          not withdraw itself from its power by flight, in order to preserve
          its cohesion; and when flight is impossible for it this actually
          happens. Indeed, one may regard <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">elastic</span></em>
          bodies as the more <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">courageous</span></em>, which seek to repel
          the enemy, or at least to prevent him from pursuing further. Thus
          in the one secret which (besides gravity) is left by mechanics
          otherwise so clear, in the communicability of motion, we see a
          manifestation of the fundamental effort of the will in all its
          phenomena, the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page040">[pg
          040]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg040"></a>
          effort after self-preservation, which shows itself even at the
          lowest grades as that which is essential.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In unorganised
          nature the will objectifies itself primarily in the universal
          forces, and only by means of these in the phenomena of the
          particular things which are called forth by causes. In § 26 of the
          first volume I have fully explained the relation between cause,
          force of nature, and will as thing in itself. One sees from that
          explanation that metaphysics never interrupts the course of
          physics, but only takes up the thread where physics leaves it, at
          the original forces in which all causal explanation has its limits.
          Only here does the metaphysical explanation from the will as the
          thing in itself begin. In the case of every physical phenomenon, of
          every <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">change</span></em> of material things, its
          cause is primarily to be looked for; and this cause is just such a
          particular <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">change</span></em> which has appeared
          immediately before it. Then, however, the original force of nature
          is to be sought by virtue of which this cause was capable of
          acting. And first of all the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em> is to be recognised as the
          inner nature of this force in opposition to its manifestation. Yet
          the will shows itself just as directly in the fall of a stone as in
          the action of the man; the difference is only that its particular
          manifestation is in the one case called forth by a motive, in the
          other by a mechanically acting cause, for example, the taking away
          of what supported the stone; yet in both cases with equal
          necessity; and that in the one case it depends upon an individual
          character, in the other upon an universal force of nature. This
          identity of what is fundamentally essential is even made palpable
          to the senses. If, for instance, we carefully observe a body which
          has lost its equilibrium, and on account of its special form rolls
          back and forward for a long time till it finds its centre of
          gravity again, a certain appearance of life forces itself upon us,
          and we directly feel that something analogous to the foundation of
          life is also active here. This is certainly the universal force of
          nature, which, however, in itself identical with the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em>,
          becomes <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page041">[pg
          041]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg041"></a>
          here, as it were, the soul of a very brief <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">quasi</span></span> life. Thus what is
          identical in the two extremes of the manifestation of the will
          makes itself faintly known here even to direct perception, in that
          this raises a feeling in us that here also something entirely
          original, such as we only know in the acts of our own will,
          directly succeeded in manifesting itself.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We may attain to
          an intuitive knowledge of the existence and activity of the will in
          unorganised nature in quite a different and a sublime manner if we
          study the problem of the three heavenly bodies, and thus learn more
          accurately and specially the course of the moon round the earth. By
          the different combinations which the constant change of the
          position of these three heavenly bodies towards each other
          introduces, the course of the moon is now accelerated; now
          retarded, now it approaches the earth, and again recedes from it;
          and this again takes place differently in the perihelion of the
          earth from in its aphelion, all of which together introduces such
          irregularity into the moon's course that it really obtains a
          capricious appearance; for, indeed, Kepler's third law is no longer
          constantly valid, but in equal times it describes unequal areas.
          The consideration of this course is a small and separate chapter of
          celestial mechanics, which is distinguished in a sublime manner
          from terrestrial mechanics by the absence of all impact and
          pressure, thus of the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">vis a
          tergo</span></span> which appears to us so intelligible, and indeed
          of the actually completed case, for besides <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">vis inertiœ</span></span> it knows no other
          moving and directing force, except only gravitation, that longing
          for union which proceeds from the very inner nature of bodies. If
          now we construct for ourselves in imagination the working of this
          given case in detail, we recognise distinctly and directly in the
          moving force here that which is given to us in self-consciousness
          as will. For the alterations in the course of the earth and the
          moon, according as one of them is by its position more or less
          exposed to the influence of the sun, are evidently analogous to the
          influence of newly appearing motives <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page042">[pg 042]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg042"></a> upon our wills, and to the modifications of
          our action which result.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The following is
          an illustrative example of another kind. Liebig (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Chemie in Anwendung
          auf Agrikultur</span></span>, p. 501), says: <span class="tei tei-q">“If we bring moist copper into air which contains
          carbonic acid, the affinity of the metal for the oxygen of the air
          will be increased by the contact with this acid to such a degree
          that the two will combine with each other; its surface will be
          coated with green carbonic oxide of copper. But now two bodies
          which have the capacity of combining, the moment they meet assume
          opposite electrical conditions. Therefore if we touch the copper
          with iron, by producing a special electrical state, the capacity of
          the copper to enter into combination with the oxygen is destroyed;
          even under the above conditions it remains bright.”</span> The fact
          is well known and of technical use. I quote it in order to say that
          here the will of the copper, laid claim to and occupied by the
          electrical opposition to iron, leaves unused the opportunity which
          presents itself for its chemical affinity for oxygen and carbonic
          acid. Accordingly it conducts itself exactly as the will in a man
          who omits an action which he would otherwise feel himself moved to
          in order to perform another to which a stronger motive urges
          him.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I have shown in
          the first volume that the forces of nature lie outside the chain of
          causes and effects, because they constitute their accompanying
          condition, their metaphysical foundation, and therefore prove
          themselves to be eternal and omnipresent, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          independent of time and space. Even in the uncontested truth that
          what is essential to a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cause</span></em> as such consists in this,
          that it will produce the same effect at any future time as it does
          now, it is already involved that something lies in the cause which
          is independent of the course of time, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          is outside of all time; this is the force of nature which manifests
          itself in it. One can even convince oneself to a certain extent
          empirically and as a matter of fact of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ideality</span></em> of this <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page043">[pg 043]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg043"></a> form of our perception by fixing one's
          eyes upon the powerlessness of time as opposed to natural forces.
          If, for example, a rotatory motion is imparted to a planet by some
          external cause, if no new cause enters to stop it, this motion will
          endure for ever. This could not be so if time were something in
          itself and had an objective, real existence; for then it would
          necessarily also produce some effect. Thus we see here, on the one
          hand, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">forces of nature</span></em>, which manifest
          themselves in that rotation, and, if it is once begun, carry it on
          for ever without becoming weary or dying out, prove themselves to
          be eternal or timeless, and consequently absolutely real and
          existing in themselves; and, on the other hand, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">time</span></em> as
          something which consists only in the manner in which we apprehend
          that phenomenon, since it exerts no power and no influence upon the
          phenomenon itself; for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">what does not act is not</span></em>.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have a
          natural inclination whenever it is possible to explain every
          natural phenomenon <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mechanically</span></em>; doubtless because
          mechanics calls in the assistance of the fewest original, and hence
          inexplicable, forces, and, on the other hand, contains much that
          can be known <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span>, and
          therefore depends upon the forms of our own intellect, which as
          such carries with it the highest degree of comprehensibility and
          clearness. However, in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Metaphysical
          First Principles of Natural Science”</span> Kant has referred
          mechanical activity itself to a dynamical activity. On the other
          hand, the application of mechanical explanatory hypotheses, beyond
          what is demonstrably mechanical, to which, for example, Acoustics
          also belongs, is entirely unjustified, and I will never believe
          that even the simplest chemical combination or the difference of
          the three states of aggregation will ever admit of mechanical
          explanation, much less the properties of light, of heat, and
          electricity. These will always admit only of a dynamical
          explanation, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, one which explains the
          phenomenon from original forces which are entirely different from
          those of impact, pressure, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page044">[pg 044]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg044"></a> weight, &amp;c., and are therefore of a
          higher kind, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, are more distinct
          objectifications of that will which obtains visible form in all
          things. I am of opinion that light is neither an emanation nor a
          vibration; both views are akin to that which explains transparency
          from pores and the evident falseness of which is proved by the fact
          that light is subject to no mechanical laws. In order to obtain
          direct conviction of this one only requires to watch the effects of
          a storm of wind, which bends, upsets, and scatters everything, but
          during which a ray of light shooting down from a break in the
          clouds is entirely undisturbed and steadier than a rock, so that
          with great directness it imparts to us the knowledge that it
          belongs to another order of things than the mechanical: it stands
          there unmoved like a ghost. Those constructions of light from
          molecules and atoms which have originated with the French are
          indeed a revolting absurdity. An article by Ampère, who is
          otherwise so acute, upon light and heat, which is to be found in
          the April number of the <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Annales de chimie et
          physique</span></span>,”</span> of 1835, may be considered as a
          flagrant expression of this, and indeed of the whole of atomism in
          general. There the solid, the fluid, and the elastic consist of the
          same atoms, and all differences arise solely from their
          aggregation; nay, it is said that space indeed is infinitely
          divisible, but not matter; because, if the division has been
          carried as far as the atoms, the further division must fall in the
          spaces between the atoms! Light and heat, then, are here vibrations
          of the atoms; and sound, on the other hand, is a vibration of the
          molecules composed of the atoms. In truth, however, these atoms are
          a fixed idea of the French savants, and therefore they just speak
          of them as if they had seen them. Otherwise one would necessarily
          marvel that such a matter-of-fact nation as the French can hold so
          firmly to a completely transcendent hypothesis, which is quite
          beyond the possibility of experience, and confidently build upon it
          up to the sky. This is just a consequence of the backward
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page045">[pg 045]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg045"></a> state of the
          metaphysics they shun so much, which is poorly represented by M.
          Cousin, who, with all good will, is shallow and very scantily
          endowed with judgment. At bottom they are still Lockeians, owing to
          the earlier influence of Condillac. Therefore for them the thing in
          itself is really matter, from the fundamental properties of which,
          such as impenetrability, form, hardness, and the other primary
          qualities, everything in the world must be ultimately explicable.
          They will not let themselves be talked out of this, and their tacit
          assumption is that matter can only be moved by mechanical forces.
          In Germany Kant's teaching has prevented the continuance of the
          absurdities of the atomistic and purely mechanical physics for any
          length of time; although at the present moment these views prevail
          here also, which is a consequence of the shallowness, crudeness,
          and folly introduced by Hegel. However, it cannot be denied that
          not only the evidently porous nature of natural bodies, but also
          two special doctrines of modern physics, apparently render
          assistance to the atomic nuisance. These are, Hauz's
          Crystallography, which traces every crystal back to its kernel
          form, which is an ultimate form, though only <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">relatively</span></em> indivisible; and
          Berzelius's doctrine of chemical atoms, which are yet mere
          expressions for combining proportions, thus only arithmetical
          quantities, and at bottom nothing more than counters. On the other
          hand, Kant's thesis in the second antinomy in defence of atoms,
          which is certainly only set up for dialectical purposes, is a mere
          sophism, as I have proved in my criticism of his philosophy, and
          our understanding itself by no means leads us necessarily to the
          assumption of atoms. For just as little as I am obliged to think
          that the slow but constant and uniform <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">motion</span></em>
          of a body before my eyes is composed of innumerable motions which
          are absolutely quick, but broken and interrupted by just as many
          absolutely short moments of rest, but, on the contrary, know very
          well that the stone that has been thrown flies more <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page046">[pg 046]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg046"></a> slowly than the projected bullet, yet
          never pauses for an instant on the way, so little am I obliged to
          think of the mass of a body as consisting of atoms and the spaces
          between them, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, of absolute density and
          absolute vacuity; but I comprehend those two phenomena without
          difficulty as constant <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">continua</span></span>, one of which uniformly
          fills time and the other space. But just as the one motion may yet
          be quicker than another, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, in an equal time can pass
          through more space, so also one body may have a greater specific
          gravity than another, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, in equal space may contain
          more matter: in both cases the difference depends upon the
          intensity of the acting force; for Kant (following Priestley) has
          quite correctly reduced matter to forces. But even if the analogy
          here set up should not be admitted as valid, and it should be
          insisted upon that the difference of specific gravity can only have
          its ground in porosity, even this assumption would always lead, not
          to atoms, but only to a perfectly dense matter, unequally
          distributed among different bodies; a matter which would certainly
          be no longer <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">compressible</span></em>, when no pores ran
          through it, but yet, like the space which it fills, would always
          remain infinitely <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">divisible</span></em>. For the fact that it
          would have no pores by no means involves that no possible force
          could do away with the continuity of its spatial parts. For to say
          that everywhere this is only possible by extending the already
          existing intervals is a purely arbitrary assertion.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The assumption
          of atoms rests upon the two phenomena which have been touched upon,
          the difference of the specific gravity of bodies and that of their
          compressibility, for both are conveniently explained by the
          assumption of atoms. But then both must also always be present in
          like measure, which is by no means the case. For, for example,
          water has a far lower specific gravity than all metals properly so
          called. It must thus have fewer atoms and greater interstices
          between them, and consequently be very compressible: but it is
          almost entirely incompressible.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page047">[pg 047]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg047"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The defence of
          atoms might be conducted in this way. One may start from porosity
          and say something of this sort: All bodies have pores, and
          therefore so also have all parts of a body: now if this were
          carried out to infinity, there would ultimately be nothing left of
          a body but pores. The refutation would be that what remained over
          would certainly have to be assumed as without pores, and so far as
          absolutely dense, yet not on that account as consisting of
          absolutely indivisible particles, atoms; accordingly it would
          certainly be absolutely incompressible, but not absolutely
          indivisible. It would therefore be necessary that it should be
          asserted that the division of a body is only possible by
          penetrating into its pores; which, however, is entirely unproved.
          If, however, this is assumed, then we certainly have atoms,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, absolutely indivisible
          bodies, thus bodies of such strong cohesion of their spatial parts
          that no possible power can separate them: but then one may just as
          well assume such bodies to be large as small, and an atom might be
          as big as an ox, if it only would resist all possible attacks upon
          it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Imagine two
          bodies of very different kinds, entirely freed from all pores by
          compression, as by means of hammering, or by pulverisation;—would
          their specific gravity then be the same? This would be the
          criterion of dynamics.</p>

<span style="font-size: 144%">Chapter XXIV. On Matter.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Matter has
          already been spoken of in the fourth chapter of the supplements to
          the first book, when we were considering the part of our knowledge
          of which we are conscious <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          priori</span></span>. But it could only be considered there from a
          one-sided point of view, because we were then concerned merely with
          its relation to the forms of our intellect, and not to the thing in
          itself, and therefore we investigated it only from the subjective
          side, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, so far as it is an idea,
          and not from the objective side, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          with regard to what it may be in itself. In the first respect, our
          conclusion was that it is objective <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">activity</span></em> in general, yet conceived
          without fuller determination; therefore it takes the place of
          causality in the table of our <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          priori</span></span> knowledge which is given there. For what is
          material is that which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">acts</span></em> (the actual) in general, and
          regarded apart from the specific nature of its action. Hence also
          matter, merely as such, is not an object of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">perception</span></em>, but only of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thought</span></em>, and thus is really an
          abstraction. It only comes into perception in connection with form
          and quality, as a body, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, as a fully determined kind
          of activity. It is only by abstracting from this fuller
          determination that we think of matter as such, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          separated from form and quality; consequently under matter we think
          of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">acting</span></em> absolutely and in general,
          thus of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">activity</span></em> in the abstract. The more
          fully determined acting we then conceive as the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">accident</span></em> of matter; but only by
          means of this does matter become perceptible, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          present itself as a body and an <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page049">[pg 049]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg049"></a> object of experience. Pure matter, on the
          other hand, which, as I have shown in the Criticism of the Kantian
          Philosophy, alone constitutes the true and admissible content of
          the conception of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">substance</span></em>, is causality itself,
          thought objectively, consequently as in space, and therefore
          filling it. Accordingly the whole being of matter consists in
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">acting</span></em>. Only thus does it occupy
          space and last in time. It is through and through pure causality.
          Therefore wherever there is action there is matter, and the
          material is the active in general. But causality itself is the form
          of our understanding; for it is known to us <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          priori</span></span>, as well as time and space. Thus matter also,
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">so
          far</span></em> and up to this point, belongs to the formal part of
          our knowledge, and is consequently that form of the understanding,
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">causality</span></em> itself, bound up with
          space and time, hence objectified, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          conceived as that which fills space. (The fuller explanation of
          this doctrine will be found in the second edition of the essay on
          the principle of sufficient reason, p. 77; third edition, p. 82.)
          So far, however, matter is properly not the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">object</span></em>
          but the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">condition</span></em> of experience; like the
          pure understanding itself, whose function it so far is. Therefore
          of pure matter there is also only a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">conception</span></em>, no <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">perception</span></em>. It enters into all
          external experience as a necessary constituent part of it; yet it
          cannot be given in any experience, but is only <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thought</span></em>, and thought indeed as
          that which is absolutely inert, inactive, formless, and without
          qualities, and which is yet the supporter of all forms, qualities,
          and effects. Accordingly, of all fleeting phenomena, thus of all
          manifestations of natural forces and all living beings, matter is
          the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">permanent substratum</span></em> which is
          necessarily produced by the forms of our intellect in which the
          world as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">idea</span></em> exhibits itself. As such, and
          as having sprung from the forms of the intellect, it is entirely
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">indifferent</span></em> to those phenomena
          themselves, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, it is just as ready to be
          the supporter of this force of nature as of that, whenever, under
          the guidance of causality, the necessary <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page050">[pg 050]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg050"></a> conditions appear; while it itself, just
          because its existence is really only <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">formal</span></em>,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, is founded in the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intellect</span></em> must be thought as that
          which under all that change is absolutely permanent, thus with
          regard to time is without beginning and without end. This is why we
          cannot give up the thought that anything may be made out of
          anything, for example, gold out of lead; for this would only
          require that we should find out and bring about the intermediate
          states which matter, in itself indifferent, would have to pass
          through upon that path. For <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          priori</span></span> we can never see why the same matter which is
          now the supporter of the quality lead could not some time become
          the supporter of the quality gold. Matter, as that which is only
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thought</span></em> <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          priori</span></span>, is distinguished from the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intuitions</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">perceptions</span></em> proper by the fact
          that we can also think it entirely away; space and time, on the
          contrary, never. But this only shows that we can present to
          ourselves space and time in imagination without matter. For the
          matter which has once been placed in them, and accordingly thought
          as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">existing</span></em>, we can never again
          absolutely think away, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, imagine it as vanished and
          annihilated, but are always forced to think of it merely as
          transferred to another space. So far, then, matter is as
          inseparably connected with our faculty of knowledge as space and
          time themselves. Yet even the difference that it must first be
          voluntarily thought as existing indicates that it does not belong
          so entirely and in every regard to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">formal</span></em>
          part of our knowledge as space and time, but also contains an
          element which is only given <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          posteriori</span></span>. It is, in fact, the point of connection
          of the empirical part of our knowledge with the pure and
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span> part, consequently the
          peculiar foundation-stone of the world of experience.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Only where all
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span> assertions cease,
          therefore in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">entirely empirical</span></em> part of our
          knowledge of bodies, in their form, quality, and definite manner of
          acting, does that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em> reveal itself which we have
          already recognised and established as the true inner nature of
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page051">[pg 051]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg051"></a> things. But these
          forms and qualities always appear only as the properties and
          manifestations of that very <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">matter</span></em> the existence and nature of
          which depends upon the subjective forms of our intellect,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, they only become visible
          in it, and therefore by means of it. For that which always exhibits
          itself to us is only <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">matter</span></em> acting in some specially
          determined manner. Out of the inner properties of such matter,
          properties which cannot be further explained, proceeds every
          definite kind of effect of given bodies; and yet the matter itself
          is never perceived, but only these effects, and the definite
          properties which lie at their foundation, after separating which,
          matter, as that which then remains over, is necessarily added in
          thought by us; for, according to the exposition given above, it is
          objectified <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">causality itself</span></em>. Accordingly
          matter is that whereby the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em>, which constitutes the inner
          nature of things, becomes capable of being apprehended,
          perceptible, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">visible</span></em>. In this sense, then,
          matter is simply the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">visibility</span></em> of the will, or the
          bond between the world as will and the world as idea. It belongs to
          the latter inasmuch as it is the product of the functions of the
          intellect, to the former inasmuch as that which manifests itself in
          all material existences, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, phenomena is the will.
          Therefore every object is, as thing in itself, will, and as
          phenomenon, matter. If we could strip any given matter of all the
          properties that come to it <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          priori</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, of all the forms of our
          perception and apprehension, we would have left the thing in
          itself, that which, by means of those forms, appears as the purely
          empirical in matter, but which would then itself no longer appear
          as something extended and active; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          we would no longer have matter before us, but the will. This very
          thing in itself, or the will, in that it becomes a phenomenon,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, enters the forms of our
          intellect, appears as matter, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, as the invisible but
          necessarily assumed supporter of the properties which are only
          visible through it. In this sense, then, matter is the visibility
          of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em>. Consequently Plotinus and
          Giordano Bruno <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page052">[pg
          052]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg052"></a>
          were right, not only in their sense but also in ours, when they
          made the paradoxical assertion already referred to in chapter 4:
          Matter itself is not extended, consequently it is incorporeal. For
          space, which is our form of perception, imparts extension to
          matter, and corporeal existence consists in acting, which depends
          upon causality, and consequently upon the form of our
          understanding. On the other hand, every definite property, thus
          everything empirical in matter, even gravity, depends upon that
          which only becomes visible by means of matter, the thing in itself,
          the will. Gravity is yet the lowest of all grades of the
          objectification of the will; therefore it appears in all matter
          without exception, thus is inseparable from matter in general. Yet,
          just because it is a manifestation of the will, it belongs to
          knowledge <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a posteriori</span></span>,
          not to knowledge <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span>.
          Therefore we can always picture to ourselves matter without weight,
          but not without extension, repulsive force, and stability, for then
          it would be without impenetrability, and consequently would not
          occupy space, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, it would be without
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the power
          of acting</span></em>; but the nature of matter as such just
          consists in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">acting</span></em>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          in causality in general; and causality depends upon the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span> form of our
          understanding, and therefore cannot be thought away.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Matter is
          accordingly the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em> itself, but no longer in
          itself, but so far as it is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">perceived</span></em>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          assumes the form of the objective idea. Thus what objectively is
          matter is subjectively will. Exactly corresponding to this, as was
          proved above, our body is just the visibility, objectivity of our
          will, and so also every body is the objectivity of the will at some
          one of its grades. Whenever the will exhibits itself to objective
          knowledge it enters into the forms of perception of the intellect,
          time, space, and causality. But on account of this it exists at
          once as a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">material</span></em> object. We can present to
          our minds form without matter, but not the reverse; because matter
          deprived of form would be the will itself, and the will
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page053">[pg 053]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg053"></a> only becomes
          objective by entering the forms of perception of our intellect, and
          therefore only by means of the assumption of form. Space is the
          form of perception of matter because the latter is the substance
          (Stoff) of mere form, but matter can <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">appear</span></em>
          only in form.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Since the will
          becomes objective, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, passes over into the idea,
          matter is the universal substratum of this objectification, or
          rather it is this objectification itself taken abstractly,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, regarded apart from all
          form. Matter is accordingly the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">visibility</span></em> of the will in general,
          while the character of its definite manifestations has its
          expression in form and quality. Hence what in the manifestation,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, for the idea, is
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">matter</span></em> is in itself <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em>.
          Therefore, under the conditions of experience and perception,
          everything holds good of it that holds good of the will in itself,
          and it repeats all the relations and properties of the will in
          temporal images. Accordingly it is the substance of the world of
          perception, as the will is the inner nature of all things. The
          forms are innumerable, the matter is one; just as the will is one
          in all its objectifications. As the will never objectifies itself
          as general, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, as absolute will, but
          always as particular, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, under special
          determinations and a given character, so matter never appears as
          such, but always in connection with some particular form and
          quality. In the manifestation or objectification of the will matter
          represents its totality, it itself, which in all is one, as matter
          is one in all bodies. As the will is the inmost kernel of all
          phenomenal beings, so matter is the substance which remains after
          all the accidents have been taken away. As the will is that which
          is absolutely indestructible in all existence, so matter is that
          which is imperishable in time and permanent through all changes.
          That matter for itself, thus separated from form, cannot be
          perceived or presented in imagination depends upon the fact that in
          itself, and as the pure substantiality of bodies, it is really the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em> itself. But the will cannot
          be apprehended <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page054">[pg
          054]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg054"></a>
          objectively, or perceived in itself, but only under all the
          conditions of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">idea</span></em>, and therefore only as
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">phenomenon</span></em>. Under these
          conditions, however, it exhibits itself at once as body,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, as matter clothed in form
          and quality. But form is conditioned by space, and quality or power
          of acting by causality; thus both depend upon the functions of the
          intellect. Matter without them would just be the thing in itself,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the will itself.
          Therefore, as has been said, Plotinus and Giordano Bruno could only
          be brought by a completely objective path to the assertion that
          matter in and for itself is without extension, consequently without
          spatial properties, consequently incorporeal.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Because, then,
          matter is the visibility of the will, and every force in itself is
          will, no force can appear without a material substratum, and
          conversely no body can be without forces dwelling in it which
          constitute its quality. Therefore a body is the union of matter and
          form which is called substance (Stoff). Force and substance are
          inseparable because at bottom they are one; for, as Kant has shown,
          matter itself is given us only as the union of two forces, the
          force of expansion and that of attraction. Thus there is no
          opposition between force and substance, rather they are precisely
          one.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Led by the
          course of our consideration to this standpoint, and having attained
          to this metaphysical view of matter, we will confess without
          reluctance that the temporal <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">origin</span></em> of forms, shapes, or
          species cannot reasonably be sought elsewhere than in matter. Some
          time or other they must have come forth from it, just because it is
          the mere <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">visibility of the will</span></em> which
          constitutes the inner nature of all phenomena. In that the will
          manifests itself, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, presents itself <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">objectively</span></em> to the intellect,
          matter, as its visibility, assumes <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">form</span></em> by
          means of the functions of the intellect. Hence the Schoolmen said:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Materia appetit
          formam</span></span>.”</span> That such was the origin of all forms
          of life cannot be doubted: we cannot even conceive it otherwise.
          Whether, however, now, since the paths to the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page055">[pg 055]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg055"></a> perpetuation of the forms stand open,
          and are secured and sustained by nature with boundless care and
          jealousy, <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">generatio
          œquivoca</span></span> still takes place, can only be decided by
          experience; especially since the saying, <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Natura nihil facit frustra</span></span>,
          might, with reference to the paths of regular propagation, be used
          as a valid argument against it. Yet in spite of the most recent
          objections to it, I hold that at very low grades <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">generatio œquivoca</span></span> is very
          probable, and primarily indeed in the case of entozoa and epizoa,
          particularly such as appear in consequence of special cachexia of
          the animal organism. For the conditions of their life only appear
          exceptionally; consequently their species cannot propagate itself
          in the regular manner, and therefore has always to arise anew
          whenever opportunity offers. Therefore as soon as the conditions of
          life of epizoa have appeared in consequence of certain chronic
          diseases, or cachexia, and in accordance with them, <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">pediculus capitis</span></span> or <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">pubis</span></span> or <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">corporis</span></span> appears entirely of
          itself, and without any egg; and this notwithstanding the complex
          structure of these insects, for the putrefaction of a living animal
          body affords material for higher productions than that of hay in
          water, which only produces infusoria. Or is it thought more likely
          that the eggs of the epizoa are constantly floating about in the
          air in expectation? (Fearful to think of!) Let us rather remember
          the disease of phthiriasis, which occurs even now. An analogous
          case takes place when through special circumstances the conditions
          of life appear of a species which up till then was foreign to that
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">place</span></em>. Thus August St. Hilaire saw
          in Brazil, after the burning of a primitive forest, as soon as ever
          the ashes had cooled, a number of plants grow up out of them, the
          species of which was not to be found far and wide; and quite
          recently Admiral Petit-Thouars informed the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Académie des
          sciences</span></span> that upon the growing coral islands in
          Polynesia a soil gradually deposits itself which is now dry, now
          lies in water, and which vegetation soon takes possession of,
          bringing forth trees which are absolutely <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page056">[pg 056]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg056"></a> peculiar to these islands (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Comptes
          rendus</span></span>, 17th Jan. 1859, p. 147). Whenever
          putrefaction takes place mould, fungi, and in liquids infusoria
          appear. The assumption now in favour that spores and eggs of the
          innumerable species of all those kinds of animal life are
          everywhere floating in the air, and wait through long years for a
          favourable opportunity, is more paradoxical than that of
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">generatio œquivoca</span></span>. Putrefaction
          is the decomposition of an organised body, first into its
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">more
          immediate</span></em> chemical constituents. Since now these are
          more or less the same in all living beings, the omnipresent will to
          live can possess itself of them, in order, in accordance with the
          circumstances, to produce new existences from them; and these
          forming themselves according to design, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          objectifying the volition of the will at the time, solidify out of
          the chemical elements as the chicken out of the fluidity of the
          egg. When, however, this does not take place, the putrefying matter
          is resolved into its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ultimate</span></em> constituent parts, which
          are the chemical elements, and now passes over again into the great
          course of nature. The war which has been waged for the last ten or
          fifteen years against <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">generatio
          œquivoca</span></span>, with its premature shouts of victory, was
          the prelude to the denial of the vital force, and related to it.
          Let no one, however, be deceived by dogmatic assertions and brazen
          assurances that the questions are decided, settled, and generally
          recognised. On the contrary, the whole mechanical and atomistic
          view of nature is approaching its bankruptcy, and its defenders
          have to learn that something more is concealed behind nature than
          action and reaction. The reality of <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">generatio œquivoca</span></span> and the folly
          of the extraordinary assumption that in the atmosphere, everywhere
          and always, billions of seeds of all possible kinds of fungi, and
          eggs of all possible kinds of infusoria, are floating about, till
          now one and then another by chance finds its suitable medium, has
          quite recently (1859) been thoroughly and victoriously shown by
          Pouchet <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page057">[pg
          057]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg057"></a>
          before the French Academy, to the great vexation of the other
          members.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Our wonder at
          the origin of forms in matter is at bottom like that of the savage
          who looks for the first time in a mirror and marvels at his own
          image which he sees there. For our own inner nature is the will,
          whose mere <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">visibility</span></em> is matter. Yet matter
          never appears otherwise than with the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">visible</span></em>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          under the outer shell of form and quality, and therefore is never
          directly apprehended, but always merely added in thought as that
          which is identical in all things, under all differences of quality
          and form. On this account it is more a metaphysical than a physical
          principle of explanation of things, and to make all existences
          arise from it is really to explain them from something which is
          very mysterious; which all know it to be except those who confound
          attacking with comprehending. In truth, the ultimate and exhaustive
          explanation of things is by no means to be sought in matter,
          although certainly the temporal origin both of unorganised forms
          and of organised beings is to be sought in it. Yet it seems that
          the origination of organised forms, the production of the species
          themselves, is almost as difficult for nature to accomplish as it
          is for us to comprehend. This is indicated by the entirely
          extravagant provision which nature always makes for maintaining the
          species which once exist. Yet on the present surface of this planet
          the will to live has gone through the scale of its objectification
          three times, quite independently of each other, in a different
          modulation, and also with great difference of perfection and
          fulness. The old world, America, and Australia have, it is well
          known, each their peculiar independent fauna, entirely different
          from that of the other two. Upon each of these great continents the
          species are throughout different, but yet, because all three belong
          to the same planet, they have a thorough analogy with each other
          running parallel through them; therefore the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">genera</span></span> are for the most part the
          same. In Australia <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page058">[pg
          058]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg058"></a>
          this analogy can only be very imperfectly followed because its
          fauna is very poor in mammalia, and contains neither beasts of prey
          nor apes. On the other hand, between the old world and America it
          is obvious, and in the following manner. In mammals America always
          produces the inferior analogue, but in birds and reptiles the
          better. Thus it has the advantage in the condor, the macaw, the
          humming-bird, and the largest batrachia and ophidia; but, for
          example, instead of the elephant it has only the tapir, instead of
          the lion the puma, instead of the tiger the jaguar, instead of the
          camel the lama, and instead of apes proper only monkeys. Even from
          this last defect it may be concluded that in America nature was not
          able to rise to man; for even from the nearest grade below man, the
          chimpanzee and the orang-outang or pongo, the step to man was still
          an excessively great one. Correspondingly we find that the three
          races of men which, both upon physiological and linguistic grounds,
          are undoubtedly equally original, the Caucasian, the Mongolian, and
          the Ethiopian, are only at home in the old world; while America, on
          the other hand, is peopled by a mixed or climatically modified
          Mongolian race, which must have come over from Asia. On the surface
          of the earth which immediately preceded the present surface apes
          were reached here and there, but not men.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From this
          standpoint of our consideration, which shows us matter as the
          direct visibility of the will which manifests itself in all things,
          nay, indeed, for the merely physical investigation which follows
          the guidance of time and causality, lets it pass as the origin of
          things, we are easily led to the question whether even in
          philosophy we could not just as well start from the objective as
          from the subjective side, and accordingly set up as the fundamental
          truth the proposition: <span class="tei tei-q">“There is in general
          nothing but matter and its indwelling forces.”</span> But, with
          regard to these <span class="tei tei-q">“indwelling forces”</span>
          here so easily used, we must remember that their assumption leads
          every explanation <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page059">[pg
          059]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg059"></a>
          back to a completely incomprehensible miracle, and then leaves it
          beside it, or rather leaves it to begin from it. For every
          definite, inexplicable force of nature which lies at the foundation
          of the most different kinds of effects of an unorganised body, not
          less than the vital force which manifests itself in every organised
          body, is such an incomprehensible miracle, as I have fully
          explained in chap. 17, and have also shown that physics can never
          be set upon the throne of metaphysics, just because it leaves quite
          untouched the assumption referred to and also many others; whereby
          from the beginning it renounces all claim to give an ultimate
          explanation of things. I must further remind the reader here of the
          proof of the insufficiency of materialism, which is given towards
          the end of the first chapter, because, as was said there, it is the
          philosophy of the subject which forgets itself in its calculation.
          But all these truths rest upon the fact that everything <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">objective</span></em>, everything external,
          since it is always only something apprehended, something known,
          remains also always indirect and secondary, therefore absolutely
          never can become the ultimate ground of explanation of things or
          the starting-point of philosophy. Philosophy necessarily requires
          what is absolutely immediate for its starting-point. But clearly
          only that which is given in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">self-consciousness</span></em> fulfils this
          condition, that which is within, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">subjective</span></em>. And hence it is so
          eminent a merit of Descartes that he first made philosophy start
          from self-consciousness. Since then, upon this path, the genuine
          philosophers, especially Locke, Berkeley, and Kant, have gone even
          further, each in his own manner, and in consequence of their
          investigations I was led to recognise and make use, not of one, but
          of two completely different data of immediate knowledge in
          self-consciousness, the idea and the will, by the combined
          application of which one can go further in philosophy, in the same
          proportion as in the case of an algebraical problem one can
          accomplish more if two known quantities are given than if only one
          is given.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page060">[pg
          060]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg060"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In accordance
          with what has been said, the ineradicable falseness of materialism
          primarily consists in the fact that it starts from a <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">petitio principii</span></span>, which when
          more closely considered turns out indeed to be a πρωτον φευδος. It
          starts from the assumption that matter is something absolutely and
          unconditionally given, something existing independently of the
          knowledge of the subject, thus really a thing in itself. It
          attributes to matter (and consequently also to its presuppositions
          time and space) an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">absolute</span></em> existence, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          an existence independent of the perceiving subject; this is its
          fundamental error. Then, if it will go honestly to work, it must
          leave the qualities inherent in the given materials, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          in the substances, together with the natural forces which manifest
          themselves in these, and finally also the vital force, unexplained,
          as unfathomable <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">qualitates
          occultæ</span></span>, and start from them; as physics and
          physiology actually do, because they make no claim to be the
          ultimate explanation of things. But just to avoid this,
          materialism—at least as it has hitherto appeared—has not proceeded
          honestly. It denies all those original forces, for it pretends and
          seems to reduce them all, and ultimately also the vital force, to
          the mere mechanical activity of matter, thus to manifestations of
          impenetrability, form, cohesion, impulsive power, inertia, gravity,
          &amp;c., qualities which certainly have least that is inexplicable
          in themselves, just because they partly depend upon what is known
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span>, consequently on the
          forms of our own intellect, which are the principle of all
          comprehensibility. But the intellect as the condition of all
          objects, and consequently of the whole phenomenal world, is
          entirely ignored by materialism. Its plan is now to refer
          everything qualitative to something merely quantitative, for it
          attributes the former to mere <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">form</span></em> in opposition to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">matter</span></em>
          proper. To matter it leaves, of the properly <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">empirical</span></em> qualities, only gravity,
          because it already appears as something quantitative, the only
          measure of the quantity of the matter. This path necessarily
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page061">[pg 061]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg061"></a> leads it to the
          fiction of atoms, which now become the material out of which it
          thinks to construct the mysterious manifestations of all original
          forces. But here it has really no longer to do with empirically
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">given</span></em> matter, but with a matter
          which is not to be found <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">in rerum
          natura</span></span>, but is rather a mere abstraction of that real
          matter, a matter which would absolutely have no other than those
          mechanical qualities which, with the exception of gravity, can be
          pretty well construed <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          priori</span></span>, just because they depend upon the forms of
          space, time, and causality, and consequently upon our intellect; to
          this poor material, then, it finds itself reduced for the
          construction of its castle in the air.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this way it
          inevitably becomes <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">atomism</span></em>; as happened to it already
          in its childhood in the hands of Leucippus and Democritus, and
          happens to it again now that it has come to a second childhood
          through age; with the French because they have never known the
          Kantian philosophy, and with the Germans because they have
          forgotten it. And indeed it carries it further in this its second
          childhood than in its first. Not merely <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">solid</span></em>
          bodies are supposed to consist of atoms, but liquids, water, air,
          gas, nay, even light, which is supposed to be the undulations of a
          completely hypothetical and altogether unproved ether, consisting
          of atoms, the difference of the rapidity of these undulations
          causing colours. This is an hypothesis which, like the earlier
          Newtonian seven-colour theory, starts from an analogy with music,
          entirely arbitrarily assumed, and then violently carried out. One
          must really be credulous to an unheard-of degree to let oneself be
          persuaded that the innumerable different ether vibrations
          proceeding from the infinite multiplicity of coloured surfaces in
          this varied world could constantly, and each in its own time, run
          through and everywhere cross each other without ever disturbing
          each other, but should rather produce through such tumult and
          confusion the profoundly peaceful aspect of illumined nature and
          art. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page062">[pg 062]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg062"></a> <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Credat Judæus Apella!</span></span> Certainly
          the nature of light is to us a secret; but it is better to confess
          this than to bar the way of future knowledge by bad theories. That
          light is something quite different from a mere mechanical movement,
          undulation, or vibration and tremor, indeed that it is material, is
          shown by its chemical effects, a beautiful series of which was
          recently laid before the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Académie des sciences</span></span> by
          Chevreul, who let sunlight act upon different coloured materials.
          The most beautiful thing in these experiments is, that a white roll
          of paper which has been exposed to the sunlight exhibits the same
          effects, nay, does so even after six months, if during this time it
          has been secured in a firmly closed metal tube. Has, then, the
          tremulation paused for six months, and does it now fall into time
          again? (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Comptes rendus</span></span> of 20th December
          1858.) This whole hypothesis of vibrating ether atoms is not only a
          chimera, but equals in awkward crudeness the worst of Democritus,
          and yet is shameless enough, at the present day, to profess to be
          an established fact, and has thus brought it about that it is
          orthodoxly repeated by a thousand stupid scribblers of all kinds,
          who are devoid of all knowledge of such things, and is believed in
          as a gospel. But the doctrine of atoms in general goes still
          further: it is soon a case of <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Spartam, quam nactus es, orna</span></span>!
          Different perpetual motions are then ascribed to all the atoms,
          revolving, vibrating, &amp;c., according to the office of each; in
          the same way every atom has its atmosphere of ether, or something
          else, and whatever other similar fancies there may be. The fancies
          of Schelling's philosophy of nature and its disciples were for the
          most part ingenious, lofty, or at least witty; but these, on the
          contrary, are clumsy, insipid, paltry, and awkward, the production
          of minds which, in the first place, are unable to think any other
          reality than a fabulous, qualityless matter, which is also an
          absolute object, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, an object without a
          subject; and secondly can think of no other activity than motion
          and impact: these two alone are comprehensible to them, and that
          everything <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page063">[pg
          063]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg063"></a>
          runs back to these is their <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          priori</span></span> assumption; for these are their <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thing in
          itself</span></em>. To attain this end the vital force is reduced
          to chemical forces (which are insidiously and unjustifiably called
          molecular forces), and all processes of unorganised nature to
          mechanism, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, to action and reaction.
          And thus at last the whole world and everything in it becomes
          merely a piece of mechanical ingenuity, like the toys worked by
          levers, wheels, and sand, which represent a mine or the work on a
          farm. The source of the evil is, that through the amount of
          hand-work which experimenting requires the head-work of thinking
          has been allowed to get out of practice. The crucible and the
          voltaic pile are supposed to assume its functions; hence also the
          profound abhorrence of all philosophy.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the matter
          might be put in this way. One might say that materialism, as it has
          hitherto appeared, has only failed because it did not adequately
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">know</span></em> the matter out of which it
          thought to construct the world, and therefore was dealing, not with
          matter itself, but with a propertyless substitute for it. If, on
          the contrary, instead of this, it had taken the actual and
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">empirically</span></em> given matter
          (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, material substance, or
          rather substances), endowed as it is with all physical, chemical,
          electrical properties, and also with the power of spontaneously
          producing life out of itself, thus the true <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">mater rerum</span></span>, from the obscurity
          of whose womb all phenomena and forms come forth, to fall back into
          it some time again; from this, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          from matter fully comprehended and exhaustively known, a world
          might have been constructed of which materialism would not need to
          be ashamed. Quite true: only the trick would then consist in this,
          that the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Quæsita</span></span> had
          been placed in the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Data</span></span>,
          for professedly what was taken as given, and made the
          starting-point of the deduction, was mere matter, but really it
          included all the mysterious forces of nature which cling to it, or
          more correctly, by means of it become visible to us, much the same
          as if <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page064">[pg 064]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg064"></a> under the name of
          the dish we understand what lies upon it. For in fact, for our
          knowledge, matter is really merely the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">vehicle</span></em>
          of the qualities and natural forces, which appear as its accidents,
          and just because I have traced these back to the will I call matter
          the mere <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">visibility of the will</span></em>. Stripped
          of all these qualities, matter remains behind as that which is
          without qualities, the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">caput
          mortuum</span></span> of nature, out of which nothing can honestly
          be made. If, on the contrary, in the manner referred to, one leaves
          it all these properties, one is guilty of a concealed <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">petitio principii</span></span>, for one has
          assumed the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Quæsita</span></span>
          beforehand as <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Data</span></span>. But what
          is accomplished with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em> will no longer be a proper
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">materialism</span></em>, but merely <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">naturalism</span></em>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          an absolute system of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">physics</span></em>, which, as was shown in
          chap. 17 already referred to, can never assume and fill the place
          of metaphysics, just because it only begins after so many
          assumptions, thus never undertakes to explain things from the
          foundation. Mere naturalism is therefore essentially based simply
          upon <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">qualitates
          occultæ</span></span>, which one can never get beyond except, as I
          have done, by calling in the aid of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">subjective</span></em> source of knowledge,
          which then certainly leads to the long and toilsome round-about
          path of metaphysics, for it presupposes the complete analysis of
          self-consciousness and of the intellect and will given in it.
          However, the starting from what is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">objective</span></em>, at the foundation of
          which lies <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">external perception</span></em>, so distinct
          and comprehensible, is a path so natural and which presents itself
          of its own accord to man, that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">naturalism</span></em>,
          and consequently, because this cannot satisfy as it is not
          exhaustive, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">materialism</span></em>, are systems to which
          the speculative reason must necessarily have come, nay, must have
          come first of all. Therefore at the very beginning of the history
          of philosophy we meet naturalism, in the systems of the Ionic
          philosophers, and then materialism in the teaching of Leucippus and
          Democritus, and also later we see them ever appear anew from time
          to time.</p>

<span style="font-size: 144%">Chapter XXV. Transcendent
          Considerations Concerning The Will As Thing In Itself.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Even the merely
          empirical consideration of nature recognises a constant transition
          from the simplest and most necessary manifestation of a universal
          force of nature up to the life and consciousness of man himself,
          through gentle gradations, and with only relative, and for the most
          part fluctuating, limits. Reflection, following this view, and
          penetrating somewhat more deeply into it, will soon be led to the
          conviction that in all these phenomena, the inner nature, that
          which manifests itself, that which appears, is one and the same,
          which comes forth ever more distinctly; and accordingly that what
          exhibits itself in a million forms of infinite diversity, and so
          carries on the most varied and the strangest play without beginning
          or end, this is one being which is so closely disguised behind all
          these masks that it does not even recognise itself, and therefore
          often treats itself roughly. Thus the great doctrine of the ἑν και
          παν early appeared both in the east and in the west, and, in spite
          of all contradiction, has asserted itself, or at least constantly
          revived. We, however, have now entered even deeper into the secret,
          since by what has already been said we have been led to the insight
          that when in any phenomenon a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">knowing consciousness</span></em> is added to
          that inner being which lies at the foundation of all phenomena, a
          consciousness which when directed inwardly becomes <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">self-consciousness</span></em>, then that
          inner being presents itself to this self-consciousness as that
          which is so familiar and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page066">[pg
          066]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg066"></a>
          so mysterious, and is denoted by the word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em>.
          Accordingly we have called that universal fundamental nature of all
          phenomena <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the will</span></em>, after that manifestation
          in which it unveils itself to us most fully; and by this word
          nothing is further from our intention than to denote an unknown
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">x</span></span>; but, on the contrary, we
          denote that which at least on one side is infinitely better known
          and more intimate than anything else.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Let us now call
          to mind a truth, the fullest and most thorough proof of which will
          be found in my prize essay on the freedom of the will—the truth
          that on account of the absolutely universal validity of the law of
          causality, the conduct or the action of all existences in this
          world is always strictly <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">necessitated</span></em> by the causes which
          in each case call it forth. And in this respect it makes no
          difference whether such an action has been occasioned by causes in
          the strictest sense of the word, or by stimuli, or finally by
          motives, for these differences refer only to the grade of the
          susceptibility of the different kinds of existences. On this point
          we must entertain no illusion: the law of causality knows no
          exception; but everything, from the movement of a mote in a sunbeam
          to the most deeply considered action of man, is subject to it with
          equal strictness. Therefore, in the whole course of the world,
          neither could a mote in a sunbeam describe any other line in its
          flight than it has described, nor a man act any other way than he
          has acted; and no truth is more certain than this, that all that
          happens, be it small or great, happens with absolute <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">necessity</span></em>. Consequently, at every
          given moment of time, the whole condition of all things is firmly
          and accurately determined by the condition which has just preceded
          it, and so is it with the stream of time back to infinity and on to
          infinity. Thus the course of the world is like that of a clock
          after it has been put together and wound up; thus from this
          incontestable point of view it is a mere machine, the aim of which
          we cannot see. Even if, quite without justification, nay, at
          bottom, in spite of all conceivability <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page067">[pg 067]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg067"></a> and its conformity to law, one should assume
          a first beginning, nothing would thereby be essentially changed.
          For the arbitrarily assumed first condition of things would at its
          origin have irrevocably determined and fixed, both as a whole and
          down to the smallest detail, the state immediately following it;
          this state, again, would have determined the one succeeding it, and
          so on <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">per secula
          seculorum</span></span>, for the chain of causality, with its
          absolute strictness—this brazen bond of necessity and
          fate—introduces every phenomenon irrevocably and unalterably, just
          as it is. The difference merely amounts to this, that in the case
          of the one assumption we would have before us a piece of clockwork
          which had once been wound up, but in the case of the other a
          perpetual motion; the necessity of the course, on the other hand,
          would remain the same. In the prize essay already referred to I
          have irrefutably proved that the action of man can make no
          exception here, for I showed how it constantly proceeds with strict
          necessity from two factors—his character and the motives which come
          to him. The character is inborn and unalterable; the motives are
          introduced with necessity under the guidance of causality by the
          strictly determined course of the world.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Accordingly
          then, from one point of view, which we certainly cannot abandon,
          because it is established by the objective laws of the world, which
          are <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span> valid,
          the world, with all that is in it, appears as an aimless, and
          therefore incomprehensible, play of an eternal necessity, an
          inscrutable and inexorable Αναγκη. Now, what is objectionable, nay,
          revolting, in this inevitable and irrefutable view of the world
          cannot be thoroughly done away with by any assumption except this,
          that as in one aspect every being in the world is a phenomenon, and
          necessarily determined by the laws of the phenomenon, in another
          aspect it is in itself <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em>, and indeed absolutely
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">free
          will</span></em>, for necessity only arises through the forms which
          belong entirely to the phenomenon, through the principle of
          sufficient reason <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page068">[pg
          068]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg068"></a>
          in its different modes. Such a will, then, must be self-dependent,
          for, as free, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, as a thing in itself, and
          therefore not subject to the principle of sufficient reason, it
          cannot depend upon another in its being and nature any more than in
          its conduct and action. By this assumption alone will as much
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">freedom</span></em> be supposed as is needed
          to counterbalance the inevitable strict <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">necessity</span></em> which governs the course
          of the world. Accordingly one has really only the choice either of
          seeing that the world is a mere machine which runs on of necessity,
          or of recognising a free will as its inner being whose
          manifestation is not directly the action but primarily the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">existence
          and nature</span></em> of things. This freedom is therefore
          transcendental, and consists with empirical necessity, in the same
          way as the transcendental ideality of phenomena consists with their
          empirical reality. That only under this assumption the action of a
          man, in spite of the necessity with which it proceeds from his
          character and the motives, is yet <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">his own</span></em>
          I have shown in my prize essay on the freedom of the will; with
          this, however, self-dependency is attributed to his nature. The
          same relation holds good of all things in the world. The strictest
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">necessity</span></em>, carried out honestly
          with rigid consistency, and the most perfect <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">freedom</span></em>, rising to omnipotence,
          had to appear at once and together in philosophy; but, without
          doing violence to truth, this could only take place by placing the
          whole <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">necessity</span></em> in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">acting and
          doing</span></em> (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Operari</span></span>), and the whole
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">freedom</span></em> in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">being and
          nature</span></em> (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Esse</span></span>).
          Thereby a riddle is solved which is as old as the world, simply
          because it has hitherto always been held upside down and the
          freedom persistently sought in the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Operari</span></span>, the necessity in the
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Esse</span></span>. I, on the contrary, say:
          Every being without exception <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">acts</span></em> with strict necessity, but it
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">exists</span></em> and is what it is by virtue
          of its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">freedom</span></em>. Thus with me freedom and
          necessity are to be met with neither more nor less than in any
          earlier system; although now one and now the other must be
          conspicuous according as one takes offence that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em> is
          attributed to processes <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page069">[pg
          069]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg069"></a>
          of nature which hitherto were explained from necessity, or that the
          same strict necessity is recognised in motivation as in mechanical
          causality. The two have merely changed places: freedom has been
          transferred to the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Esse</span></span>,
          and necessity limited to the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Operari</span></span>.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In short,
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Determinism</span></em> stands firm. For
          fifteen hundred years men have wearied themselves in vain to shake
          it, influenced by certain crotchets, which are well known, but dare
          scarcely yet be called by their name. Yet in accordance with it the
          world becomes a mere puppet-show, drawn by wires (motives), without
          it being even possible to understand for whose amusement. If the
          piece has a plan, then fate is the director; if it has none, then
          blind necessity. There is no other deliverance from this absurdity
          than the knowledge that the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">being and nature</span></em> of all things is
          the manifestation of a really <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">free will</span></em>, which knows itself in
          them; for their <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">doing and acting</span></em> cannot be
          delivered from necessity. To save freedom from fate and chance, it
          had to be transferred from the action to the existence.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As now necessity
          only affects the phenomenon, not the thing in itself, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          the true nature of the world, so also does <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">multiplicity</span></em>. This is sufficiently
          explained in § 25 of the first volume. I have only to add here one
          remark in confirmation and illustration of this truth.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Every one knows
          only <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> being quite immediately—his
          own will in self-consciousness. Everything else he knows only
          indirectly, and then judges it by analogy with this; a process
          which he carries further in proportion to the grade of his
          reflective powers. Even this ultimately springs from the fact that
          there really is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">only one being</span></em>; the illusion of
          multiplicity (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Maja</span></span>), which proceeds from the
          forms of external, objective comprehension, could not penetrate to
          inner, simple consciousness; therefore this always finds before it
          only one being.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If we consider
          the perfection of the works of nature, which can never be
          sufficiently admired, and which even <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page070">[pg 070]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg070"></a> in the lowest and smallest organisms, for
          example, in the fertilising parts of plants or in the internal
          construction of insects, is carried out with as infinite care and
          unwearied labour as if each work of nature had been its only one,
          upon which it was therefore able to expend all its art and power;
          if we yet find this repeated an infinite number of times in each
          one of innumerable individuals of every kind, and not less
          carefully worked out in that one whose dwelling-place is the most
          lonely, neglected spot, to which, till then, no eye had penetrated;
          if we now follow the combination of the parts of every organism as
          far as we can, and yet never come upon one part which is quite
          simple, and therefore ultimate, not to speak of one which is
          inorganic; if, finally, we lose ourselves in calculating the design
          of all those parts of the organism for the maintenance of the whole
          by virtue of which every living thing is complete in and for
          itself; if we consider at the same time that each of these
          masterpieces, itself of short duration, has already been produced
          anew an innumerable number of times, and yet every example of a
          species, every insect, every flower, every leaf, still appears just
          as carefully perfected as was the first of its kind; thus that
          nature by no means wearies and begins to bungle, but, with equally
          patient master-hand, perfects the last like the first: then we
          become conscious, first of all, that all human art is completely
          different, not merely in degree, but in kind, from the works of
          nature; and, next, that the working force, the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">natura naturans</span></span>, in each of its
          innumerable works, in the least as in the greatest, in the last as
          in the first, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is immediately present whole and
          undivided</span></em>, from which it follows that, as such and in
          itself, it knows nothing of space and time. If we further reflect
          that the production of these hyperboles of all works of art costs
          nature absolutely nothing, so that, with inconceivable prodigality,
          she creates millions of organisms which never attain to maturity,
          and without sparing exposes every living thing to a thousand
          accidents, yet, on the other <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page071">[pg 071]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg071"></a> hand, if favoured by chance or directed by
          human purpose, readily affords millions of examples of a species of
          which hitherto there was only one, so that millions cost her no
          more than one; this also leads us to see that the multiplicity of
          things has its root in the nature of the knowledge of the subject,
          but is foreign to the thing in itself, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          to the inner primary force which shows itself in things; that
          consequently space and time, upon which the possibility of all
          multiplicity depends, are mere forms of our perception; nay, that
          even that whole inconceivable ingenuity of structure associated
          with the reckless prodigality of the works upon which it has been
          expended ultimately springs simply from the way in which things are
          apprehended by us; for when the simple and indivisible original
          effort of the will exhibits itself as object in our cerebral
          knowledge, it must appear as an ingenious combination of separate
          parts, as means and ends of each other, accomplished with wonderful
          completeness.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unity of that
          will</span></em>, here referred to, which lies beyond the
          phenomenon, and in which we have recognised the inner nature of the
          phenomenal world, is a metaphysical unity, and consequently
          transcends the knowledge of it, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          does not depend upon the functions of our intellect, and therefore
          can not really be comprehended by it. Hence it arises that it opens
          to the consideration an abyss so profound that it admits of no
          thoroughly clear and systematically connected insight, but grants
          us only isolated glances, which enable us to recognise this unity
          in this and that relation of things, now in the subjective, now in
          the objective sphere, whereby, however, new problems are again
          raised, all of which I will not engage to solve, but rather appeal
          here to the words <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">est quadam prodire
          tenus</span></span>, more concerned to set up nothing false or
          arbitrarily invented than to give a thorough account of all;—at the
          risk of giving here only a fragmentary exposition.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If we call up to
          our minds and distinctly go through in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page072">[pg 072]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg072"></a> thought the exceedingly acute theory of the
          origin of the planetary system, first put forth by Kant and later
          by Laplace, a theory of which it is scarcely possible to doubt the
          correctness, we see the lowest, crudest, and blindest forces of
          nature bound to the most rigid conformity to law, by means of their
          conflict for one and the same given matter, and the accidental
          results brought about by this produce the framework of the world,
          thus of the designedly prepared future dwelling-place of
          innumerable living beings, as a system of order and harmony, at
          which we are the more astonished the more distinctly and accurately
          we come to understand it. For example, if we see that every planet,
          with its present velocity, can only maintain itself exactly where
          it actually has its place, because if it were brought nearer to the
          sun it would necessarily fall into it, or if placed further from it
          would necessarily fly away from it; how, conversely, if we take the
          place as given, it can only remain there with its present velocity
          and no other, because if it went faster it would necessarily fly
          away from the sun, and if it went slower it would necessarily fall
          into it; that thus only one definite place is suitable to each
          definite velocity of a planet; and if we now see this solved by the
          fact that the same physical, necessary, and blindly acting cause
          which appointed it its place, at the same time and just by doing
          so, imparted to it exactly the only velocity suitable for this
          place, in consequence of the law of nature that a revolving body
          increases its velocity in proportion as its revolution becomes
          smaller; and, moreover, if finally we understand how endless
          permanence is assured to the whole system, by the fact that all the
          mutual disturbances of the course of the planets which unavoidably
          enter, must adjust themselves in time; how then it is just the
          irrationality of the periods of revolution of Jupiter and Saturn to
          each other that prevents their respective perturbations from
          repeating themselves at one place, whereby they would become
          dangerous, and brings it about that, appearing <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page073">[pg 073]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg073"></a> seldom and always at a different place,
          they must sublate themselves again, like dissonances in music which
          are again resolved into harmony. By means of such considerations we
          recognise a design and perfection, such as could only have been
          brought about by the freest absolute will directed by the most
          penetrating understanding and the most acute calculation. And yet,
          under the guidance of that cosmogony of Laplace, so well thought
          out and so accurately calculated, we cannot prevent ourselves from
          seeing that perfectly blind forces of nature, acting according to
          unalterable natural laws, through their conflict and aimless play
          among themselves, could produce nothing else but this very
          framework of the world, which is equal to the work of an
          extraordinarily enhanced power of combination. Instead now, after
          the manner of Anaxagoras, of dragging in the aid of an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intelligence</span></em> known to us only from
          animal nature, and adapted only to its aims, an intelligence which,
          coming from without, cunningly made use of the existing forces of
          nature and their laws in order to carry out its ends, which are
          foreign to these,—we recognise in these lowest forces of nature
          themselves that same, one will, which indeed first manifests itself
          in them, and already in this manifestation striving after its goal,
          through its original laws themselves works towards its final end,
          to which therefore all that happens according to blind laws of
          nature must minister and correspond. And this indeed cannot be
          otherwise, because everything material is nothing but just the
          phenomenal appearance, the visibility, the objectivity of the will
          to live which is one. Thus even the lowest forces of nature
          themselves are animated by that same will, which afterwards, in the
          individual beings provided with intelligence, marvels at its own
          work, as the somnambulist wonders in the morning at what he has
          done in his sleep; or, more accurately, which is astonished at its
          own form which it beholds in the mirror. This unity which is here
          proved of the accidental with the intentional, of the necessary
          with the free, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page074">[pg
          074]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg074"></a>
          on account of which the blindest chances, which, however, rest upon
          universal laws of nature, are as it were the keys upon which the
          world-spirit plays its melodies so full of significance,—this
          unity, I say, is, as has already been remarked, an abyss in the
          investigation into which even philosophy can throw no full light,
          but only a glimmer.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But I now turn
          to a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">subjective</span></em> consideration belonging
          to this place, to which, however, I am able to give still less
          distinctness than to the objective consideration which has just
          been set forth; for I shall only be able to express it by images
          and similes. Why is our consciousness brighter and more distinct
          the further it extends towards without, so that its greatest
          clearness lies in sense perception, which already half belongs to
          things outside us,—and, on the other hand, grows dimmer as we go
          in, and leads, if followed to its inmost recesses, to a darkness in
          which all knowledge ceases? Because, I say, consciousness
          presupposes <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">individuality</span></em>; but this belongs to
          the mere phenomenon, for it is conditioned by the forms of the
          phenomenon, space and time, as multiplicity of the similar. Our
          inner nature, on the other hand, has its root in that which is no
          longer phenomenon, but thing in itself, to which, therefore, the
          forms of the phenomenon do not extend; and thus the chief
          conditions of individuality are wanting, and with these the
          distinctness of consciousness falls off. In this root of existence
          the difference of beings ceases, like that of the radii of a sphere
          in the centre; and as in the sphere the surface is produced by the
          radii ending and breaking off, so consciousness is only possible
          where the true inner being runs out into the phenomenon, through
          whose forms the separate individuality becomes possible upon which
          consciousness depends, which is just on that account confined to
          phenomena. Therefore all that is distinct and thoroughly
          comprehensible in our consciousness always lies without upon this
          surface of the sphere. Whenever, on the contrary, we withdraw
          entirely from this, consciousness <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page075">[pg 075]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg075"></a> forsakes us,—in sleep, in death, to a certain
          extent also in magnetic or magic influences; for these all lead
          through the centre. But just because distinct consciousness, being
          confined to the surface of the sphere, is not directed towards the
          centre, it recognises other individuals certainly as of the same
          kind, but not as identical, which yet in themselves they are.
          Immortality of the individual might be compared to a point of the
          surface flying off at a tangent. But immortality, by virtue of the
          eternal nature of the inner being of the whole phenomenon, may be
          compared to the return of that point, on the radius, to the centre,
          of which the whole surface is just the extension. The will as the
          thing in itself is whole and undivided in every being, as the
          centre is an integral part of every radius; while the peripherical
          end of this radius is in the most rapid revolution, with the
          surface, which represents time and its content, the other end, at
          the centre, which represents eternity, remains in the profoundest
          peace, because the centre is the point of which the rising half is
          not different from the sinking. Therefore in the Bhagavad-gita it
          is said: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Haud distributum animantibus, et quasi
          distributum tamen insidens, animantiumque sustentaculum id
          cognoscendum, edax et rursus genitale</span></span>”</span> (Lect.
          13, 16 vers. Schlegel). Certainly we fall here into mystical and
          figurative language, but it is the only language in which anything
          can be said on this entirely transcendent theme. So this simile
          also may pass. The human race may be imagined as an <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">animal compositum</span></span>, a form of
          life of which many polypi, especially those which swim, such as
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Veretillum</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Funiculina</span></span>, and others, afford
          examples. As in these the head isolates each individual animal, and
          the lower part, with the common stomach, combines them all in the
          unity of one life process, so the brain with its consciousness
          isolates the human individual, while the unconscious part, the
          vegetative life with its ganglion system, into which in sleep the
          brain-consciousness disappears, like a lotus which nightly
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page076">[pg 076]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg076"></a> sinks in the flood,
          is a common life of all, by means of which in exceptional cases
          they can even communicate, as, for example, occurs when dreams
          communicate themselves directly, the thoughts of the mesmeriser
          pass into the somnambulist, and finally also in the magnetic or
          generally magical influence proceeding from intentional willing.
          Such an influence, if it occurs, is <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">toto genere</span></span> different from every
          other on account of the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">influxus
          physicus</span></span> which takes place, for it is really an
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">actio in distans</span></span> which the will,
          certainly proceeding from the individual, yet performs in its
          metaphysical quality as the omnipresent substratum of the whole of
          nature. One might also say that as in the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">generatio æquivoca</span></span> there
          sometimes and as an exception appears a weak residue of the
          original <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">creative power</span></em> of the will, which
          in the existing forms of nature has already done its work and is
          extinguished, so there may be, exceptionally, acting in these
          magical influences, as it were, a surplus of its original
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">omnipotence</span></em>, which completes its
          work and spends itself in the construction and maintenance of the
          organisms. I have spoken fully of this magical property of the will
          in <span class="tei tei-q">“The Will in Nature,”</span> and I
          gladly omit here discussions which have to appeal to uncertain
          facts, which yet cannot be altogether ignored or denied.</p>

<span style="font-size: 144%">On Teleology.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The universal
          teleology or design of organised nature relative to the continuance
          of every existing being, together with the adaptation of organised
          to unorganised nature, cannot without violence enter into the
          connection of any philosophical system except that one which makes
          a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em> the basis of the existence of
          every natural being; a will which accordingly expresses its nature
          and tendency not merely in the actions, but already in the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">form</span></em> of the phenomenal organism.
          In the preceding chapter I have merely indicated the account which
          our system of thought gives of this subject, since I have already
          expounded it in the passage of the first volume referred to below,
          and with special clearness and fulness in <span class="tei tei-q">“The Will in Nature,”</span> under the rubric
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Comparative Anatomy.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The astounding
          amazement which is wont to take possession of us when we consider
          the endless design displayed in the construction of organised
          beings ultimately rests upon the certainly natural but yet false
          assumption that that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">adaptation</span></em> of the parts to each
          other, to the whole of the organism and to its aims in the external
          world, as we comprehend it and judge of it by means of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">knowledge</span></em>, thus upon the path of
          the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">idea</span></em>, has also come into being
          upon the same path; thus that as it exists <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">for</span></em> the
          intellect, it was also brought about <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by</span></em> the
          intellect. We certainly can only bring about something <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page078">[pg 078]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg078"></a> regular and conforming to law, such,
          for example, as every crystal is, under the guidance of the law and
          the rule; and in the same way, we can only bring about something
          designed under the guidance of the conception of the end; but we
          are by no means justified in imputing this limitation of ours to
          nature, which is itself prior to all intellect, and whose action is
          entirely different in kind from ours, as was said in the preceding
          chapter. It accomplishes that which appears so designed and planned
          without reflection and without conception of an end, because
          without idea, which is of quite secondary origin. Let us first
          consider what is merely according to rule, not yet adapted to ends.
          The six equal radii of a snowflake, separating at equal angles, are
          measured beforehand by no knowledge; but it is the simple tendency
          of the original will, which so exhibits itself to knowledge when
          knowledge appears. As now here the will brings about the regular
          figure without mathematics, so also without physiology does it
          bring about the form which is organised and furnished with organs
          evidently adapted to special ends. The regular form in space only
          exists for the perception, the perceptive form of which is space;
          so the design of the organism only exists for the knowing reason,
          the reflection of which is bound to the conceptions of end and
          means. If direct insight into the working of nature was possible
          for us, we would necessarily recognise that the wonder excited by
          teleology referred to above is analogous to that which that savage
          referred to by Kant in his explanation of the ludicrous felt when
          he saw the froth irresistibly foaming out of a bottle of beer which
          had just been opened, and expressed his wonder not that it should
          come out, but that any one had ever been able to get it in; for we
          also assume that the teleology of natural productions has been put
          in the same as it comes out for us. Therefore our astonishment at
          design may likewise be compared to that which the first productions
          of the art of printing excited in those who considered them under
          the supposition that <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page079">[pg
          079]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg079"></a>
          they were works of the pen, and therefore had to resort to the
          assumption of the assistance of a devil in order to explain them.
          For, let it be said again, it is our intellect which by means of
          its own forms, space, time, and causality, apprehends as object the
          act of will, in itself metaphysical and indivisible, which exhibits
          itself in the phenomenon of an animal,—it is our intellect which
          first produces the multiplicity and diversity of the parts, and is
          then struck with amazement at their perfect agreement and
          conspiring together, which proceeds from the original unity;
          whereby then, in a certain sense, it marvels at its own work.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If we give
          ourselves up to the contemplation of the indescribably and
          infinitely ingenious construction of any animal, even if it were
          only the commonest insect, lose ourselves in admiration of it, and
          it now occurs to us that nature recklessly exposes even this
          exceedingly ingenious and highly complicated organism daily and by
          thousands to destruction by accident, animal rapacity, and human
          wantonness, this wild prodigality fills us with amazement; but our
          amazement is based upon an ambiguity of the conceptions, for we
          have in our minds the human work of art which is accomplished by
          the help of the intellect and by overcoming a foreign and resisting
          material, and therefore certainly costs much trouble. Nature's
          works, on the contrary, however ingenious they may be, cost her
          absolutely no trouble; for here the will to work is already the
          work itself, since, as has already been said, the organism is
          merely the visibility of the will which is here present, brought
          about in the brain.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In consequence
          of the nature of organised beings which has been set forth,
          teleology, as the assumption of the adaptation of every part to its
          end, is a perfectly safe guide in considering the whole of
          organised nature; on the other hand, in a metaphysical regard, for
          the explanation of nature beyond the possibility of experience, it
          must only be regarded as valid in a secondary and subsidiary manner
          for the confirmation of principles of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page080">[pg 080]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg080"></a> explanation which are otherwise established:
          for here it belongs to the problems which have to be given account
          of. Accordingly, if in some animal a part is found of which we do
          not see any use, we must never venture the conjecture that nature
          has produced it aimlessly, perhaps trifling, or out of mere
          caprice. Certainly it is possible to conceive something of this
          kind under the Anaxagorean assumption that the disposition of
          nature has been brought about by means of an ordering
          understanding, which, as such, obeys a foreign will; but not under
          the assumption that the true inner being (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          outside of our idea) of every organism is simply and solely
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">its own
          will</span></em>; for then the existence of every part is
          conditioned by the circumstance that in some way it serves the will
          which here lies at its foundation, expresses and realises some
          tendency of it, and consequently in some way contributes to the
          maintenance of this organism. For apart from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the will which
          manifests itself in it</span></em>, and the conditions of the
          external world under which this has voluntarily undertaken to live,
          for the conflict with which its whole form and disposition is
          already adapted, nothing can have influenced it and determined its
          form and parts, thus no arbitrary power, no caprice. On this
          account everything in it must be designed; and therefore final
          causes (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">causæ finales</span></span>)
          are the clue to the understanding of organised nature, as efficient
          causes (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">causæ
          efficientes</span></span>) are the clue to the understanding of
          unorganised nature. It depends upon this, that if in anatomy or
          zoology, we cannot find the end or aim of an existing part, our
          understanding receives a shock similar to that which it receives in
          physics from an effect whose cause remains concealed; and as we
          assume the latter as necessary, so also we assume the former, and
          therefore go on searching for it, however long we may already have
          done so in vain. This is, for example, the case with the spleen, as
          to the use of which men never cease inventing hypotheses, till some
          day one shall have proved itself correct. So is it also with the
          large spiral-formed teeth <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page081">[pg
          081]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg081"></a>
          of the babyroussa, the horn-shaped excrescences of certain
          caterpillars, and more of the like. Negative cases are also judged
          by us according to the same rule; for example, that in a class
          which, as a whole, is so uniform as that of lizards, so important a
          part as the bladder is present in many species, while it is wanting
          in others; similarly that dolphins and certain cetacea related to
          them are entirely without olfactory nerves, while the rest of the
          cetacea and even fishes have them: there must be a reason which
          determines this.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Individual real
          exceptions to this universal law of design in organised nature have
          indeed been discovered, and with great surprise; but in these cases
          that <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">exceptio firmat
          regulam</span></span> applies, since they can be accounted for upon
          other grounds. Such, for example, is the fact that the tadpoles of
          the pipa toad have tails and gills, although, unlike all other
          tadpoles, they do not swim, but await their metamorphosis on the
          back of the mother; that the male kangaroo has the marsupial bones
          which in the female carry the pouch; that male mammals have
          breasts; that the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Mus typhlus</span></span>, a
          rat, has eyes, although very small ones, without any opening for
          them in the outer skin, which thus covers them, clothed with hair;
          and that the moles of the Apennines, and also two
          fishes—<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Murena cœcilia</span></span>
          and <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Gastrobrauchus
          cœcus</span></span>—are in the same case; of like kind is the
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Proteus anguinus</span></span>. These rare and
          surprising exceptions to the rule of nature, which is otherwise so
          rigid, these contradictions with itself into which it falls, we
          must explain from the inner connection which the different kinds of
          phenomena have with each other, by virtue of the unity of that
          which manifests itself in them, and in consequence of which nature
          must hint at some thing in one, simply because another of the same
          type actually has it. Accordingly the male animal has a rudimentary
          form of an organ which is actually present in the female. As now
          here the difference of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sex</span></em> cannot abolish the type of the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">species</span></em>, so also the type of a
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page082">[pg 082]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg082"></a> whole order—for
          example, of the batrachia—asserts itself even where in one
          particular species (pipa) one of its determinations is superfluous.
          Still less can nature allow a determination (eyes) which belongs to
          the type of a whole division (Vertebrata) to vanish entirely
          without a trace, even if it is wanting in some particular species
          (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Mus typhlus</span></span>) as superfluous; but
          here also it must at least indicate in a rudimentary manner what it
          carries out in all the others.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Even from this
          point of view it is to some extent possible to see upon what
          depends that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">homology</span></em> in the skeleton primarily
          of mammals, and in a wider sense of all vertebrates, which has been
          so fully explained, especially by Richard Owen in his <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ostéologie comparée</span></span>,”</span> and
          on account of which, for example, all mammals have seven cervical
          vertebræ, every bone of the human hand and arm finds its analogue
          in the fin of the whale, the skull of the bird in the egg has
          exactly as many bones as that of the human fœtus, &amp;c. All this
          points to a principle which is independent of teleology, but which
          is yet the foundation upon which teleology builds, or the already
          given material for its works, and just that which Geoffroy St.
          Hilaire has explained as the <span class="tei tei-q">“anatomical
          element.”</span> It is the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">unité de
          plan</span></span>, the fundamental type of the higher animal
          world, as it were the arbitrarily chosen key upon which nature here
          plays.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Aristotle has
          already correctly defined the difference between the efficient
          cause (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">causa
          efficiens</span></span>) and the final cause (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">causa finalis</span></span>) in these words:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Δυο τροποι της αιτιας, το οὑ ἑνεκα και το
          εξ αναγκης, και δει λεγοντας τυγχανειν μαλιστα μεν αμφοιν.”</span>
          (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Duo sunt causæ modi: alter cujus gratia, et
          alter e necessitate; ac potissimum utrumque eruere
          oportet.</span></span>) <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De part. anim.</span></span>, i. 1. The
          efficient cause is that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">whereby</span></em> something is, the final
          cause that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">on account of which</span></em> it is; the
          phenomenon to be explained has, in time, the former <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">behind</span></em>
          it, and the latter <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">before</span></em> it. Only in the case of the
          voluntary actions of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page083">[pg
          083]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg083"></a>
          animal beings do the two directly unite, for here the final cause,
          the end, appears as the motive; a motive, however, is always the
          true and proper <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cause</span></em> of the action, is wholly and
          solely its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">efficient</span></em> cause, the change
          preceding it which calls it forth, by virtue of which it
          necessarily appears, and without which it could not happen; as I
          have shown in my prize essay upon freedom. For whatever of a
          physiological nature one might wish to insert between the act of
          will and the corporeal movement, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em>
          always remains here confessedly that which moves, and what moves
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">it</span></em> is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">motive</span></em>
          coming from without, thus the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">causa finalis</span></span>; which
          consequently appears here as <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">causa efficiens</span></span>. Besides, we
          know from what has gone before that the bodily movement is one with
          the act of will, for it is merely its phenomenal appearance in
          cerebral perception. This union of the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">causa finalis</span></span> with the efficient
          cause in the one phenomenon <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intimately</span></em> known to us, which
          accordingly remains throughout our typical phenomenon, is certainly
          to be firmly retained; for it leads precisely to the conclusion
          that at least in organised nature, the knowledge of which has
          throughout final causes for its clue, a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em> is
          the forming power. In fact, we cannot otherwise distinctly think a
          final cause except as an end in view, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, a
          motive. Indeed, if we carefully consider the final causes in nature
          in order to express their transcendent nature, we must not shrink
          from a contradiction, and boldly say: the final cause is a motive
          which acts upon a being, by which it is not known. For certainly
          the termite nests are the motive which has produced the toothless
          muzzle of the ant-bear, and also its long extensile, glutinous
          tongue: the hard egg-shell which holds the chicken imprisoned is
          certainly the motive for the horny point with which its beak is
          provided in order to break through that shell, after which it
          throws it off as of no further use. And in the same way the laws of
          the reflection and refraction of light are the motive for the
          wonderfully ingenious and complex optical instrument, the human
          eye, which has the transparency <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page084">[pg 084]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg084"></a> of its cornea, the different density of its
          three humours, the form of its lens, the blackness of its choroid,
          the sensitiveness of its retina, the contracting power of its
          pupil, and its muscular system, accurately calculated according to
          those laws. But those motives acted before they were apprehended;
          it is not otherwise, however contradictory it may sound. For here
          is the transition of the physical into the metaphysical. But the
          latter we have already recognised in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em>;
          therefore we must see that the will which extends an elephant's
          trunk towards an object is the same will which has also called it
          forth and formed it, anticipating objects.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is in
          conformity with this that in the investigation of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">organised</span></em> nature we are entirely
          referred to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">final causes</span></em>, everywhere seek for
          these and explain everything from them. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">efficient
          causes</span></em>, on the contrary, here assume only a quite
          subordinate position as the mere tools of the final causes, and,
          just as in the case of the voluntary movement of the limbs, which
          is confessedly effected by external motives, they are rather
          assumed than pointed out. In explaining the physiological
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">functions</span></em> we certainly look about
          for the efficient causes, though for the most part in vain; but in
          explaining the origin of the parts we again look for them no more,
          but are satisfied with the final causes alone. At the most we have
          here some such general principle as that the larger the part is to
          be the stronger must be the artery that conducts blood to it; but
          of the actually efficient causes which bring about, for example,
          the eye, the ear, the brain, we know absolutely nothing. Indeed,
          even in explaining the mere functions the final cause is far more
          important and more to the point than the efficient; therefore, if
          the former alone is known we are instructed and satisfied with
          regard to the principal matter, while, on the other hand, the
          efficient cause alone helps us little. For example, if we really
          knew the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">efficient cause</span></em> of the circulation
          of the blood, as we do not, but still seek it, this would help us
          little unless <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page085">[pg
          085]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg085"></a>
          we knew the final cause, that the blood must go into the lungs for
          the purpose of oxidation, and again flow back for the purpose of
          nourishing; but by the knowledge of this, even without the
          knowledge of the efficient cause, we have gained much light.
          Moreover, I am of opinion, as was said above, that the circulation
          of the blood has no properly efficient cause, but that the will is
          here as immediately active as in muscular movement where motives
          determine it by means of nerve conduction, so that here also the
          movement is called forth directly by the final cause; thus by the
          need of oxidation in the lungs, which here to a certain extent acts
          as a motive upon the blood, yet so that the mediation of knowledge
          is in this case wanting, because everything takes place in the
          interior of the organism. The so-called metamorphosis of plants, a
          thought lightly thrown out by Kaspar Wolf, which, under this
          hyperbolic title, Goethe pompously and with solemn delivery
          expounds as his own production, belongs to the class of
          explanations of organic nature from the efficient cause; although
          ultimately he only says that nature does not in the case of every
          production begin from the beginning and create out of nothing, but
          as it were, writing on in the same style, adds on to what already
          exists, makes use of the earlier forms, developed, and raised to
          higher power, to carry its work further: just as it has done in the
          ascending series of animals entirely in accordance with the law:
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Natura non facit saltus, et quod commodissimum
          in omnibus suis operationibus sequitur</span></span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Arist. de incessu
          animalium, c. 2 et 8</span></span>). Indeed, to explain the blossom
          by pointing out in all its parts the form of the leaf seems to me
          almost the same as explaining the structure of a house by showing
          that all its parts, storeys, balconies, and garrets, are only
          composed of bricks and mere repetitions of the original unity of
          the brick. And not much better, though much more problematical,
          seems to me the explanation of the skull from vertebræ, although
          even here also it is a matter of course that the covering or case
          of the brain <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page086">[pg
          086]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg086"></a>
          will not be absolutely different and entirely disparate from that
          of the spinal cord, of which it is the continuation and terminal
          knob, but will rather be a carrying out of the same kind of thing.
          This whole method of consideration belongs to the Homology of
          Richard Owen referred to above. On the other hand, it seems to me
          that the following explanation of the nature of the flower from its
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">final
          cause</span></em>, suggested by an Italian whose name has escaped
          me, is a far more satisfactory account to give. The end of the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">corolla</span></em> is—(1.) Protection of the
          pistil and the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">stamina</span></em>; (2.) by means of it the
          purified saps are prepared, which are concentrated in the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pollen</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">germs</span></em>;
          (3.) from the glands of its base the essential oil distils which,
          for the most part as a fragrant vapour, surrounding the anthers and
          pistil, protects them to a certain extent from the influence of the
          damp air. It is also one of the advantages of final causes that
          every <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">efficient</span></em> cause always ultimately
          rests upon something that cannot be fathomed, a force of nature,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, a <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">qualitas occulta</span></span>, and,
          therefore, it can only give a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">relative</span></em> explanation; while the
          final cause within its sphere affords a sufficient and perfect
          explanation. It is true we are only perfectly content when we know
          both the efficient cause, also called by Aristotle ἡ αιτια εξ
          αναγκης, and the final cause, ἡ χαριν του βελτιονος, at once and
          yet separately, as their concurrence, their wonderful working
          together, then surprises us, and on account of it the best appears
          as the absolutely necessary, and the necessary again as if it were
          merely the best and not necessary; for then arises in us the dim
          perception that both causes, however different may be their origin,
          are yet connected in the root, in the nature of the thing in
          itself. But such a twofold knowledge is seldom attainable; in
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">organised</span></em> nature, because the
          efficient cause is seldom known to us; in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unorganised</span></em> nature, because the
          final cause remains problematical. However, I will illustrate this
          by a couple of examples as good as I find within the range of my
          physiological knowledge, for <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page087">[pg 087]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg087"></a> which physiologists may be able to substitute
          clearer and more striking ones. The louse of the negro is black.
          Final cause: its own safety. Efficient cause: because its
          nourishment is the black <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">rete Malpighi</span></span> of the negro. The
          multifarious, brilliant, and gay colouring of the plumage of
          tropical birds is explained, although only very generally, from the
          strong effect of the light in the tropics, as its efficient cause.
          As the final cause I would assign that those brilliant feathers are
          the gorgeous uniform in which the individuals of the innumerable
          species there, often belonging to the same genus, may recognise
          each other; so that each male may find his female. The same holds
          good of butterflies of different zones and latitudes. It has been
          observed that consumptive women, in the last stage of their
          illness, readily become pregnant, that the disease stops during
          pregnancy, but after delivery appears again worse than before, and
          now generally results in death: similarly that consumptive men
          generally beget another child in the last days of their life. The
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">final
          cause</span></em> here is that nature, always so anxiously
          concerned for the maintenance of the species, seeks to replace by a
          new individual the approaching loss of one in the prime of life;
          the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">efficient cause</span></em>, on the other
          hand, is the unusually excited state of the nervous system which
          occurs in the last period of consumption. From the same final cause
          is to be explained the analogous phenomenon that (according to
          Oken, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Die
          Zeugung</span></span>, p. 65) flies poisoned with arsenic still
          couple, and die in the act of copulation. The final cause of the
          pubes in both sexes, and of the Mons Veneris in the female, is that
          even in the case of very thin subjects the Ossa pubis shall not be
          felt, which might excite antipathy; the efficient cause, on the
          other hand, is to be sought in the fact that wherever the mucous
          membrane passes over to the outer skin, hair grows in the vicinity;
          and, secondly, also that the head and the genitals are to a certain
          extent opposite poles of each other, and therefore have various
          relations and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page088">[pg
          088]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg088"></a>
          analogies between them, among which is that of being covered with
          hair. The same efficient cause holds good also of the beard of the
          man; the final cause of it, I suppose, lies in the fact that the
          pathogonomic signs, thus the rapid alterations of the countenance
          betraying every movement of the mind, are principally visible in
          the mouth and its vicinity; therefore, in order to conceal these
          from the prying eye of the adversary, as something dangerous in
          bargaining, or in sudden emergencies, nature gave man the beard
          (which shows that <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">homo homini
          lupus</span></span>). The woman, on the other hand, could dispense
          with this; for with her dissimulation and command of countenance
          are inborn. As I have said, there must be far more apt examples to
          be found to show how the completely blind working of nature unites
          in the result with the apparently intentional, or, as Kant calls
          it, the mechanism of nature with its technic; which points to the
          fact that both have their common origin beyond their difference in
          the will as the thing in itself. Much would be achieved for the
          elucidation of this point of view, if, for example, we could find
          the efficient cause which carries the driftwood to the treeless
          polar lands, or that which has concentrated the dry land of our
          planet principally in the northern half of it; while it is to be
          regarded as the final cause of this that the winter of that half,
          because it occurs in the perihelion which accelerates the course of
          the earth, is eight days shorter, and hereby is also milder. Yet in
          considering <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unorganised</span></em> nature the final cause
          is always ambiguous, and, especially when the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">efficient</span></em> cause is found, leaves
          us in doubt whether it is not a merely subjective view, an aspect
          conditioned by our point of view. In this respect, however, it may
          be compared to many works of art; for example, to coarse mosaics,
          theatre decorations, and to the god Apennine at Pratolino, near
          Florence, composed of large masses of rock, all of which only
          produce their effect at a distance, and vanish when we come near,
          because instead of them the efficient cause of their appearance
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page089">[pg 089]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg089"></a> now becomes visible:
          but the forms are yet actually existent, and are no mere
          imagination. Analogous to this, then, are the final causes in
          unorganised nature, if the efficient causes appear. Indeed, those
          who take a wide view of things would perhaps allow it to pass if I
          added that something similar is the case with omens.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For the rest, if
          any one desires to misuse the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">external</span></em> design, which, as has
          been said, always remains ambiguous for physico-theological
          demonstrations, which is done even at the present day, though it is
          to be hoped only by Englishmen, there are in this class enough
          examples <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">in contrarium</span></span>,
          thus ateleological instances, to derange his conception. One of the
          strongest is presented by the unsuitableness of sea-water for
          drinking, in consequence of which man is never more exposed to the
          danger of dying of thirst than in the midst of the greatest mass of
          water on his planet. <span class="tei tei-q">“Why, then, does the
          sea need to be salt?”</span> let us ask our Englishman.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That in
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unorganised</span></em> nature the final
          causes entirely withdraw into the background, so that an
          explanation from them alone is here no longer valid, but the
          efficient causes are rather indispensably required, depends upon
          the fact that the will which objectifies itself here also no longer
          appears in individuals which constitute a whole for themselves, but
          in forces of nature and their action, whereby end and means are too
          far separated for their relation to be clear and for us to
          recognise a manifestation of will in it. This already occurs in
          organised nature, in a certain degree, when the design is an
          external one, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the end lies in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em>
          individual and the means in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">another</span></em>. Yet even here it remains
          unquestionable so long as the two belong to the same species,
          indeed it then becomes the more striking. Here we have first to
          count the reciprocally adapted organisation of the genitals of the
          two sexes, and then also many circumstances that assist the
          propagation of the species, for example, in the case of the
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Lampyris noctiluca</span></span> (the
          glowworm) the circumstance <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page090">[pg 090]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg090"></a> that only the male, which does not shine, has
          wings to enable it to seek out the female; the wingless female, on
          the other hand, since it only comes out in the evening, possesses
          the phosphorescent light, so that the male may be able to find it.
          Yet in the case of the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Lampyris
          Italica</span></span> both sexes shine, which is an instance of the
          natural luxury of the South. But a striking, because quite special,
          example of the kind of design we are speaking of is afforded by the
          discovery made by Geoffroy St. Hilaire, in his last years, of the
          more exact nature of the sucking apparatus of the cetacea. Since
          all sucking requires the action of respiration, it can only take
          place in the respirable medium itself, and not under water, where,
          however, the sucking young of the whale hangs on to the teats of
          the mother; now to meet this the whole mammary apparatus of the
          cetacea is so modified that it has become an injecting organ, and
          placed in the mouth of the young injects the milk into it without
          it requiring to suck. When, on the contrary, the individual that
          affords essential help to another belongs to an entirely different
          species, and even to another kingdom of nature, we will doubt this
          external design just as in unorganised nature; unless it is evident
          that the maintenance of the species depends upon it. But this is
          the case with many plants whose fructification only takes place by
          means of insects, which either bear the pollen to the stigma or
          bend the stamina to the pistil. The common barberry, many kinds of
          iris, and <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Aristolochia
          Clematitis</span></span> cannot fructify themselves at all without
          the help of insects (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Chr. Cour.</span></span> Sprengel,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Entdecktes Geheimniss, &amp;c.</span></span>,
          1793; Wildenow, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Grundriss der Kräuterkunde</span></span>,
          353). Very many diœcia, monœcia, and polygamia are in the same
          position. The reciprocal support which the plant and the insect
          worlds receive from each other will be found admirably described in
          Burdach's large Physiology, vol. i. § 263. He very beautifully
          adds: <span class="tei tei-q">“This is no mechanical assistance, no
          make-shift, as if nature had made the plants yesterday,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page091">[pg 091]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg091"></a> and had committed an
          error which she tries to correct to-day through the insect; it is
          rather a deep-lying sympathy between the plant and the animal
          worlds. It ought to reveal the identity of the two. Both, children
          of one mother, ought to subsist with each other and through each
          other.”</span> And further on: <span class="tei tei-q">“But the
          organised world stands in such a sympathy with the unorganised
          world also,”</span> &amp;c. A proof of this <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">consensus naturæ</span></span> is also
          afforded by the observation communicated in the second volume of
          the <span class="tei tei-q">“Introduction into Entomology”</span>
          by Kirby and Spence, that the insect eggs that pass the winter
          attached to the twigs of the trees, which serve as nourishment for
          their larvæ, are hatched exactly at the time at which the twig
          buds; thus, for example, the aphis of the birch a month earlier
          than that of the ash. Similarly, that the insects of perennial
          plants pass the winter upon these as eggs; but those of mere
          annuals, since they cannot do this, in the state of pupæ.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Three great men
          have entirely rejected teleology, or the explanation from final
          causes, and many small men have echoed them. These three are,
          Lucretius, Bacon of Verulam, and Spinoza. But in the case of all
          three we know clearly enough the source of this aversion, namely,
          that they regarded it as inseparable from speculative theology, of
          which, however, they entertained so great a distrust (which Bacon
          indeed prudently sought to conceal) that they wanted to give it a
          wide berth. We find Leibnitz also entirely involved in this
          prejudice, for, with characteristic naïveté, he expresses it as
          something self-evident in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lettre à M. Nicaise</span></span>
          (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Spinozæ
          op. ed Paulus</span></span>, vol. ii. p. 672): <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">Les causes finales, ou ce qui
          est la même chose, la consideration de la sagesse divine dans
          l'ordre des choses.</span></span>”</span> (The devil also
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">même chose</span></span>!) At the same point
          of view we find, indeed, Englishmen even at the present day. The
          Bridgewater-Treatise-men—Lord Brougham, &amp;c.—nay, even Richard
          Owen also, in his <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ostéologie
          Comparée</span></span>,”</span> thinks precisely as Leibnitz, which
          I have already found <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page092">[pg
          092]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg092"></a>
          fault with in the first volume. To all these teleology is at once
          also theology, and at every instance of design recognised in
          nature, instead of thinking and learning to understand nature, they
          break at once into the childish cry, <span class="tei tei-q">“Design! design!”</span> then strike up the refrain of
          their old wives' philosophy, and stop their ears against all
          rational arguments, such as, however, the great Hume has already
          advanced against them.<a href="#note_5" id="noteref_5" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">5</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The ignorance of
          the Kantian philosophy now, after seventy years, which is really a
          disgrace to Englishmen of learning, is principally responsible for
          this whole outcast position of the English; and this ignorance,
          again, depends, at least in great measure, upon the nefarious
          influence of the detestable English clergy, with whom
          stultification of every kind is a thing after their own hearts, so
          that only they may be able still to hold the English nation,
          otherwise so intelligent, involved in the most degrading bigotry;
          therefore, inspired by the basest obscurantism, they oppose with
          all their might the education of the people, the investigation of
          nature, nay, the advancement of all human knowledge in general; and
          both by means of their connections and by means of their
          scandalous, unwarrantable wealth, which increases the misery of the
          people, they extend their influence even to university teachers and
          authors, who accordingly (for example, Th. Brown, <span class="tei tei-q">“On Cause and Effect”</span>) resort to suppressions
          and perversions of every kind simply in order to avoid opposing
          even in a distant manner that <span class="tei tei-q">“cold
          superstition”</span> (as Pückler very happily designates their
          religion, or the current arguments in its favour).</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page093">[pg 093]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg093"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But, on the
          other hand, the three great men of whom we are speaking, since they
          lived long before the dawn of the Kantian philosophy, are to be
          pardoned for their distrust of teleology on account of its origin;
          yet even Voltaire regarded the physico-theological proof as
          irrefutable. In order, however, to go into this somewhat more
          fully: first of all, the polemic of Lucretius (iv. 824-858) against
          teleology is so crude and clumsy that it refutes itself and
          convinces us of the opposite. But as regards Bacon (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De augm.
          scient.</span></span>, iii. 4), he makes, in the first place, no
          distinction with reference to the use of final causes between
          organised and unorganised nature (which is yet just the principal
          matter), for, in his examples of final causes, he mixes the two up
          together. Then he banishes final causes from physics to
          metaphysics; but the latter is for him, as it is still for many at
          the present day, identical with speculative theology. From this,
          then, he regards final causes as inseparable, and goes so far in
          this respect that he blames Aristotle because he has made great use
          of final causes, yet without connecting them with speculative
          theology (which I shall have occasion immediately especially to
          praise). Finally, Spinoza (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Eth.</span></span> i. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">prop.</span></span>
          36, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">appendix</span></span>) makes it abundantly
          clear that he identifies teleology so entirely with
          physico-theology, against which he expresses himself with
          bitterness, that he explains <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Natura nihil frustra agere</span></span>:
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">hoc est, quod in usum hominum non
          sit</span></span>: similarly, <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Omnia naturalia tanquam ad suum utile media
          considerant, et credunt aliquem alium esse, qui illa media
          paraverit</span></span>; and also: <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Hinc statuerunt, Deos omnia in usum hominum
          fecisse et dirigere</span></span>. Upon this, then, he bases his
          assertion: <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Naturam finem nullum sibi
          præfixum habere et omnes causas finales nihil, nisi humana esse
          figmenta</span></span>. His aim merely was to block the path of
          theism; and he had quite rightly recognised the physico-theological
          proof as its strongest weapon. But it was reserved for Kant really
          to refute this proof, and for me to give the correct exposition of
          its material, whereby <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page094">[pg
          094]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg094"></a> I
          have satisfied the maxim: <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Est enim verum index
          sui et falsi</span></span>. But Spinoza did not know how else to
          help himself but by the desperate stroke of denying teleology
          itself, thus design in the works of nature—an assertion the
          monstrosity of which is at once evident to every one who has gained
          any accurate knowledge of organised nature. This limited point of
          view of Spinoza, together with his complete ignorance of nature,
          sufficiently prove his entire incompetence in this matter, and the
          folly of those who, upon his authority, believe they must judge
          contemptuously of final causes.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Aristotle, who
          just here shows his brilliant side, contrasts very advantageously
          with these modern philosophers. He goes unprejudiced to nature,
          knows of no physico-theology—such a thing has never entered his
          mind,—and he has never looked at the world for the purpose of
          seeing whether it was a bungled piece of work. He is in his heart
          pure from all this, for he also sets up hypotheses as to the origin
          of animals and men (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De generat. anim.</span></span>, iii. 11)
          without lighting upon the physico-theological train of thought. He
          always says: <span class="tei tei-q">“ἡ φυσις ποιει (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">natura facit</span></span>), never ἡ φυσις
          πεποιηται”</span> (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">natura facta
          est</span></span>). But after he has truly and diligently studied
          nature, he finds that it everywhere proceeds teleologically, and he
          says: <span class="tei tei-q">“ματην ὁρωμεν ουδεν ποιουσαν την
          φυσιν”</span> (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">naturam nihil frustra facere

          books, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De

          <span class="tei tei-q">“Ουδε περιεργον ουδεν, ουτε ματην ἡ φυσις

          end of the books <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De generatione animalium</span></span>, and
          blames Democritus for having denied it, which is just what Bacon,
          in his prejudice, praises in him. Especially, however, in the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Physica,”</span> ii. 8, p. 198, Aristotle
          speaks <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ex professo</span></span> of
          final causes, and establishes them as the true principle of the
          investigation of nature. In fact, every good and regular mind must,
          in considering organised nature, hit upon teleology, but unless it
          is determined by the preconceived opinions, by no means either upon
          physico-theology or upon the anthropo-teleology condemned by
          Spinoza. With regard to Aristotle generally, I wish further to draw
          attention to the fact here, that his teaching, so far as it
          concerns <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unorganised</span></em> nature, is very
          defective and unserviceable, as in the fundamental conceptions of
          mechanics and physics he accepts the most gross errors, which is
          the less pardonable, since before him the Pythagoreans and
          Empedocles had been upon the right path and had taught much better.
          Empedocles indeed, as we learn from Aristotle's second book,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De
          cœlo</span></span> (c. 1, p. 284), had already grasped the
          conception of a tangential force arising from rotation, and
          counteracting gravity, which Aristotle again rejects. Quite the
          reverse, however, is Aristotle's relation to the investigation of
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">organised</span></em> nature. This is his
          field; here the wealth of his knowledge, the keenness of his
          observation, nay, sometimes the depth of his insight, astonish us.
          Thus, to give just one example, he already knew the antagonism in
          which in the ruminants the horns and the teeth of the upper jaw
          stand to each other, on account of which, therefore, the latter are
          wanting where the former are found, and conversely (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De partib.
          anim.</span></span>, iii. 2). Hence then, also his correct
          estimation of final causes.</p>

<span style="font-size: 144%">Chapter XXVII. On Instinct And
          Mechanical Tendency.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is as if
          nature had wished, in the mechanical tendencies of animals, to give
          the investigator an illustrative commentary upon her works,
          according to final causes and the admirable design of her organised
          productions which is thereby introduced. For these mechanical
          tendencies show most clearly that creatures can work with the
          greatest decision and definiteness towards an end which they do not
          know, nay, of which they have no idea. Such, for instance, is the
          bird's nest, the spider's web, the ant-lion's pitfall, the
          ingenious bee-hive, the marvellous termite dwelling, &amp;c., at
          least for those individual animals that carry them out for the
          first time; for neither the form of the perfected work nor the use
          of it can be known to them. Precisely so, however, does <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">organising</span></em> nature work; and
          therefore in the preceding chapter I gave the paradoxical
          explanation of the final cause, that it is a motive which acts
          without being known. And as in working from mechanical tendency
          that which is active is evidently and confessedly the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em>,
          so is it also really the will which is active in the working of
          organising nature.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One might say,
          the will of animal creatures is set in motion in two different
          ways: either by motivation or by instinct; thus from without, or
          from within; by an external occasion, or by an internal tendency;
          the former is explicable because it lies before us without, the
          latter is inexplicable because it is merely internal. But, more
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page097">[pg 097]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg097"></a> closely considered,
          the contrast between the two is not so sharp, indeed ultimately it
          runs back into a difference of degree. The motive also only acts
          under the assumption of an inner tendency, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, a
          definite quality of will which is called its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">character</span></em>. The motive in each case
          only gives to this a definite direction—individualises it for the
          concrete case. So also instinct, although a definite tendency of
          the will, does not act entirely, like a spring, from within; but it
          also waits for some external circumstance necessarily demanded for
          its action, which at least determines the time of its
          manifestation; such is, for the migrating bird, the season of the
          year; for the bird that builds its nest, the fact of pregnancy and
          the presence of the material for the nest; for the bee it is, for
          the beginning of the structure, the basket or the hollow tree, and
          for the following work many individually appearing circumstances;
          for the spider, it is a well-adapted corner; for the caterpillar,
          the suitable leaf; for egg-laying insects, the for the most part
          very specially determined and often rare place, where the hatched
          larvæ will at once find their nourishment, and so on. It follows
          from this that in works of mechanical tendency it is primarily the
          instinct of these animals that is active, yet subordinated also to
          their intellect. The instinct gives the universal, the rule; the
          intellect the particular, the application, in that it directs the
          detail of the execution, in which therefore the work of these
          animals clearly adapts itself to the circumstances of the existing
          case. According to all this, the difference between instinct and
          mere character is to be fixed thus: Instinct is a character which
          is only set in motion by a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">quite specially determined</span></em> motive,
          and on this account the action that proceeds from it is always
          exactly of the same kind; while the character which is possessed by
          every species of animal and every individual man is certainly a
          permanent and unalterable quality of will, which can yet be set in
          motion by very different motives, and adapts itself to these; and
          on account of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page098">[pg
          098]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg098"></a>
          this the action proceeding from it may, according to its material
          quality, be very different, but yet will always bear the stamp of
          the same character, and will therefore express and reveal this; so
          that for the knowledge of this character the material quality of
          the action in which it appears is essentially a matter of
          indifference. Accordingly we might explain instinct as a character
          which is beyond all measure one-sided and strictly determined. It
          follows from this exposition that being determined by mere
          motivation presupposes a certain width of the sphere of knowledge,
          and consequently a more fully developed intellect: therefore it is
          peculiar to the higher animals, quite pre-eminently, however, to
          man; while being determined by instinct only demands as much
          intellect as is necessary to apprehend the one quite specially
          determined motive, which alone and exclusively becomes the occasion
          for the manifestation of the instinct. Therefore it is found in the
          case of an exceedingly limited sphere of knowledge, and
          consequently, as a rule, and in the highest degree, only in animals
          of the lower classes, especially insects. Since, accordingly, the
          actions of these animals only require an exceedingly simple and
          small motivation from without, the medium of this, thus the
          intellect or the brain, is very slightly developed in them, and
          their outward actions are for the most part under the same guidance
          as the inner, follow upon mere stimuli, physiological functions,
          thus the ganglion system. This is, then, in their case excessively
          developed; their principal nerve-stem runs under the belly in the
          form of two cords, which at every limb of the body form a ganglion
          little inferior to the brain in size, and, according to Cuvier,
          this nerve-stem is an analogue not so much of the spinal cord as of
          the great sympathetic nerve. According to all this, instinct and
          action through mere motivation, stand in a certain antagonism, in
          consequence of which the former has its maximum in insects, and the
          latter in man, and the actuation of other animals lies between the
          two in manifold <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page099">[pg
          099]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg099"></a>
          gradations according as in each the cerebral or the ganglion system
          is preponderatingly developed. Just because the instinctive action
          and the ingenious contrivances of insects are principally directed
          from the ganglion system, if we regard them as proceeding from the
          brain alone, and wish to explain them accordingly, we fall into
          absurdities, because we then apply a false key. The same
          circumstance, however, imparts to their action a remarkable
          likeness to that of somnambulists, which indeed is also explained
          as arising from the fact that, instead of the brain, the
          sympathetic nerve has undertaken the conduct of the outward actions
          also; insects are accordingly, to a certain extent, natural
          somnambulists. Things which we cannot get at directly we must make
          comprehensible to ourselves by means of an analogy. What has just
          been referred to will accomplish this in a high degree when
          assisted by the fact that in Kieser's <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tellurismus</span></span>”</span> (vol. ii. p.
          250) a case is mentioned <span class="tei tei-q">“in which the
          command of the mesmerist to the somnambulist to perform a definite
          action in a waking state was carried out by him when he awoke,
          without remembering the command.”</span> Thus it was as if he must
          perform that action without rightly knowing why. Certainly this has
          the greatest resemblance to what goes on in the case of mechanical
          instincts in insects. The young spider feels that it must spin its
          web, although it neither knows nor understands the aim of it. We
          are also reminded here of the dæmon of Socrates, on account of
          which he had the feeling that he must leave undone some action
          expected of him, or lying near him, without knowing why—for his
          prophetic dream about it was forgotten. We have in our own day
          quite well-authenticated cases analogous to this; therefore I only
          briefly call these to mind. One had taken his passage on a ship,
          but when it was about to sail he positively would not go on board
          without being conscious of a reason;—the ship went down. Another
          goes with companions to a powder magazine; when he <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page100">[pg 100]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg100"></a> has arrived in its vicinity he
          absolutely will not go any further, but turns hastily back, seized
          with anxiety he knows not why;—the magazine blows up. A third upon
          the ocean feels moved one night, without any reason, not to
          undress, but lays himself on the bed in his clothes and boots, and
          even with his spectacles on;—in the night the ship goes on fire,
          and he is among the few who save themselves in the boat. All this
          depends upon the dull after-effect of forgotten fatidical dreams,
          and gives us the key to an analogous understanding of instinct and
          mechanical tendencies.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the other
          hand, as has been said, the mechanical tendencies of insects
          reflect much light upon the working of the unconscious will in the
          inner functions of the organism and in its construction. For
          without any difficulty we can see in the ant-hill or the beehive
          the picture of an organism explained and brought to the light of
          knowledge. In this sense Burdach says (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Physiologie</span></span>, vol. ii. p. 22):
          <span class="tei tei-q">“The formation and depositing of the eggs
          is the part of the queen-bee, and the care for the cultivation of
          them falls to the workers; thus in the former the ovary, and in the
          latter the uterus, is individualised.”</span> In the insect
          society, as in the animal organism, the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">vita propria</span></span> of each part is
          subordinated to the life of the whole, and the care for the whole
          precedes that for particular existence; indeed the latter is only
          conditionally willed, the former unconditionally; therefore the
          individuals are even sacrificed occasionally for the whole, as we
          allow a limb to be taken off in order to save the whole body. Thus,
          for example, if the path is closed by water against the march of
          the ants, those in front boldly throw themselves in until their
          corpses are heaped up into a dam for those that follow. When the
          drones have become useless they are stung to death. Two queens in
          the hive are surrounded, and must fight with each other till one of
          them loses its life. The ant-mother bites its own wings off after
          it has been impregnated, for they would only be a hindrance
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page101">[pg 101]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg101"></a> to it in the work
          that is before it of tending the new family it is about to found
          under the earth (Kirby and Spence, vol. i.) As the liver will do
          nothing more than secrete gall for the service of the digestion,
          nay, will only itself exist for this end—and so with every other
          part—the working bees also will do nothing more than collect honey,
          secrete wax, and make cells for the brood of the queen; the drones
          nothing more than impregnate; the queen nothing but deposit eggs;
          thus all the parts work only for the maintenance of the whole which
          alone is the unconditional end, just like the parts of the
          organism. The difference is merely that in the organism the will
          acts perfectly blindly in its primary condition; in the insect
          society, on the other hand, the thing goes on already in the light
          of knowledge, to which, however, a decided co-operation and
          individual choice is only left in the accidents of detail, where it
          gives assistance and adopts what has to be carried out to the
          circumstances. But the insects will the end as a whole without
          knowing it; just like organised nature working according to final
          causes; even the choice of the means is not as a whole left to
          their knowledge, but only the more detailed disposition of them.
          Just on this account, however, their action is by no means
          automatic, which becomes most distinctly visible if one opposes
          obstacles to their action. For example, the caterpillar spins
          itself in leaves without knowing the end; but if we destroy the web
          it skilfully repairs it. Bees adapt their hive at the first to the
          existing circumstances, and subsequent misfortunes, such as
          intentional destruction, they meet in the way most suitable to the
          special case (Kirby and Spence, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Introduc. to
          Entomol.</span></span>; Huber, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Des
          abeilles</span></span>). Such things excite our astonishment,
          because the apprehension of the circumstances and the adaptation to
          these is clearly a matter of knowledge; while we believe them
          capable once for all of the most ingenious preparation for the
          coming race and the distant future, well knowing that in this they
          are not guided by knowledge, for a forethought of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page102">[pg 102]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg102"></a> that kind proceeding from knowledge
          demands an activity of the brain rising to the level of reason. On
          the other hand, the intellect even of the lower animals is
          sufficient for the modifying and arranging of the particular case
          according to the existing or appearing circumstances; because,
          guided by instinct, it has only to fill up the gaps which this
          leaves. Thus we see ants carry off their larvæ whenever the place
          is too damp, and bring them back again when it becomes dry. They do
          not know the aim of this, thus are not guided in it by knowledge;
          but the choice of the time at which the place is no longer suitable
          for the larvæ, and also of the place to which they now bring them,
          is left to their knowledge. I wish here also to mention a fact
          which some one related to me verbally from his own experience,
          though I have since found that Burdach quotes it from Gleditsch.
          The latter, in order to test the burying-beetle (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Necrophorus vespillo</span></span>), had tied
          a dead frog lying upon the ground to a string, the upper end of
          which was fastened to a stick stuck obliquely in the ground. Now
          after several burying-beetles had, according to their custom,
          undermined the frog, it could not, as they expected, sink into the
          ground; after much perplexed running hither and thither they
          undermined the stick also. To this assistance rendered to instinct,
          and that repairing of the works of mechanical tendency, we find in
          the organism the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">healing power</span></em> of nature analogous,
          which not only heals wounds, replacing even bone and nerve
          substance, but, if through the injury of a vein or nerve branch a
          connection is interrupted, opens a new connection by means of
          enlargement of other veins or nerves, nay, perhaps even by
          producing new branches; which further makes some other part or
          function take the place of a diseased part or function; in the case
          of the loss of an eye sharpens the other, or in the case of the
          loss of one of the senses sharpens all the rest; which even
          sometimes closes an intestinal wound, in itself fatal, by the
          adhesion of the mesentery or the peritoneum; in short, seeks to
          meet every <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page103">[pg
          103]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg103"></a>
          injury and every disturbance in the most ingenious manner. If, on
          the other hand, the injury is quite incurable, it hastens to
          expedite death, and indeed the more so the higher is the species of
          the organism, thus the greater its sensibility. Even this has its
          analogue in the instinct of insects. The wasps, for instance, who
          through the whole summer have with great care and labour fed their
          larvæ on the produce of their plundering, but now, in October, see
          the last generation of them facing starvation, sting them to death
          (Kirby and Spence, vol. i. p. 374). Nay, still more curious and
          special analogies may be found; for example, this: if the female
          humble-bee (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Apis terrestris,
          bombylius</span></span>) lays eggs, the working humble-bees are
          seized with a desire to devour them, which lasts from six to eight
          hours and is satisfied unless the mother keeps them off and
          carefully guards the eggs. But after this time the working
          humble-bees show absolutely no inclination to eat the eggs even
          when offered to them; on the contrary, they now become the zealous
          tenders and nourishers of the larvæ now being hatched out. This may
          without violence be taken as an analogue of children's complaints,
          especially teething, in which it is just the future nourishers of
          the organism making an attack upon it which so often costs it its
          life. The consideration of all these analogies between organised
          life and the instinct, together with the mechanical tendencies of
          the lower animals, serves ever more to confirm the conviction that
          the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em> is the basis of the one as of
          the other, for it shows here also the subordinate rôle of knowledge
          in the action of the will, sometimes more, sometimes less,
          confined, and sometimes wanting altogether.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But in yet
          another respect instincts and the animal organisation reciprocally
          illustrate each other: through the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">anticipation of the
          future</span></em> which appears in both. By means of instincts and
          mechanical tendencies animals care for the satisfaction of wants
          which they do not yet feel, nay, not only for their own wants, but
          even for those <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page104">[pg
          104]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg104"></a>
          of the future brood. Thus they work for an end which is as yet
          unknown to them. This goes so far, as I have illustrated by the
          example of the Bombex in <span class="tei tei-q">“The Will in
          Nature”</span> (second edit. p. 45, third edit. p. 47), that they
          pursue and kill in advance the enemies of their future eggs. In the
          same way we see the future wants of an animal, its prospective
          ends, anticipated in its whole corporisation by the organised
          implements for their attainment and satisfaction; from which, then,
          proceeds that perfect adaptation of the structure of every animal
          to its manner of life, that equipment of it with the needful
          weapons to attack its prey and to ward off its enemies, and that
          calculation of its whole form with reference to the element and the
          surroundings in which it has to appear as a pursuer, which I have
          fully described in my work on the will in nature under the rubric
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Comparative Anatomy.”</span> All these
          anticipations, both in the instinct and in the organisation of
          animals, we might bring under the conception of a knowledge
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span>, if <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">knowledge</span></em> lay at their foundation
          at all. But this is, as we have shown, not the case. Their source
          lies deeper than the sphere of knowledge, in the will as the thing
          in itself, which as such remains free even from the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">forms</span></em>
          of knowledge; therefore with reference to it time has no
          significance, consequently the future lies as near it as the
          present.</p>

<span style="font-size: 144%">Characterisation Of The Will To
          Live.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Our second book
          closed with the question as to the goal and aim of that will which
          had shown itself to be the inner nature of all things in the world.
          The following remarks may serve to supplement the answer to this
          question given there in general terms, for they lay down the
          character of the will as a whole.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such a
          characterisation is possible because we have recognised as the
          inner nature of the world something thoroughly real and empirically
          given. On the other hand, the very name <span class="tei tei-q">“world-soul,”</span> by which many have denoted that
          inner being, gives instead of this a mere <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ens rationis</span></span>; for <span class="tei tei-q">“soul”</span> signifies an individual unity of
          consciousness which clearly does not belong to that nature, and in
          general, since the conception <span class="tei tei-q">“soul”</span>
          supposes knowing and willing in inseparable connection and yet
          independent of the animal organism, it is not to be justified, and
          therefore not to be used. The word should never be applied except
          in a metaphorical sense, for it is much more insidious than ψυχη or
          anima, which signify breath.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Much more
          unsuitable, however, is the way in which so-called pantheists
          express themselves, whose whole philosophy consists chiefly in
          this, that they call the inner nature of the world, which is
          unknown to them, <span class="tei tei-q">“God;”</span> by which
          indeed they imagine they have achieved much. According to this,
          then, the world would be a theophany. But let one only look at it:
          this world of constantly needy <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page106">[pg 106]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg106"></a> creatures, who continue for a time only by
          devouring one another, fulfil their existence in anxiety and want,
          and often suffer terrible miseries, till at last they fall into the
          arms of death; whoever distinctly looks upon this will allow that
          Aristotle was right in saying: <span class="tei tei-q">“ἡ φυσις
          δαιομονια, αλλ᾽ ου θεια εστι”</span> (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Natura dæmonia est, non divina</span></span>),
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De
          divinat.</span></span>, c. 2, p. 463; nay, he will be obliged to
          confess that a God who could think of changing Himself into such a
          world as this must certainly have been tormented by the devil. I
          know well that the pretended philosophers of this century follow
          Spinoza in this, and think themselves thereby justified. But
          Spinoza had special reasons for thus naming his one substance, in
          order, namely, to preserve at least the word, although not the
          thing. The stake of Giordano Bruno and of Vanini was still fresh in
          the memory; they also had been sacrificed to that God for whose
          honour incomparably more human sacrifices have bled than on the
          altars of all heathen gods of both hemispheres together. If, then,
          Spinoza calls the world God, it is exactly the same thing as when
          Rousseau in the <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Contrat
          social</span></span>,”</span> constantly and throughout denotes the
          people by the word <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">le
          souverain</span></span>; we might also compare it with this, that
          once a prince who intended to abolish the nobility in his land, in
          order to rob no one of his own, hit upon the idea of ennobling all
          his subjects. Those philosophers of our day have certainly one
          other ground for the nomenclature we are speaking of, but it is no
          more substantial. In their philosophising they all start, not from
          the world or our consciousness of it, but from God, as something
          given and known; He is not their <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">quæsitum</span></span>, but their <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">datum</span></span>. If they were boys I would
          then explain to them that this is a <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">petitio principii</span></span>, but they know
          this as well as I do. But since Kant has shown that the path of the
          earlier dogmatism, which proceeded honestly, the path from the
          world to a God, does not lead there, these gentlemen now imagine
          they have found a fine way of escape and made it cunningly. Will
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page107">[pg 107]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg107"></a> the reader of a
          later age pardon me for detaining him with persons of whom he has
          never heard.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Every glance at
          the world, to explain which is the task of the philosopher,
          confirms and proves that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will to live</span></em>, far from being an
          arbitrary hypostasis or an empty word, is the only true expression
          of its inmost nature. Everything presses and strives towards
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">existence</span></em>, if possible <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">organised
          existence</span></em>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">life</span></em>,
          and after that to the highest possible grade of it. In animal
          nature it then becomes apparent that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will to
          live</span></em> is the keynote of its being, its one unchangeable
          and unconditioned quality. Let any one consider this universal
          desire for life, let him see the infinite willingness, facility,
          and exuberance with which the will to live presses impetuously into
          existence under a million forms everywhere and at every moment, by
          means of fructification and of germs, nay, when these are wanting,
          by means of <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">generatio
          æquivoca</span></span>, seizing every opportunity, eagerly grasping
          for itself every material capable of life: and then again let him
          cast a glance at its fearful alarm and wild rebellion when in any
          particular phenomenon it must pass out of existence; especially
          when this takes place with distinct consciousness. Then it is
          precisely the same as if in this single phenomenon the whole world
          would be annihilated for ever, and the whole being of this
          threatened living thing is at once transformed into the most
          desperate struggle against death and resistance to it. Look, for
          example, at the incredible anxiety of a man in danger of his life,
          the rapid and serious participation in this of every witness of it,
          and the boundless rejoicing at his deliverance. Look at the rigid
          terror with which a sentence of death is heard, the profound awe
          with which we regard the preparations for carrying it out, and the
          heartrending compassion which seizes us at the execution itself. We
          would then suppose there was something quite different in question
          than a few less years of an empty, sad existence, embittered by
          troubles of every kind, and always uncertain: <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page108">[pg 108]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg108"></a> we would rather be amazed that it was a
          matter of any consequence whether one attained a few years earlier
          to the place where after an ephemeral existence he has billions of
          years to be. In such phenomena, then, it becomes visible that I am
          right in declaring that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the will to live</span></em> is that which
          cannot be further explained, but lies at the foundation of all
          explanations, and that this, far from being an empty word, like the
          absolute, the infinite, the idea, and similar expressions, is the
          most real thing we know, nay, the kernel of reality itself.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But if now,
          abstracting for a while from this interpretation drawn from our
          inner being, we place ourselves as strangers over against nature,
          in order to comprehend it objectively, we find that from the grade
          of organised life upwards it has only one intention—that of the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">maintenance of the species</span></em>. To
          this end it works, through the immense superfluity of germs,
          through the urgent vehemence of the sexual instinct, through its
          willingness to adapt itself to all circumstances and opportunities,
          even to the production of bastards, and through the instinctive
          maternal affection, the strength of which is so great that in many
          kinds of animals it even outweighs self-love, so that the mother
          sacrifices her life in order to preserve that of the young. The
          individual, on the contrary, has for nature only an indirect value,
          only so far as it is the means of maintaining the species. Apart
          from this its existence is to nature a matter of indifference;
          indeed nature even leads it to destruction as soon as it has ceased
          to be useful for this end. Why the individual exists would thus be
          clear; but why does the species itself exist? That is a question
          which nature when considered merely objectively cannot answer. For
          in vain do we seek by contemplating her for an end of this restless
          striving, this ceaseless pressing into existence, this anxious care
          for the maintenance of the species. The strength and time of the
          individuals are consumed in the effort to procure sustenance for
          themselves and their young, and are only just sufficient, sometimes
          even <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page109">[pg 109]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg109"></a> not sufficient, for
          this. Even if here and there a surplus of strength, and therefore
          of comfort—in the case of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> rational species also of
          knowledge—remains, this is much too insignificant to pass for the
          end of that whole process of nature. The whole thing, when regarded
          thus purely objectively, and indeed as extraneous to us, looks as
          if nature was only concerned that of all her (Platonic) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ideas</span></em>,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, permanent forms, none
          should be lost. Accordingly, as if she had so thoroughly satisfied
          herself with the fortunate discovery and combination of these Ideas
          (for which the three preceding occasions on which she stocked the
          earth's surface with animals were only the preparation), that now
          her only fear is lest any one of these beautiful fancies should be
          lost, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, lest any one of these
          forms should disappear from time and the causal series. For the
          individuals are fleeting as the water in the brook; the Ideas, on
          the contrary, are permanent, like its eddies: but the exhaustion of
          the water would also do away with the eddies. We would have to stop
          at this unintelligible view if nature were known to us only from
          without, thus were given us merely <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">objectively</span></em>, and we accepted it as
          it is comprehended by knowledge, and also as sprung from knowledge,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, in the sphere of the idea,
          and were therefore obliged to confine ourselves to this province in
          solving it. But the case is otherwise, and a glance at any rate is
          afforded us into the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">interior of nature</span></em>; inasmuch as
          this is nothing else than <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">our own inner being</span></em>, which is
          precisely where nature, arrived at the highest grade to which its
          striving could work itself up, is now by the light of knowledge
          found directly in self-consciousness. Here the will shows itself to
          us as something <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">toto genere</span></span>
          different from the idea, in which nature appears unfolded in all
          her (Platonic) Ideas; and it now gives us, at one stroke, the
          explanation which could never be found upon the objective path of
          the idea. Thus the subjective here gives the key for the exposition
          of the objective. In order to recognise, as something original and
          unconditioned, that exceedingly strong <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page110">[pg 110]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg110"></a> tendency of all animals and men to retain
          life and carry it on as long as possible—a tendency which was set
          forth above as characteristic of the subjective, or of the will—it
          is necessary to make clear to ourselves that this is by no means
          the result of any objective <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">knowledge</span></em> of the worth of life,
          but is independent of all knowledge; or, in other words, that those
          beings exhibit themselves, not as drawn from in front, but as
          impelled from behind.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If with this
          intention we first of all review the interminable series of
          animals, consider the infinite variety of their forms, as they
          exhibit themselves always differently modified according to their
          element and manner of life, and also ponder the inimitable
          ingenuity of their structure and mechanism, which is carried out
          with equal perfection in every individual; and finally, if we take
          into consideration the incredible expenditure of strength,
          dexterity, prudence, and activity which every animal has
          ceaselessly to make through its whole life; if, approaching the
          matter more closely, we contemplate the untiring diligence of
          wretched little ants, the marvellous and ingenious industry of the
          bees, or observe how a single burying-beetle (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Necrophorus vespillo</span></span>) buries a
          mole of forty times its own size in two days in order to deposit
          its eggs in it and insure nourishment for the future brood
          (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gleditsch, Physik. Bot. Œkon.
          Abhandl.</span></span>, iii. 220), at the same time calling to mind
          how the life of most insects is nothing but ceaseless labour to
          prepare food and an abode for the future brood which will arise
          from their eggs, and which then, after they have consumed the food
          and passed through the chrysalis state, enter upon life merely to
          begin again from the beginning the same labour; then also how, like
          this, the life of the birds is for the most part taken up with
          their distant and laborious migrations, then with the building of
          their nests and the collecting of food for the brood, which itself
          has to play the same rôle the following year; and so all work
          constantly for the future, which afterwards makes bankrupt;—then we
          cannot avoid looking round for the reward <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page111">[pg 111]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg111"></a> of all this skill and trouble, for the end
          which these animals have before their eyes, which strive so
          ceaselessly—in short, we are driven to ask: What is the result?
          what is attained by the animal existence which demands such
          infinite preparation? And there is nothing to point to but the
          satisfaction of hunger and the sexual instinct, or in any case a
          little momentary comfort, as it falls to the lot of each animal
          individual, now and then in the intervals of its endless need and
          struggle. If we place the two together, the indescribable ingenuity
          of the preparations, the enormous abundance of the means, and the
          insufficiency of what is thereby aimed at and attained, the insight
          presses itself upon us that life is a business, the proceeds of
          which are very far from covering the cost of it. This becomes most
          evident in some animals of a specially simple manner of life. Take,
          for example, the mole, that unwearied worker. To dig with all its
          might with its enormous shovel claws is the occupation of its whole
          life; constant night surrounds it; its embryo eyes only make it
          avoid the light. It alone is truly an <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">animal nocturnum</span></span>; not cats,
          owls, and bats, who see by night. But what, now, does it attain by
          this life, full of trouble and devoid of pleasure? Food and the
          begetting of its kind; thus only the means of carrying on and
          beginning anew the same doleful course in new individuals. In such
          examples it becomes clear that there is no proportion between the
          cares and troubles of life and the results or gain of it. The
          consciousness of the world of perception gives a certain appearance
          of objective worth of existence to the life of those animals which
          can see, although in their case this consciousness is entirely
          subjective and limited to the influence of motives upon them. But
          the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">blind</span></em> mole, with its perfect
          organisation and ceaseless activity, limited to the alternation of
          insect larvæ and hunger, makes the disproportion of the means to
          the end apparent. In this respect the consideration of the animal
          world left to itself in lands uninhabited by men is also specially
          instructive. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page112">[pg
          112]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg112"></a> A
          beautiful picture of this, and of the suffering which nature
          prepares for herself without the interference of man, is given by
          Humboldt in his <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ansichten der
          Natur</span></span>”</span> (second edition, p. 30 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">et
          seq.</span></span>); nor does he neglect to cast a glance (p. 44)
          at the analogous suffering of the human race, always and everywhere
          at variance with itself. Yet in the simple and easily surveyed life
          of the brutes the emptiness and vanity of the struggle of the whole
          phenomenon is more easily grasped. The variety of the
          organisations, the ingenuity of the means, whereby each is adapted
          to its element and its prey contrasts here distinctly with the want
          of any lasting final aim; instead of which there presents itself
          only momentary comfort, fleeting pleasure conditioned by wants,
          much and long suffering, constant strife, <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">bellum omnium</span></span>, each one both a
          hunter and hunted, pressure, want, need, and anxiety, shrieking and
          howling; and this goes on <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">in secula
          seculorum</span></span>, or till once again the crust of the planet
          breaks. Yunghahn relates that he saw in Java a plain far as the eye
          could reach entirely covered with skeletons, and took it for a
          battlefield; they were, however, merely the skeletons of large
          turtles, five feet long and three feet broad, and the same height,
          which come this way out of the sea in order to lay their eggs, and
          are then attacked by wild dogs (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Canis rutilans</span></span>), who with their
          united strength lay them on their backs, strip off their lower
          armour, that is, the small shell of the stomach, and so devour them
          alive. But often then a tiger pounces upon the dogs. Now all this
          misery repeats itself thousands and thousands of times, year out,
          year in. For this, then, these turtles are born. For whose guilt
          must they suffer this torment? Wherefore the whole scene of horror?
          To this the only answer is: it is thus that the will to live
          objectifies itself.<a href="#note_7" id="noteref_7" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">7</span></span></a> Let one
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page113">[pg 113]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg113"></a> consider it well and
          comprehend it in all its objectifications; and then one will arrive
          at an understanding of its nature and of the world; but not if one
          frames general conceptions and builds card houses out of them. The
          comprehension of the great drama of the objectification of
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page114">[pg 114]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg114"></a> the will to live,
          and the characterisation of its nature, certainly demands somewhat
          more accurate consideration and greater thoroughness than the
          dismissal of the world by attributing to it the title of God, or,
          with a silliness which only the German fatherland offers and knows
          how to enjoy, explaining it as the <span class="tei tei-q">“Idea in
          its other being,”</span> in which for twenty years the simpletons
          of my time have found their unutterable delight. Certainly,
          according to pantheism or Spinozism, of which the systems of our
          century are mere travesties, all that sort of thing reels itself
          off actually without end, straight on through all eternity. For
          then the world is a God, <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ens
          perfectissimum</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, nothing better can be or
          be conceived. Thus there is no need of deliverance from it; and
          consequently there is none. But why the whole tragi-comedy exists
          cannot in the least be seen; for it has no spectators, and the
          actors themselves undergo infinite trouble, with little and merely
          negative pleasure.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Let us now add
          the consideration of the human race. The matter indeed becomes more
          complicated, and assumes a certain seriousness of aspect; but the
          fundamental character remains unaltered. Here also life presents
          itself by no means as a gift for enjoyment, but as a task, a
          drudgery to be performed; and in accordance with this we see, in
          great and small, universal need, ceaseless cares, constant
          pressure, endless strife, compulsory activity, with extreme
          exertion of all the powers of body and mind. Many millions, united
          into nations, strive for the common good, each individual on
          account of his own; but many thousands fall as a sacrifice for it.
          Now senseless delusions, now intriguing politics, incite them to
          wars with each other; then the sweat and the blood of the great
          multitude must flow, to carry out the ideas of individuals, or to
          expiate their faults. In peace industry and trade are active,
          inventions work miracles, seas are navigated, delicacies are
          collected from all ends of the world, the waves engulf thousands.
          All strive, some planning, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page115">[pg 115]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg115"></a> others acting; the tumult is indescribable.
          But the ultimate aim of it all, what is it? To sustain ephemeral
          and tormented individuals through a short span of time in the most
          fortunate case with endurable want and comparative freedom from
          pain, which, however, is at once attended with ennui; then the
          reproduction of this race and its striving. In this evident
          disproportion between the trouble and the reward, the will to live
          appears to us from this point of view, if taken objectively, as a
          fool, or subjectively, as a delusion, seized by which everything
          living works with the utmost exertion of its strength for something
          that is of no value. But when we consider it more closely, we shall
          find here also that it is rather a blind pressure, a tendency
          entirely without ground or motive.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The law of
          motivation, as was shown in § 29 of the first volume, only extends
          to the particular actions, not to willing <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as a whole and in
          general</span></em>. It depends upon this, that if we conceive of
          the human race and its action <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as a whole and universally</span></em>, it
          does not present itself to us, as when we contemplate the
          particular actions, as a play of puppets who are pulled after the
          ordinary manner by threads outside them; but from this point of
          view, as puppets which are set in motion by internal clockwork. For
          if, as we have done above, one compares the ceaseless, serious, and
          laborious striving of men with what they gain by it, nay, even with
          what they ever can gain, the disproportion we have pointed out
          becomes apparent, for one recognises that that which is to be
          gained, taken as the motive-power, is entirely insufficient for the
          explanation of that movement and that ceaseless striving. What,
          then, is a short postponement of death, a slight easing of misery
          or deferment of pain, a momentary stilling of desire, compared with
          such an abundant and certain victory over them all as death? What
          could such advantages accomplish taken as actual moving causes of a
          human race, innumerable because constantly renewed, which
          unceasingly moves, strives, struggles, grieves, writhes, and
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page116">[pg 116]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg116"></a> performs the whole
          tragi-comedy of the history of the world, nay, what says more than
          all, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">perseveres</span></em> in such a
          mock-existence as long as each one possibly can? Clearly this is
          all inexplicable if we seek the moving causes outside the figures
          and conceive the human race as striving, in consequence of rational
          reflection, or something analogous to this (as moving threads),
          after those good things held out to it, the attainment of which
          would be a sufficient reward for its ceaseless cares and troubles.
          The matter being taken thus, every one would rather have long ago
          said, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">Le
          jeu ne vaut pas la chandelle</span></span>,”</span> and have gone
          out. But, on the contrary, every one guards and defends his life,
          like a precious pledge intrusted to him under heavy responsibility,
          under infinite cares and abundant misery, even under which life is
          tolerable. The wherefore and the why, the reward for this,
          certainly he does not see; but he has accepted the worth of that
          pledge without seeing it, upon trust and faith, and does not know
          what it consists in. Hence I have said that these puppets are not
          pulled from without, but each bears in itself the clockwork from
          which its movements result. This is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the will to
          live</span></em>, manifesting itself as an untiring machine, an
          irrational tendency, which has not its sufficient reason in the
          external world. It holds the individuals firmly upon the scene, and
          is the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">primum mobile</span></span>
          of their movements; while the external objects, the motives, only
          determine their direction in the particular case; otherwise the
          cause would not be at all suitable to the effect. For, as every
          manifestation of a force of nature has a cause, but the force of
          nature itself none, so every particular act of will has a motive,
          but the will in general has none: indeed at bottom these two are
          one and the same. The will, as that which is metaphysical, is
          everywhere the boundary-stone of every investigation, beyond which
          it cannot go. From the original and unconditioned nature of the
          will, which has been proved, it is explicable that man loves beyond
          everything <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page117">[pg
          117]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg117"></a>
          else an existence full of misery, trouble, pain, and anxiety, and,
          again, full of ennui, which, if he considered and weighed it purely
          objectively, he would certainly abhor, and fears above all things
          the end of it, which is yet for him the one thing certain.<a href="#note_8" id="noteref_8" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">8</span></span></a>
          Accordingly we often see a miserable figure, deformed and shrunk
          with age, want, and disease, implore our help from the bottom of
          his heart for the prolongation of an existence, the end of which
          would necessarily appear altogether desirable if it were an
          objective judgment that determined here. Thus instead of this it is
          the blind will, appearing as the tendency to life, the love of
          life, and the sense of life; it is the same which makes the plants
          grow. This sense of life may be compared to a rope which is
          stretched above the puppet-show of the world of men, and on which
          the puppets hang by invisible threads, while apparently they are
          supported only by the ground beneath them (the objective value of
          life). But if the rope becomes weak the puppet sinks; if it breaks
          the puppet must fall, for the ground beneath it only seemed to
          support it: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the weakening of that love
          of life shows itself as hypochondria, spleen, melancholy: its
          entire exhaustion as the inclination to suicide, which now takes
          place on the slightest occasion, nay, for a merely imaginary
          reason, for now, as it were, the man seeks a quarrel with himself,
          in order to shoot himself dead, as many do with others for a like
          purpose;—indeed, upon necessity, suicide is resorted to without any
          special occasion. (Evidence of this will be found in Esquirol,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Des
          maladies mentales</span></span>, 1838.) And as with the persistence
          in life, so is it also with its action and movement. This is not
          something freely chosen; but while every one would really gladly
          rest, want and ennui are the whips that keep the top spinning.
          Therefore the whole and every individual bears the stamp of a
          forced condition; and every one, in that, inwardly weary, he longs
          for rest, but <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page118">[pg
          118]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg118"></a>
          yet must press forward, is like his planet, which does not fall
          into the sun only because a force driving it forward prevents it.
          Therefore everything is in continual strain and forced movement,
          and the course of the world goes on, to use an expression of
          Aristotle's (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De cœlo</span></span>, ii. 13), <span class="tei tei-q">“ου φυσει, αλλα βιᾳ”</span> (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Motu, non naturali sed
          violento</span></span>). Men are only apparently drawn from in
          front; really they are pushed from behind; it is not life that
          tempts them on, but necessity that drives them forward. The law of
          motivation is, like all causality, merely the form of the
          phenomenon. We may remark in passing that this is the source of the
          comical, the burlesque, the grotesque, the ridiculous side of life;
          for, urged forward against his will, every one bears himself as
          best he can, and the straits that thus arise often look comical
          enough, serious as is the misery which underlies them.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In all these
          considerations, then, it becomes clear to us that the will to live
          is not a consequence of the knowledge of life, is in no way a
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">conclusio ex præmissis</span></span>, and in
          general is nothing secondary. Rather, it is that which is first and
          unconditioned, the premiss of all premisses, and just on that
          account that from which philosophy must <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">start</span></em>,
          for the will to live does not appear in consequence of the world,
          but the world in consequence of the will to live.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I scarcely need
          to draw attention to the fact that the considerations with which we
          now conclude the second book already point forcibly to the serious
          theme of the fourth book, indeed would pass over into it directly
          if it were not that my architectonic symmetry makes it necessary
          that the third book, with its fair contents, should come between,
          as a second consideration of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the world as idea</span></em>, the conclusion
          of which, however, again points in the same direction.</p>

<span style="font-size: 144%">On The Knowledge Of The
          Ideas.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The intellect,
          which has hitherto only been considered in its original and natural
          condition of servitude under the will, appears in the third book in
          its deliverance from that bondage; with regard to which, however,
          it must at once be observed that we have not to do here with a
          lasting emancipation, but only with a brief hour of rest, an
          exceptional and indeed only momentary release from the service of
          the will. As this subject has been treated with sufficient fulness
          in the first volume, I have here only to add a few supplementary
          remarks.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As, then, was
          there explained, the intellect in its activity in the service of
          the will, thus in its natural function, knows only the mere
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">relations</span></em> of things; primarily to
          the will itself, to which it belongs, whereby they become motives
          of the will; but then also, just for the sake of the completeness
          of this knowledge, the relations of things to each other. This last
          knowledge first appears in some extent and importance in the human
          intellect; in the case of the brutes, on the other hand, even where
          the intellect is considerably developed, only within very narrow
          limits. Clearly even the apprehension of the relations which things
          have to each other only takes place, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page122">[pg 122]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg122"></a> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">indirectly</span></em>, in the service of the
          will. It therefore forms the transition to the purely objective
          knowledge, which is entirely independent of the will; it is
          scientific knowledge, the latter is artistic knowledge. If many and
          various relations of an object are immediately apprehended, from
          these the peculiar and proper nature of the object appears ever
          more distinctly, and gradually constructs itself out of mere
          relations: although it itself is entirely different from them. In
          this mode of apprehension the subjection of the intellect to the
          will at once becomes ever more indirect and less. If the intellect
          has strength enough to gain the preponderance, and let go
          altogether the relations of things to the will, in order to
          apprehend, instead of them, the purely objective nature of a
          phenomenon, which expresses itself through all relations, it also
          forsakes, along with the service of the will, the apprehension of
          mere relations, and thereby really also that of the individual
          thing as such. It then moves freely, no longer belonging to a will.
          In the individual thing it knows only the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">essential</span></em>, and therefore its whole
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">species</span></em>; consequently it now has
          for its object the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ideas</span></em>, in my sense, which agrees
          with the original, Platonic meaning of this grossly misused word;
          thus the permanent, unchanging forms, independent of the temporal
          existence of the individuals, the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">species rerum</span></span>, which really
          constitute what is purely objective in the phenomena. An Idea so
          apprehended is not yet indeed the essence of the thing in itself,
          just because it has sprung from knowledge of mere relations; yet,
          as the result of the sum of all the relations, it is the peculiar
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">character</span></em> of the thing, and
          thereby the complete expression of the essence which exhibits
          itself as an object of perception, comprehended, not in relation to
          an individual will, but as it expresses itself spontaneously,
          whereby indeed it determines all its relations, which till then
          alone were known. The Idea is the root point of all these
          relations, and thereby the complete and perfect phenomenon, or, as
          I have expressed <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page123">[pg
          123]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg123"></a>
          it in the text, the adequate objectivity of the will at this grade
          of its manifestation. Form and colour, indeed, which in the
          apprehension of the Idea by perception are what is immediate,
          belong at bottom not to the Idea itself, but are merely the medium
          of its expression; for, strictly speaking, space is as foreign to
          it as time. In this sense the Neo-Platonist Olympiodorus already
          says in his commentary on Plato's Alcibiades (Kreuzer's edition of
          Proclus and Olympiodorus, vol. ii. p. 82): <span class="tei tei-q">“το ειδος μεταδεδωκε μεν της μορφης τῃ ὑλῃ αμερες δε ον
          μετελαβεν εξ αυτης του δεαστατου:”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          the Idea, in itself unextended, imparted certainly the form to the
          matter, but first assumed extension from it. Thus, as was said, the
          Ideas reveal not the thing in itself, but only the objective
          character of things, thus still only the phenomenon; and we would
          not even understand this character if the inner nature of things
          were not otherwise known to us at least obscurely and in feeling.
          This nature itself cannot be understood from the Ideas, nor in
          general through any merely <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">objective</span></em> knowledge; therefore it
          would remain an eternal secret if we were not able to approach it
          from an entirely different side. Only because every knowing being
          is also an individual, and thereby a part of nature, does the
          approach to the inner being of nature stand open to him in his own
          self-consciousness, where, as we have found, it makes itself known
          in the most immediate manner as will.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now what the
          Platonic Idea is, regarded as a merely objective image, mere form,
          and thereby lifted out of time and all relations—that, taken
          empirically and in time, is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">species</span></em>
          or kind. This, then, is the empirical correlative of the Idea. The
          Idea is properly eternal, but the species is of endless duration,
          although its appearance upon one planet may become extinct. Even
          the names of the two pass over into each other: ιδεα, ειδος,
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">species</span></em>, kind. The Idea is the
          species, but not the genus: therefore the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">species</span></em>
          are the work of nature, the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">genera</span></span>
          the work of man; they are mere conceptions. There are <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">species</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page124">[pg 124]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg124"></a><span style="font-style: italic">naturales</span></span>, but only <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">genera logica</span></span>. Of manufactured
          articles there are no Ideas, but only conceptions; thus <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">genera logica</span></span>, and their
          subordinate classes are <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">species
          logicæ</span></span>. To what is said in this reference in vol. i.
          § 41, I will add here that Aristotle also (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Metaph.</span></span>
          i. 9 and xiii. 5) says that the Platonists admitted no ideas of
          manufactured articles: <span class="tei tei-q">“ὁιον οικια, και
          δακτυλιος, ὡν ου φασιν ειναι ειδη”</span> (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Ut
          domus et annulus, quorum ideas dari negant</span></span>). With
          which compare the Scholiast, p. 562, 563 of the Berlin quarto
          edition. Aristotle further says (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Metaph.</span></span>
          xi. 3): <span class="tei tei-q">“αλλ ειπερ (Supple., ειδῃ εστι) επι
          των φυσει (εστι) διο δη ου κακως ὁ Πλατων εφη, ὁτι ειδη εστι ὁποσα
          φυσει”</span> (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Si quidem ideæ sunt, in iis
          sunt, quæ natura fiunt: propter quod non male Plato dixit, quod
          species eorum sunt, quæ natura sunt</span></span>). On which the
          Scholiast remarks, p. 800: <span class="tei tei-q">“και τουτο
          αρεσκει και αυτοις τοις τας ιδεας θεμενοις; των γαρ ὑπο τεχνης
          γινομενων ιδεας ειναι ουκ ελεγον, αλλα των ὑπο φυσεως”</span>
          (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Hoc etiam ipsis ideas statuentibus placet: non
          enim arte factorum ideas dari ajebant, sed natura
          procreatorum</span></span>). For the rest, the doctrine of Ideas
          originated with the Pythagoreans, unless we distrust the assertion
          of Plutarch in the book, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De placitis philosophorum</span></span>, L. i.
          c. 3.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The individual
          is rooted in the species, and time in eternity. And as every
          individual is so only because it has the nature of its species in
          itself, so also it has only temporal existence because it is in
          eternity. In the following book a special chapter is devoted to the
          life of the species.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In § 49 of the
          first volume I have sufficiently brought out the difference between
          the Idea and the conception. Their resemblance, on the other hand,
          rests upon the following ground: The original and essential unity
          of an Idea becomes broken up into the multiplicity of individual
          things through the perception of the knowing individual, which is
          subject to sensuous and cerebral conditions. But that unity is then
          restored through the reflection of the reason, yet only <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">in abstracto</span></span>, as a concept,
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">universale</span></span>, which indeed is
          equal to the Idea in extension, but has assumed <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page125">[pg 125]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg125"></a> quite a different <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">form</span></em>,
          and has thereby lost its perceptible nature, and with this its
          thorough determinateness. In this sense (but in no other) we might,
          in the language of the Scholastics, describe the Ideas as
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">universalia ante rem</span></span>, the
          conceptions as <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">universalia post
          rem</span></span>. Between the two stand the individual things, the
          knowledge of which is possessed also by the brutes. Without doubt
          the realism of the Scholastics arose from the confusion of the
          Platonic Ideas, to which, since they are also the species, an
          objective real being can certainly be attributed, with the mere
          concepts to which the Realists now wished to attribute such a
          being, and thereby called forth the victorious opposition of
          Nominalism.</p>

<span style="font-size: 144%">On The Pure Subject Of
          Knowledge.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
          comprehension of an Idea, the entrance of it into our
          consciousness, is only possible by means of a change in us, which
          might also be regarded as an act of self-denial; for it consists in
          this, that knowledge turns away altogether from our own will, thus
          now leaves out of sight entirely the valuable pledge intrusted to
          it, and considers things as if they could never concern the will at
          all. For thus alone does knowledge become a pure mirror of the
          objective nature of things. Knowledge conditioned in this way must
          lie at the foundation of every genuine work of art as its origin.
          The change in the subject which is required for this cannot proceed
          from the will, just because it consists in the elimination of all
          volition; thus it can be no act of the will, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          it cannot lie in our choice. On the contrary, it springs only from
          a temporary preponderance of the intellect over the will, or,
          physiologically considered, from a strong excitement of the
          perceptive faculty of the brain, without any excitement of the
          desires or emotions. To explain this somewhat more accurately I
          remind the reader that our consciousness has two sides; partly, it
          is a consciousness of our <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">own selves</span></em>, which is the will;
          partly a consciousness of other things, and as such primarily,
          knowledge, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">through perception</span></em>, of the
          external world, the apprehension of objects. Now the more one side
          of the whole consciousness comes to the front, the more the other
          side withdraws. Accordingly, the consciousness of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">other
          things</span></em>, thus knowledge of perception, becomes the more
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page127">[pg 127]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg127"></a> perfect,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the more objective, the
          less we are conscious of ourselves at the time. Here exists an
          actual antagonism. The more we are conscious of the object, the
          less we are conscious of the subject; the more, on the other hand,
          the latter occupies our consciousness, the weaker and more
          imperfect is our perception of the external world. The state which
          is required for pure objectivity of perception has partly permanent
          conditions in the perfection of the brain and the general
          physiological qualities favourable to its activity, partly
          temporary conditions, inasmuch as such a state is favoured by all
          that increases the attention and heightens the susceptibility of
          the cerebral nervous system, yet without exciting any passion. One
          must not think here of spirituous drinks or opium; what is rather
          required is a night of quiet sleep, a cold bath, and all that
          procures for the brain activity an unforced predominance by
          quieting the circulation and calming the passions. It is especially
          these natural means of furthering the cerebral nervous activity
          which bring it about, certainly so much the better the more
          developed and energetic in general the brain is, that the object
          separates itself ever more from the subject, and finally introduces
          the state of pure objectivity of perception, which of itself
          eliminates the will from consciousness, and in which all things
          stand before us with increased clearness and distinctness, so that
          we are conscious almost only of them and scarcely at all of
          ourselves; thus our whole consciousness is almost nothing more than
          the medium through which the perceived object appears in the world
          as an idea. Thus it is necessary for pure, will-less knowledge that
          the consciousness of ourselves should vanish, since the
          consciousness of other things is raised to such a pitch. For we
          only apprehend the world in a purely objective manner when we no
          longer know that we belong to it; and all things appear the more
          beautiful the more we are conscious merely of them and the less we
          are conscious of ourselves. Since now all suffering proceeds from
          the will, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page128">[pg
          128]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg128"></a>
          which constitutes the real self, with the withdrawal of this side
          of consciousness all possibility of suffering is also abolished;
          therefore the condition of the pure objectivity of perception is
          one which throughout gives pleasure; and hence I have shown that in
          it lies one of the two constituent elements of æsthetic
          satisfaction. As soon, on the other hand, as the consciousness of
          our own self, thus subjectivity, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          the will, again obtains the upper hand, a proportional degree of
          discomfort or unrest also enters; of discomfort, because our
          corporealness (the organism which in itself is the will) is again
          felt; of unrest, because the will, on the path of thought, again
          fills the consciousness through wishes, emotions, passions, and
          cares. For the will, as the principle of subjectivity, is
          everywhere the opposite, nay, the antagonist of knowledge. The
          greatest concentration of subjectivity consists in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">act of
          will</span></em> proper, in which therefore we have the most
          distinct consciousness of our own self. All other excitements of
          the will are only preparations for this; the act of will itself is
          for subjectivity what for the electric apparatus is the passing of
          the spark. Every bodily sensation is in itself an excitement of the
          will, and indeed oftener of the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">noluntas</span></span> than of the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">voluntas</span></span>. The excitement of the
          will on the path of thought is that which occurs by means of
          motives; thus here the subjectivity is awakened and set in play by
          the objectivity itself. This takes place whenever any object is
          apprehended no longer in a purely objective manner, thus without
          participation in it, but, directly or indirectly, excites desire or
          aversion, even if it is only by means of a recollection, for then
          it acts as a motive in the widest sense of the word.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I remark here
          that abstract thinking and reading, which are connected with words,
          belong indeed in the wider sense to the consciousness <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">of other
          things</span></em>, thus to the objective employment of the mind;
          yet only indirectly, by means of conceptions. But the latter are
          the artificial product of the reason, and are therefore already a
          work <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page129">[pg 129]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg129"></a> of intention.
          Moreover, the will is the ruler of all abstract exercise of the
          mind, for, according to its aims, it imparts the direction, and
          also fixes the attention; therefore such mental activity is always
          accompanied by some effort; and this presupposes the activity of
          the will. Thus complete objectivity of consciousness does not exist
          with this kind of mental activity, as it accompanies the æsthetic
          apprehension, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the knowledge of the
          Ideas, as a condition.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In accordance
          with the above, the pure objectivity of perception, by virtue of
          which no longer the individual thing as such, but the Idea of its
          species is known, is conditioned by the fact that one is no longer
          conscious of oneself, but only of the perceived objects, so that
          one's own consciousness only remains as the supporter of the
          objective existence of these objects. What increases the difficulty
          of this state, and therefore makes it more rare, is, that in it the
          accident (the intellect) overcomes and annuls the substance (the
          will), although only for a short time. Here also lies the analogy
          and, indeed, the relationship of this with the denial of the will
          expounded at the end of the following book. Although knowledge, as
          was shown in the preceding book, is sprung from the will and is
          rooted in the manifestation of the will, the organism, yet it is
          just by the will that its purity is disturbed, as the flame is by
          the fuel and its smoke. It depends upon this that we can only
          apprehend the purely objective nature of things, the Ideas which
          appear in them, when we have ourselves no interest in them, because
          they stand in no relation to our will. From this, again, it arises
          that the Ideas of anything appeal to us more easily from a work of
          art than from reality. For what we behold only in a picture or in
          poetry stands outside all possibility of having any relation to our
          will; for in itself it exists only for knowledge and appeals
          immediately to knowledge alone. On the other hand, the apprehension
          of Ideas from reality assumes some measure <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page130">[pg 130]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg130"></a> of abstraction from our own volition, arising
          above its interests which demands a special power of the intellect.
          In a high degree, and for some duration, this belongs only to
          genius, which consists indeed in this, that a greater measure of
          the power of knowledge exists than is required for the service of
          an individual will, and this surplus becomes free, and now
          comprehends the world without reference to the will. Thus that the
          work of art facilitates so greatly the apprehension of the Ideas,
          in which æsthetic satisfaction consists, depends not merely upon
          the fact that art, by giving prominence to what is essential and
          eliminating what is unessential, presents the things more
          distinctly and characteristically, but just as much on the fact
          that the absolute silence of the will, which is demanded for the
          purely objective comprehension of the nature of the things, is
          attained with the greatest certainty when the perceived object
          itself lies entirely outside the province of things which are
          capable of having a relation to the will, because it is nothing
          real, but a mere picture. Now this holds good, not only of the
          works of plastic and pictorial art, but also of poetry; the effect
          of which is also conditioned by indifferent, will-less, and thereby
          purely objective apprehension. It is exactly this which makes a
          perceived object <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">picturesque</span></em>, an event of actual
          life <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">poetical</span></em>; for it is only this that
          throws over the objects of the real world that magic gleam which in
          the case of sensibly perceived objects is called the picturesque,
          and in the case of those which are only perceived in imagination is
          called the poetical. If poets sing of the blithe morning, the
          beautiful evening, the still moonlight night, and many such things,
          the real object of their praise is, unknown to themselves, the pure
          subject of knowledge which is called forth by those beauties of
          nature, and on the appearance of which the will vanishes from
          consciousness, and so that peace of heart enters which, apart from
          this, is unattainable in the world. How otherwise, for example,
          could the verse—</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page131">[pg

          beneficently, nay, so magically? Further, that the stranger or the
          mere passing traveller feels the picturesque or poetical effect of
          objects which are unable to produce this effect upon those who live
          among them may be explained from the fact that the novelty and
          complete strangeness of the objects of such an indifferent, purely
          objective apprehension are favourable to it. Thus, for example, the
          sight of an entirely strange town often makes a specially agreeable
          impression upon the traveller, which it by no means produces in the
          inhabitant of it; for it arises from the fact that the former,
          being out of all relation to this town and its inhabitants,
          perceives it purely objectively. Upon this depends partly the
          pleasure of travelling. This seems also to be the reason why it is
          sought to increase the effect of narrative or dramatic works by
          transferring the scene to distant times or lands: in Germany, to
          Italy or Spain; in Italy, to Germany, Poland, or even Holland. If
          now perfectly objective, intuitive apprehension, purified from all
          volition, is the condition of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">enjoyment</span></em> of æsthetic objects, so
          much the more is it the condition of their <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">production</span></em>. Every good picture,
          every genuine poem, bears the stamp of the frame of mind described.
          For only what has sprung from perception, and indeed from purely
          objective perception, or is directly excited by it, contains the
          living germ from which genuine and original achievements can grow
          up: not only in plastic and pictorial art, but also in poetry, nay,
          even in philosophy. The <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">punctum
          saliens</span></span> of every beautiful work, of every great or
          profound thought, is a purely objective perception. Such
          perception, however, is absolutely conditioned by the complete
          silence of the will, which leaves the man simply the pure subject
          of knowledge. The natural disposition for the predominance of this
          state is genius.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With the
          disappearance of volition from consciousness, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page132">[pg 132]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg132"></a> the individuality also, and with it its
          suffering and misery, is really abolished. Therefore I have
          described the pure subject of knowledge which then remains over as
          the eternal eye of the world, which, although with very different
          degrees of clearness, looks forth from all living creatures,
          untouched by their appearing and passing away, and thus, as
          identical with itself, as constantly one and the same, is the
          supporter of the world of permanent Ideas, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          of the adequate objectivity of the will; while the individual
          subject, whose knowledge is clouded by the individuality which
          springs from the will, has only particular things as its object,
          and is transitory as these themselves. In the sense here indicated
          a double existence may be attributed to every one. As will, and
          therefore as individual, he is only one, and this one exclusively,
          which gives him enough to do and to suffer. As the purely objective
          perceiver, he is the pure subject of knowledge in whose
          consciousness alone the objective world has its existence; as such
          he is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all
          things</span></em> so far as he perceives them. and in him is their
          existence without burden or inconvenience. It is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">his</span></em>
          existence, so far as it exists in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">his</span></em>
          idea; but it is there without will. So far, on the other hand, as
          it is will, it is not in him. It is well with every one when he is
          in that state in which he is all things; it is ill with him when in
          the state in which he is exclusively one. Every state, every man,
          every scene of life, requires only to be purely objectively
          apprehended and be made the subject of a sketch, whether with
          pencil or with words, in order to appear interesting, charming, and
          enviable; but if one is in it, if one is it oneself, then (it is
          often a case of) may the devil endure it. Therefore Goethe
          says—</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was a
          period in the years of my youth when I was always trying to see
          myself and my action from without, and picture it to myself;
          probably in order to make it more enjoyable to me.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page133">[pg 133]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg133"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As I have never
          spoken before on the subject I have just been considering, I wish
          to add a psychological illustration of it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the immediate
          perception of the world and of life we consider things, as a rule,
          merely in their relations, consequently according to their relative
          and not their absolute nature and existence. For example, we will
          regard houses, ships, machines, and the like with the thought of
          their end and their adaptation to it; men, with the thought of
          their relation to us, if they have any such; and then with that of
          their relations to each other, whether in their present action or
          with regard to their position and business, judging perhaps their
          fitness for it, &amp;c. Such a consideration of the relations we
          can follow more or less far to the most distant links of their
          chain: the consideration will thereby gain in accuracy and extent,
          but in its quality and nature it remains the same. It is the
          consideration of things in their relations, nay, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by means of
          these</span></em>, thus according to the principle of sufficient
          reason. Every one, for the most part and as a rule, is given up to
          this method of consideration; indeed I believe that most men are
          capable of no other. But if, as an exception, it happens that we
          experience a momentary heightening of the intensity of our
          intuitive intelligence, we at once see things with entirely
          different eyes, in that we now apprehend them no longer according
          to their relations, but according to that which they are in and for
          themselves, and suddenly perceive their absolute existence apart
          from their relative existence. At once every individual represents
          its species; and accordingly we now apprehend the universal of
          every being. Now what we thus know are the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ideas of
          things</span></em>; but out of these there now speaks a higher
          wisdom than that which knows of mere relations. And we also have
          then passed out of the relations, and have thus become the pure
          subject of knowledge. But what now exceptionally brings about this
          state must be internal physiological processes, which purify the
          activity <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page134">[pg
          134]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg134"></a>
          of the brain, and heighten it to such a degree that a sudden
          spring-tide of activity like this ensues. The external conditions
          of this are that we remain completely strange to the scene to be
          considered, and separated from it, and are absolutely not actively
          involved in it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In order to see
          that a purely objective, and therefore correct, comprehension of
          things is only possible when we consider them without any personal
          participation in them, thus when the will is perfectly silent, let
          one call to mind how much every emotion or passion disturbs and
          falsifies our knowledge, indeed how every inclination and aversion
          alters, colours, and distorts not only the judgment, but even the
          original perception of things. Let one remember how when we are
          gladdened by some fortunate occurrence the whole world at once
          assumes a bright colour and a smiling aspect, and, on the contrary,
          looks gloomy and sad when we are pressed with cares; also, how even
          a lifeless thing, if it is to be made use of in doing something
          which we abhor, seems to have a hideous physiognomy; for example,
          the scaffold, the fortress, to which we have been brought, the
          surgeon's cases of instruments; the travelling carriage of our
          loved one, &amp;c., nay, numbers, letters, seals, may seem to grin
          upon us horribly and affect us as fearful monstrosities. On the
          other hand, the tools for the accomplishment of our wishes at once
          appear to us agreeable and pleasing; for example, the hump-backed
          old woman with the love-letter, the Jew with the louis d'ors, the
          rope-ladder to escape by, &amp;c. As now here the falsification of
          the idea through the will in the case of special abhorrence or love
          is unmistakable, so is it present in a less degree in every object
          which has any even distant relation to our will, that is, to our
          desire or aversion. Only when the will with its interests has left
          consciousness, and the intellect freely follows its own laws, and
          as pure subject mirrors the objective world, yet in doing so,
          although spurred on by no volition, is of its own inclination in
          the highest <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page135">[pg
          135]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg135"></a>
          state of tension and activity, do the colours and forms of things
          appear in their true and full significance. Thus it is from such
          comprehension alone that genuine works of art can proceed whose
          permanent worth and ever renewed approval arises simply from the
          fact that they express the purely objective element, which lies at
          the foundation of and shines through the different subjective, and
          therefore distorted, perceptions, as that which is common to them
          all and alone stands fast; as it were the common theme of all those
          subjective variations. For certainly the nature which is displayed
          before our eyes exhibits itself very differently in different
          minds; and as each one sees it so alone can he repeat it, whether
          with the pencil or the chisel, or with words and gestures on the
          stage. Objectivity alone makes one capable of being an artist; but
          objectivity is only possible in this way, that the intellect,
          separated from its root the will, moves freely, and yet acts with
          the highest degree of energy.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To the youth
          whose perceptive intellect still acts with fresh energy nature
          often exhibits itself with complete objectivity, and therefore with
          perfect beauty. But the pleasure of such a glance is sometimes
          disturbed by the saddening reflection that the objects present
          which exhibit themselves in such beauty do not stand in a personal
          relation to this will, by virtue of which they could interest and
          delight him; he expects his life in the form of an interesting
          romance. <span class="tei tei-q">“Behind that jutting cliff the
          well-mounted band of friends should await me,—beside that waterfall
          my love should rest; this beautifully lighted building should be
          her dwelling, and that vine-clad window hers;—but this beautiful
          world is for me a desert!”</span> and so on. Such melancholy
          youthful reveries really demand something exactly contradictory to
          themselves; for the beauty with which those objects present
          themselves depends just upon the pure objectivity, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          disinterestedness of their perception, and would therefore at once
          be abolished by the relation to his own will which the youth
          painfully misses, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page136">[pg
          136]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg136"></a>
          and thus the whole charm which now affords him pleasure, even
          though alloyed with a certain admixture of pain, would cease to
          exist. The same holds good, moreover, of every age and every
          relation; the beauty of the objects of a landscape which now
          delights us would vanish if we stood in personal relations to them,
          of which we remained always conscious. Everything is beautiful only
          so long as it does not concern us. (We are not speaking here of
          sensual passion, but of æsthetic pleasure.) Life is never
          beautiful, but only the pictures of life are so in the
          transfiguring mirror of art or poetry; especially in youth, when we
          do not yet know it. Many a youth would receive great peace of mind
          if one could assist him to this knowledge.</p>

          us, because, without any relation to us, it moves along for ever
          strange to earthly doings, and sees all while it takes part in
          nothing. Therefore, at the sight of it the will, with its constant
          neediness, vanishes from consciousness, and leaves a purely knowing
          consciousness behind. Perhaps there is also mingled here a feeling
          that we share this sight with millions, whose individual
          differences are therein extinguished, so that in this perception
          they are one, which certainly increases the impression of the
          sublime. Finally, this is also furthered by the fact that the moon
          lights without heating, in which certainly lies the reason why it
          has been called chaste and identified with Diana. In consequence of
          this whole beneficent impression upon our feeling, the moon becomes
          gradually our bosom friend. The sun, again, never does so; but is

          unspeakable, pleasure which is excited in us by the impression of
          colours, strengthened by the gleam of metal, and still more by
          transparency, as, for example, in coloured windows, and in a
          greater measure by means of the clouds and their reflection at
          sunset,—ultimately depends upon the fact that here in the easiest
          manner, almost by a physical necessity, our whole interest is won
          for knowledge, without any excitement of our will, so that we enter
          the state of pure knowing, although for the most part this consists
          here in a mere sensation of the affection of the retina, which,
          however, as it is in itself perfectly free from pain or pleasure,
          and therefore entirely without direct influence on the will, thus
          belongs to pure knowledge.</p>

<span style="font-size: 144%">On Genius.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What is properly
          denoted by the name genius is the predominating capacity for that
          kind of knowledge which has been described in the two preceding
          chapters, the knowledge from which all genuine works of art and
          poetry, and even of philosophy, proceed. Accordingly, since this
          has for its objects the Platonic Ideas, and these are not
          comprehended in the abstract, but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">only
          perceptibly</span></em>, the essence of genius must lie in the
          perfection and energy of the knowledge of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">perception</span></em>. Corresponding to this,
          the works which we hear most decidedly designated works of genius
          are those which start immediately from perception and devote
          themselves to perception; thus those of plastic and pictorial art,
          and then those of poetry, which gets its perceptions by the
          assistance of the imagination. The difference between genius and
          mere talent makes itself noticeable even here. For talent is an
          excellence which lies rather in the greater versatility and
          acuteness of discursive than of intuitive knowledge. He who is
          endowed with talent thinks more quickly and more correctly than
          others; but the genius beholds another world from them all,
          although only because he has a more profound perception of the
          world which lies before them also, in that it presents itself in
          his mind more objectively, and consequently in greater purity and
          distinctness.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page139">[pg
          139]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg139"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The intellect
          is, according to its destination, merely the medium of motives; and
          in accordance with this it originally comprehends nothing in things
          but their relations to the will, the direct, the indirect, and the
          possible. In the case of the brutes, where it is almost entirely
          confined to the direct relations, the matter is just on that
          account most apparent: what has no relation to their will does not
          exist for them. Therefore we sometimes see with surprise that even
          clever animals do not observe at all something conspicuous to them;
          for example, they show no surprise at obvious alterations in our
          person and surroundings. In the case of normal men the indirect,
          and even the possible, relations to the will are added, the sum of
          which make up the total of useful knowledge; but here also
          knowledge remains confined to the relations. Therefore the normal
          mind does not attain to an absolutely pure, objective picture of
          things, because its power of perception, whenever it is not spurred
          on by the will and set in motion, at once becomes tired and
          inactive, because it has not enough energy of its own elasticity
          and without an end in view to apprehend the world in a purely
          objective manner. Where, on the other hand, this takes place—where
          the brain has such a surplus of the power of ideation that a pure,
          distinct, objective image of the external world exhibits itself
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">without
          any aim</span></em>; an image which is useless for the intentions
          of the will, indeed, in the higher degrees, disturbing, and even
          injurious to them—there, the natural disposition, at least, is
          already present for that abnormity which the name genius denotes,
          which signifies that here a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">genius</span></em> foreign to the will,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, to the I proper, as it
          were coming from without, seems to be active. But to speak without
          a figure: genius consists in this, that the knowing faculty has
          received a considerably greater development than the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">service of the
          will</span></em>, for which alone it originally appeared, demands.
          Therefore, strictly speaking, physiology might to a certain extent
          class such a superfluity of brain activity, and with it of brain
          itself, among the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">monstra per
          excessum</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page140">[pg
          140]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg140"></a>
          which, it is well known, it co-ordinates with <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">monstra per defectum</span></span> and those
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">per situm mutatum</span></span>. Thus genius
          consists in an abnormally large measure of intellect, which can
          only find its use by being applied to the universal of existence,
          whereby it then devotes itself to the service of the whole human
          race, as the normal intellect to that of the individual. In order
          to make this perfectly comprehensible one might say: if the normal
          man consists of two-thirds will and one-third intellect, the
          genius, on the contrary, has two-thirds intellect and one-third
          will. This might, then, be further illustrated by a chemical
          simile: the base and the acid of a neutral salt are distinguished
          by the fact that in each of the two the radical has the converse
          relation to oxygen to that which it has in the other. The base or
          the alkali is so because in it the radical predominates with
          reference to oxygen, and the acid is so because in it oxygen
          predominates. In the same way now the normal man and the genius are
          related in respect of will and intellect. From this arises a
          thorough distinction between them, which is visible even in their
          whole nature and behaviour, but comes out most clearly in their
          achievements. One might add the difference that while that total
          opposition between the chemical materials forms the strongest
          affinity and attraction between them, in the human race the
          opposite is rather wont to be found.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first
          manifestation which such a superfluity of the power of knowledge
          calls forth shows itself for the most part in the most original and
          fundamental knowledge, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, in knowledge of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">perception</span></em>, and occasions the
          repetition of it in an image; hence arises the painter and the
          sculptor. In their case, then, the path between the apprehension of
          genius and the artistic production is the shortest; therefore the
          form in which genius and its activity here exhibits itself is the
          simplest and its description the easiest. Yet here also the source
          is shown from which all genuine productions in every art, in
          poetry, and indeed in philosophy, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page141">[pg 141]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg141"></a> have their origin, although in the case of
          these the process is not so simple.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Let the result
          arrived at in the first book be here borne in mind, that all
          perception is intellectual and not merely sensuous. If one now adds
          the exposition given here, and, at the same time, in justice
          considers that the philosophy of last century denoted the
          perceptive faculty of knowledge by the name <span class="tei tei-q">“lower powers of the soul,”</span> we will not think it
          so utterly absurd nor so deserving of the bitter scorn with which
          Jean Paul quotes it in his <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vorschule der
          Æsthetik</span></span>,”</span> that Adelung, who had to speak the
          language of his age, placed genius in <span class="tei tei-q">“a
          remarkable strength of the lower powers of the soul.”</span> The
          work just referred to of this author, who is so worthy of our
          admiration, has great excellences, but yet I must remark that all
          through, whenever a theoretical explanation and, in general,
          instruction is the end in view, a style of exposition which is
          constantly indulging in displays of wit and hurrying along in mere
          similes cannot be well adapted to the purpose.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is, then,
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">perception</span></em> to which primarily the
          peculiar and true nature of things, although still in a conditioned
          manner, discloses and reveals itself. All conceptions and
          everything thought are mere abstractions, consequently partial
          ideas taken from perception, and have only arisen by thinking away.
          All profound knowledge, even wisdom properly so called, is rooted
          in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">perceptive</span></em> apprehension of things,
          as we have fully considered in the supplements to the first book. A
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">perceptive</span></em> apprehension has always
          been the generative process in which every genuine work of art,
          every immortal thought, received the spark of life. All primary
          thought takes place in pictures. From conceptions, on the other
          hand, arise the works of mere talent, the merely rational thoughts,
          imitations, and indeed all that is calculated merely with reference
          to the present need and contemporary conditions.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But if now our
          perception were constantly bound to the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page142">[pg 142]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg142"></a> real present of things, its material would be
          entirely under the dominion of chance, which seldom produces things
          at the right time, seldom arranges them for an end and for the most
          part presents them to us in very defective examples. Therefore the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">imagination</span></em> is required in order
          to complete, arrange, give the finishing touches to, retain, and
          repeat at pleasure all those significant pictures of life,
          according as the aims of a profoundly penetrating knowledge and of
          the significant work whereby they are to be communicated may
          demand. Upon this rests the high value of imagination, which is an
          indispensable tool of genius. For only by virtue of imagination can
          genius ever, according to the requirements of the connection of its
          painting or poetry or thinking, call up to itself each object or
          event in a lively image, and thus constantly draw fresh nourishment
          from the primary source of all knowledge, perception. The man who
          is endowed with imagination is able, as it were, to call up
          spirits, who at the right time reveal to him the truths which the
          naked reality of things exhibits only weakly, rarely, and then for
          the most part at the wrong time. Therefore the man without
          imagination is related to him, as the mussel fastened to its rock,
          which must wait for what chance may bring it, is related to the
          freely moving or even winged animal. For such a man knows nothing
          but the actual perception of the senses: till it comes he gnaws at
          conceptions and abstractions which are yet mere shells and husks,
          not the kernel of knowledge. He will never achieve anything great,
          unless it be in calculating and mathematics. The works of plastic
          and pictorial art and of poetry, as also the achievements of
          mimicry, may also be regarded as means by which those who have no
          imagination may make up for this defect as far as possible, and
          those who are gifted with it may facilitate the use of it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus, although
          the kind of knowledge which is peculiar and essential to genius is
          knowledge of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">perception</span></em>, yet the special object
          of this knowledge by no means consists of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page143">[pg 143]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg143"></a> the particular things, but of the Platonic
          Ideas which manifest themselves in these, as their apprehension was
          analysed in chapter 29. Always to see the universal in the
          particular is just the fundamental characteristic of genius, while
          the normal man knows in the particular only the particular as such,
          for only as such does it belong to the actual which alone has
          interests for him, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, relations to his
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em>. The degree in which every
          one not merely thinks, but actually perceives, in the particular
          thing, only the particular, or a more or less universal up to the
          most universal of the species, is the measure of his approach to
          genius. And corresponding to this, only the nature of things
          generally, the universal in them, the whole, is the special object
          of genius. The investigation of the particular phenomena is the
          field of the talents, in the real sciences, whose special object is
          always only the relations of things to each other.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What was fully
          shown in the preceding chapter, that the apprehension of the Ideas
          is conditioned by the fact that the knower is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pure
          subject</span></em> of knowledge, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          that the will entirely vanishes from consciousness, must be borne
          in mind here. The pleasure which we have in many of Goethe's songs
          which bring the landscape before our eyes, or in Jean Paul's
          sketches of nature, depends upon the fact that we thereby
          participate in the objectivity of those minds, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          the purity with which in them the world as idea separated from the
          world as will, and, as it were, entirely emancipated itself from
          it. It also follows from the fact that the kind of knowledge
          peculiar to genius is essentially that which is purified from all
          will and its relations, that the works of genius do not proceed
          from intention or choice, but it is guided in them by a kind of
          instinctive necessity. What is called the awaking of genius, the
          hour of initiation, the moment of inspiration, is nothing but the
          attainment of freedom by the intellect, when, delivered for a while
          from its service under the will, it does not now sink into
          inactivity or <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page144">[pg
          144]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg144"></a>
          lassitude, but is active for a short time entirely alone and
          spontaneously. Then it is of the greatest purity, and becomes the
          clear mirror of the world; for, completely severed from its origin,
          the will, it is now the world as idea itself, concentrated in
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> consciousness. In such
          moments, as it were, the souls of immortal works are begotten. On
          the other hand, in all intentional reflection the intellect is not
          free, for indeed the will guides it and prescribes it its
          theme.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The stamp of
          commonness, the expression of vulgarity, which is impressed on the
          great majority of countenances consists really in this, that in
          them becomes visible the strict subordination of their knowledge to
          their will, the firm chain which binds these two together, and the
          impossibility following from this of apprehending things otherwise
          than in their relation to the will and its aims. On the other hand,
          the expression of genius which constitutes the evident family
          likeness of all highly gifted men consists in this, that in it we
          distinctly read the liberation, the manumission of the intellect
          from the service of the will, the predominance of knowledge over
          volition; and because all anxiety proceeds from the will, and
          knowledge, on the contrary, is in and for itself painless and
          serene, this gives to their lofty brow and clear, perceiving
          glance, which are not subject to the service of the will and its
          wants, that look of great, almost supernatural serenity which at
          times breaks through, and consists very well with the melancholy of
          their other features, especially the mouth, and which in this
          relation may be aptly described by the motto of Giordano Bruno:
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">In tristitia hilaris, in hilaritate
          tristis</span></span>.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The will, which
          is the root of the intellect, opposes itself to any activity of the
          latter which is directed to anything else but its own aims.
          Therefore the intellect is only capable of a purely objective and
          profound comprehension of the external world when it has freed
          itself at least for a while from this its root. So long as it
          remains bound <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page145">[pg
          145]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg145"></a>
          to the will, it is of its own means capable of no activity, but
          sleeps in a stupor, whenever the will (the interests) does not
          awake it, and set it in motion. If, however, this happens, it is
          indeed very well fitted to recognise the relations of things
          according to the interest of the will, as the prudent mind does,
          which, however, must always be an awakened mind, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, a
          mind actively aroused by volition; but just on this account it is
          not capable of comprehending the purely objective nature of things.
          For the willing and the aims make it so one-sided that it sees in
          things only that which relates to these, and the rest either
          disappears or enters consciousness in a falsified form. For
          example, the traveller in anxiety and haste will see the Rhine and
          its banks only as a line, and the bridges over it only as lines
          cutting it. In the mind of the man who is filled with his own aims
          the world appears as a beautiful landscape appears on the plan of a
          battlefield. Certainly these are extremes, taken for the sake of
          distinctness; but every excitement of the will, however slight,
          will have as its consequence a slight but constantly proportionate
          falsification of knowledge. The world can only appear in its true
          colour and form, in its whole and correct significance, when the
          intellect, devoid of willing, moves freely over the objects, and
          without being driven on by the will is yet energetically active.
          This is certainly opposed to the nature and determination of the
          intellect, thus to a certain extent unnatural, and just on this
          account exceedingly rare; but it is just in this that the essential
          nature of genius lies, in which alone that condition takes place in
          a high degree and is of some duration, while in others it only
          appears approximately and exceptionally. I take it to be in the
          sense expounded here that Jean Paul (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vorschule der
          Æsthetik</span></span>, § 12) places the essence of genius in
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">reflectiveness</span></em>. The normal man is
          sunk in the whirl and tumult of life, to which he belongs through
          his will; his intellect is filled with the things and events of
          life; but he does <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page146">[pg
          146]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg146"></a>
          not know these things nor life itself in their objective
          significance; as the merchant on 'Change in Amsterdam apprehends
          perfectly what his neighbour says, but does not hear the hum of the
          whole Exchange, like the sound of the sea, which astonishes the
          distant observer. From the genius, on the contrary, whose intellect
          is delivered from the will, and thus from the person, what concerns
          these does not conceal the world and things themselves; but he
          becomes distinctly conscious of them, he apprehends them in and for
          themselves in objective perception; in this sense he is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">reflective</span></em>.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">reflectiveness</span></em> which enables the
          painter to repeat the natural objects which he contemplates
          faithfully upon the canvas, and the poet accurately to call up
          again the concrete present, by means of abstract conceptions, by
          giving it utterance and so bringing it to distinct consciousness,
          and also to express everything in words which others only feel. The
          brute lives entirely without reflection. It has consciousness,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, it knows itself and its
          good and ill, also the objects which occasion these. But its
          knowledge remains always subjective, never becomes objective;
          everything that enters it seems a matter of course, and therefore
          can never become for it a theme (an object of exposition) nor a
          problem (an object of meditation). Its consciousness is thus
          entirely <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">immanent</span></em>. Not certainly the same,
          but yet of kindred nature, is the consciousness of the common type
          of man, for his apprehension also of things and the world is
          predominantly subjective and remains prevalently immanent. It
          apprehends the things in the world, but not the world; its own
          action and suffering, but not itself. As now in innumerable
          gradations the distinctness of consciousness rises, reflectiveness
          appears more and more; and thus it is brought about little by
          little that sometimes, though rarely, and then again in very
          different degrees of distinctness, the question passes through the
          mind like a flash, <span class="tei tei-q">“What is all
          this?”</span> or again, <span class="tei tei-q">“How is it really
          fashioned?”</span> The <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page147">[pg
          147]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg147"></a>
          first question, if it attains great distinctness and continued
          presence, will make the philosopher, and the other, under the same
          conditions, the artist or the poet. Therefore, then, the high
          calling of both of these has its root in the reflectiveness which
          primarily springs from the distinctness with which they are
          conscious of the world and their own selves, and thereby come to
          reflect upon them. But the whole process springs from the fact that
          the intellect through its preponderance frees itself for a time
          from the will, to which it is originally subject.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
          considerations concerning genius here set forth are connected by
          way of supplement with the exposition contained in chapter 21, of
          the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ever
          wider separation of the will and the intellect</span></em>, which
          can be traced in the whole series of existences. This reaches its
          highest grade in genius, where it extends to the entire liberation
          of the intellect from its root the will, so that here the intellect
          becomes perfectly free, whereby the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">world as
          idea</span></em> first attains to complete objectification.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A few remarks
          now concerning the individuality of genius. Aristotle has already
          said, according to Cicero (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tusc.</span></span>, i. 33), <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Omnes ingeniosos
          melancholicos esse</span></span>;”</span> which without doubt is
          connected with the passage of Aristotle's <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Problemata</span></span>,”</span> xxx. 1.
          Goethe also says: <span class="tei tei-q">“My poetic rapture was
          very small, so long as I only encountered good; but it burnt with a
          bright flame when I fled from threatening evil. The tender poem,
          like the rainbow, is only drawn on a dark ground; hence the genius
          of the poet loves the element of melancholy.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is to be
          explained from the fact that since the will constantly
          re-establishes its original sway over the intellect, the latter
          more easily withdraws from this under unfavourable personal
          relations; because it gladly turns from adverse circumstances, in
          order to a certain extent to divert itself, and now directs itself
          with so much the greater energy to the foreign external world, thus
          more easily becomes purely objective. Favourable personal
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page148">[pg 148]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg148"></a> relations act
          conversely. Yet as a whole and in general the melancholy which
          accompanies genius depends upon the fact that the brighter the
          intellect which enlightens the will to live, the more distinctly
          does it perceive the misery of its condition. The melancholy
          disposition of highly gifted minds which has so often been observed
          has its emblem in Mont Blanc, the summit of which is for the most
          part lost in clouds; but when sometimes, especially in the early
          morning, the veil of clouds is rent and now the mountain looks down
          on Chamounix from its height in the heavens above the clouds, then
          it is a sight at which the heart of each of us swells from its
          profoundest depths. So also the genius, for the most part
          melancholy, shows at times that peculiar serenity already described
          above, which is possible only for it, and springs from the most
          perfect objectivity of the mind. It floats like a ray of light upon
          his lofty brow: <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">In tristitia hilaris, in
          hilaritate tristis</span></span>.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All bunglers are
          so ultimately because their intellect, still too firmly bound to
          the will, only becomes active when spurred on by it, and therefore
          remains entirely in its service. They are accordingly only capable
          of personal aims. In conformity with these they produce bad
          pictures, insipid poems, shallow, absurd, and very often dishonest
          philosophemes, when it is to their interest to recommend themselves
          to high authorities by a pious disingenuousness. Thus all their
          action and thought is personal. Therefore they succeed at most in
          appropriating what is external, accidental, and arbitrary in the
          genuine works of others as mannerisms, in doing which they take the
          shell instead of the kernel, and yet imagine they have attained to
          everything, nay, have surpassed those works. If, however, the
          failure is patent, yet many hope to attain success in the end
          through their good intentions. But it is just this good will which
          makes success impossible; because this only pursues personal ends,
          and with these neither art nor poetry nor philosophy can ever be
          taken seriously. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page149">[pg
          149]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg149"></a>
          Therefore the saying is peculiarly applicable to such persons:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“They stand in their own light.”</span>
          They have no idea that it is only the intellect delivered from the
          government of the will and all its projects, and therefore freely
          active, that makes one capable of genuine productions, because it
          alone imparts true seriousness; and it is well for them that they
          have not, otherwise they would leap into the water. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">good
          will</span></em> is in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">morality</span></em> everything; but in art it
          is nothing. In art, as the word itself indicates (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">Kunst</span></span>), what alone is of
          consequence is ability (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">Können</span></span>). It all amounts
          ultimately to this, where the true <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">seriousness</span></em> of the man lies. In
          almost all it lies exclusively in their own well-being and that of
          their families; therefore they are in a position to promote this
          and nothing else; for no purpose, no voluntary and intentional
          effort, imparts the true, profound, and proper seriousness, or
          makes up for it, or more correctly, takes its place. For it always
          remains where nature has placed it; and without it everything is
          only half performed. Therefore, for the same reason, persons of
          genius often manage so badly for their own welfare. As a leaden
          weight always brings a body back to the position which its centre
          of gravity thereby determined demands, so the true seriousness of
          the man always draws the strength and attention of the intellect
          back to that in which it lies; everything else the man does
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">without
          true seriousness</span></em>. Therefore only the exceedingly rare
          and abnormal men whose true seriousness does not lie in the
          personal and practical, but in the objective and theoretical, are
          in a position to apprehend what is essential in the things of the
          world, thus the highest truths, and reproduce them in any way. For
          such a seriousness of the individual, falling outside himself in
          the objective, is something foreign to the nature of man, something
          unnatural, or really supernatural: yet on account of this alone is
          the man <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">great</span></em>; and therefore what he
          achieves is then ascribed to a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">genius</span></em>
          different from himself, which takes possession of him. To such a
          man <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page150">[pg 150]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg150"></a> his painting,
          poetry, or thinking is an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">end</span></em>; to others it is a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">means</span></em>.
          The latter thereby seek their own things, and, as a rule, they know
          how to further them, for they flatter their contemporaries, ready
          to serve their wants and humours; therefore for the most part they
          live in happy circumstances; the former often in very miserable
          circumstances. For he sacrifices his personal welfare to his
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">objective
          end</span></em>; he cannot indeed do otherwise, because his
          seriousness lies there. They act conversely; therefore they are
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">small</span></em>, but he is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">great</span></em>.
          Accordingly his work is for all time, but the recognition of it
          generally only begins with posterity: they live and die with their
          time. In general he only is great who in his work, whether it is
          practical or theoretical, seeks <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not his own
          concerns</span></em>, but pursues an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">objective
          end</span></em> alone; he is so, however, even when in the
          practical sphere this end is a misunderstood one, and even if in
          consequence of this it should be a crime. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">That he seeks not
          himself and his own concerns</span></em>, this makes him under all
          circumstances <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">great</span></em>. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Small</span></em>,
          on the other hand, is all action which is directed to personal
          ends; for whoever is thereby set in activity knows and finds
          himself only in his own transient and insignificant person. He who
          is great, again, finds himself in all, and therefore in the whole:
          he lives not, like others, only in the microcosm, but still more in
          the macrocosm. Hence the whole interests him, and he seeks to
          comprehend it in order to represent it, or to explain it, or to act
          practically upon it. For it is not strange to him; he feels that it
          concerns him. On account of this extension of his sphere he is
          called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">great</span></em>. Therefore that lofty
          predicate belongs only to the true hero, in some sense, and to
          genius: it signifies that they, contrary to human nature, have not
          sought their own things, have not lived for themselves, but for
          all. As now clearly the great majority must <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">constantly</span></em> be small, and can
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">never</span></em> become great, the converse
          of this, that one should be great throughout, that is, constantly
          and every moment, is yet not possible—</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page151">[pg 151]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg151"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Every great man
          must often be only the individual, have only himself in view, and
          that means he must be small. Upon this depends the very true
          remark, that no man is a hero to his valet, and not upon the fact
          that the valet cannot appreciate the hero; which Goethe, in the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Wahlverwandhschaften</span></span>”</span>
          (vol. ii. chap. 5), serves up as an idea of Ottilie's.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Genius is its
          own reward: for the best that one is, one must necessarily be for
          oneself. <span class="tei tei-q">“Whoever is born with a talent, to
          a talent, finds in this his fairest existence,”</span> says Goethe.
          When we look back at a great man of former times, we do not think,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“How happy is he to be still admired by all
          of us!”</span> but, <span class="tei tei-q">“How happy must he have
          been in the immediate enjoyment of a mind at the surviving traces
          of which centuries revive themselves!”</span> Not in the fame, but
          in that whereby it is attained, lies the value, and in the
          production of immortal children the pleasure. Therefore those who
          seek to show the vanity of posthumous fame from the fact that he
          who obtains it knows nothing of it, may be compared to the wiseacre
          who very learnedly tried to demonstrate to the man who cast envious
          glances at a heap of oyster-shells in his neighbour's yard the
          absolute uselessness of them.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">According to the
          exposition of the nature of genius which has been given, it is so
          far contrary to nature, inasmuch as it consists in this, that the
          intellect, whose real destination is the service of the will,
          emancipates itself from this service in order to be active on its
          own account. Accordingly genius is an intellect which has become
          untrue to its destination. Upon this depend the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">disadvantages</span></em> connected with it,
          for the consideration of which we shall now prepare the way by
          comparing genius with the less decided predominance of the
          intellect.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The intellect of
          the normal man, strictly bound to the service of the will, and
          therefore really only occupied <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page152">[pg 152]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg152"></a> with the apprehension of motives, may be
          regarded as a complex system of wires, by means of which each of
          these puppets is set in motion in the theatre of the world. From
          this arises the dry, grave seriousness of most people, which is
          only surpassed by that of the brutes, who never laugh. On the other
          hand, we might compare the genius, with his unfettered intellect,
          to a living man playing along with the large puppets of the famous
          puppet-show at Milan, who would be the only one among them who
          would understand everything, and would therefore gladly leave the
          stage for a while to enjoy the play from the boxes;—that is the
          reflectiveness of genius. But even the man of great understanding
          and reason, whom one might almost call wise, is very different from
          the genius, and in this way, that his intellect retains a
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">practical</span></em> tendency, is concerned
          with the choice of the best ends and means, therefore remains in
          the service of the will, and accordingly is occupied in a manner
          that is thoroughly in keeping with nature. The firm, practical
          seriousness of life which the Romans denoted <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gravitas</span></span> presupposes that the
          intellect does not forsake the service of the will in order to
          wander away after that which does not concern the will; therefore
          it does not admit of that separation of the will and the intellect
          which is the condition of genius. The able, nay, eminent man, who
          is fitted for great achievements in the practical sphere, is so
          precisely because objects rouse his will in a lively manner, and
          spur him on to the ceaseless investigation of their relations and
          connections. Thus his intellect has grown up closely connected with
          his will. Before the man of genius, on the contrary, there floats
          in his objective comprehension the phenomenon of the world, as
          something foreign to him, an object of contemplation, which expels
          his will from consciousness. Round this point turns the distinction
          between the capacity for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">deeds</span></em> and for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">works</span></em>.
          The latter demand objectivity and depth of knowledge, which
          presupposes entire separation of the intellect from <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page153">[pg 153]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg153"></a> the will; the former, on the other
          hand, demands the application of knowledge, presence of mind, and
          decision, which required that the intellect should uninterruptedly
          attend to the service of the will. Where the bond between the
          intellect and the will is loosened, the intellect, turned away from
          its natural destination, will neglect the service of the will; it
          will, for example, even in the need of the moment, preserve its
          emancipation, and perhaps be unable to avoid taking in the
          picturesque impression of the surroundings, from which danger
          threatens the individual. The intellect of the reasonable and
          understanding man, on the other hand, is constantly at its post, is
          directed to the circumstances and their requirements. Such a man
          will therefore in all cases determine and carry out what is
          suitable to the case, and consequently will by no means fall into
          those eccentricities, personal slips, nay, follies, to which the
          genius is exposed, because his intellect does not remain
          exclusively the guide and guardian of his will, but sometimes more,
          sometimes less, is laid claim to by the purely objective. In the
          contrast of Tasso and Antonio, Goethe has illustrated the
          opposition, here explained in the abstract, in which these two
          entirely different kinds of capacity stand to each other. The
          kinship of genius and madness, so often observed, depends chiefly
          upon that separation of the intellect from the will which is
          essential to genius, but is yet contrary to nature. But this
          separation itself is by no means to be attributed to the fact that
          genius is accompanied by less intensity of will; for it is rather
          distinguished by a vehement and passionate character; but it is to
          be explained from this, that the practically excellent person, the
          man of deeds, has merely the whole, full measure of intellect
          required for an energetic will while most men lack even this; but
          genius consists in a completely abnormal, actual superfluity of
          intellect, such as is required for the service of no will. On this
          account the men of genuine works are a thousand times rarer than
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page154">[pg 154]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg154"></a> the men of deeds. It
          is just that abnormal superfluity of intellect by virtue of which
          it obtains the decided preponderance, sets itself free from the
          will, and now, forgetting its origin, is freely active from its own
          strength and elasticity; and from this the creations of genius
          proceed.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now further,
          just this, that genius in working consists of the free intellect,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, of the intellect
          emancipated from the service of the will, has as a consequence that
          its productions serve no useful ends. The work of genius is music,
          or philosophy, or paintings, or poetry; it is nothing to use. To be
          of no use belongs to the character of the works of genius; it is
          their patent of nobility. All other works of men are for the
          maintenance or easing of our existence; only those we are speaking
          of are not; they alone exist for their own sake, and are in this
          sense to be regarded as the flower or the net profit of existence.
          Therefore our heart swells at the enjoyment of them, for we rise
          out of the heavy earthly atmosphere of want. Analogous to this, we
          see the beautiful, even apart from these, rarely combined with the
          useful. Lofty and beautiful trees bear no fruit; the fruit-trees
          are small, ugly cripples. The full garden rose is not fruitful, but
          the small, wild, almost scentless roses are. The most beautiful
          buildings are not the useful ones; a temple is no dwelling-house. A
          man of high, rare mental endowments compelled to apply himself to a
          merely useful business, for which the most ordinary man would be
          fitted, is like a costly vase decorated with the most beautiful
          painting which is used as a kitchen pot; and to compare useful
          people with men of genius is like comparing building-stone with
          diamonds.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus the merely
          practical man uses his intellect for that for which nature destined
          it, the comprehension of the relations of things, partly to each
          other, partly to the will of the knowing individual. The genius, on
          the other hand, uses it, contrary to its destination, for the
          comprehension of the objective nature of things. His mind,
          therefore, belongs not to himself, but to the world, to the
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page155">[pg 155]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg155"></a> illumination of
          which, in some sense, it will contribute. From this must spring
          manifold <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">disadvantages</span></em> to the individual
          favoured with genius. For his intellect will in general show those
          faults which are rarely wanting in any tool which is used for that
          for which it has not been made. First of all, it will be, as it
          were, the servant of two masters, for on every opportunity it frees
          itself from the service to which it was destined in order to follow
          its own ends, whereby it often leaves the will very inopportunely
          in a fix, and thus the individual so gifted becomes more or less
          useless for life, nay, in his conduct sometimes reminds us of
          madness. Then, on account of its highly developed power of
          knowledge, it will see in things more the universal than the
          particular; while the service of the will principally requires the
          knowledge of the particular. But, again, when, as opportunity
          offers, that whole abnormally heightened power of knowledge directs
          itself with all its energy to the circumstances and miseries of the
          will, it will be apt to apprehend these too vividly, to behold all
          in too glaring colours, in too bright a light, and in a fearfully
          exaggerated form, whereby the individual falls into mere extremes.
          The following may serve to explain this more accurately. All great
          theoretical achievements, in whatever sphere they may be, are
          brought about in this way: Their author directs all the forces of
          his mind upon one point, in which he lets them unite and
          concentrate so strongly, firmly, and exclusively that now the whole
          of the rest of the world vanishes for him, and his object fills all
          reality. Now this great and powerful concentration which belongs to
          the privileges of genius sometimes appears for it also in the case
          of objects of the real world and the events of daily life, which
          then, brought under such a focus, are magnified to such a monstrous
          extent that they appear like the flea, which under the solar
          microscope assumes the stature of an elephant. Hence it arises that
          highly gifted individuals sometimes are thrown by trifles into
          violent emotions of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page156">[pg
          156]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg156"></a>
          the most various kinds, which are incomprehensible to others, who
          see them transported with grief, joy, care, fear, anger, &amp;c.,
          by things which leave the every-day man quite composed. Thus, then,
          the genius lacks <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">soberness</span></em>, which simply consists
          in this, that one sees in things nothing more than actually belongs
          to them, especially with reference to our possible ends; therefore
          no sober-minded man can be a genius. With the disadvantages which
          have been enumerated there is also associated hyper-sensibility,
          which an abnormally developed nervous and cerebral system brings
          with it, and indeed in union with the vehemence and passionateness
          of will which is certainly characteristic of genius, and which
          exhibits itself physically as energy of the pulsation of the heart.
          From all this very easily arises that extravagance of disposition,
          that vehemence of the emotions, that quick change of mood under
          prevailing melancholy, which Goethe has presented to us in Tasso.
          What reasonableness, quiet composure, finished surveyal, certainty
          and proportionateness of behaviour is shown by the well-endowed
          normal man in comparison with the now dreamy absentness, and now
          passionate excitement of the man of genius, whose inward pain is
          the mother's lap of immortal works! To all this must still be added
          that genius lives essentially alone. It is too rare to find its
          like with ease, and too different from the rest of men to be their
          companion. With them it is the will, with him it is knowledge, that
          predominates; therefore their pleasures are not his, and his are
          not theirs. They are merely moral beings, and have merely personal
          relations; he is at the same time a pure intellect, and as such
          belongs to the whole of humanity. The course of thought of the
          intellect which is detached from its mother soil, the will, and
          only returns to it periodically, will soon show itself entirely
          different from that of the normal intellect, still cleaving to its
          stem. For this reason, and also on account of the dissimilarity of
          the pace, the former is not adapted <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page157">[pg 157]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg157"></a> for thinking in common, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          for conversation with the others: they will have as little pleasure
          in him and his oppressive superiority as he will in them. They will
          therefore feel more comfortable with their equals, and he will
          prefer the entertainment of his equals, although, as a rule, this
          is only possible through the works they have left behind them.
          Therefore Chamfort says very rightly: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">Il y a peu de vices qui
          empêchent un homme d'avoir beaucoup d'amis, autant que peuvent le
          faire de trop grandes qualités</span></span>.”</span> The happiest
          lot that can fall to the genius is release from action, which is
          not his element, and leisure for production. From all this it
          results that although genius may highly bless him who is gifted
          with it, in the hours in which, abandoned to it, he revels
          unhindered in its delight, yet it is by no means fitted to procure
          for him a happy course of life; rather the contrary. This is also
          confirmed by the experience recorded in biographies. Besides this
          there is also an external incongruity, for the genius, in his
          efforts and achievements themselves, is for the most part in
          contradiction and conflict with his age. Mere men of talent come
          always at the right time; for as they are roused by the spirit of
          their age, and called forth by its needs, they are also capable
          only of satisfying these. They therefore go hand in hand with the
          advancing culture of their contemporaries or with the gradual
          progress of a special science: for this they reap reward and
          approval. But to the next generation their works are no longer
          enjoyable; they must be replaced by others, which again are not
          permanent. The genius, on the contrary, comes into his age like a
          comet into the paths of the planets, to whose well-regulated and
          comprehensible order its entirely eccentric course is foreign.
          Accordingly he cannot go hand in hand with the existing, regular
          progress of the culture of the age, but flings his works far out on
          to the way in front (as the dying emperor flung his spear among the
          enemy), upon which time has first to overtake them. His relation
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page158">[pg 158]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg158"></a> to the culminating
          men of talent of his time might be expressed in the words of the
          Evangelist: <span class="tei tei-q">“Ὁ καιρος ὁ εμος ουπω παρεστιν;
          ὁ δε καιρος ὁ ὑμετερος παντοτε εστιν ἑτοιμος”</span> (John vii. 6).
          The man of talent can achieve what is beyond the power of
          achievement of other men, but not what is beyond their power of
          apprehension: therefore he at once finds those who prize him. But
          the achievement of the man of genius, on the contrary, transcends
          not only the power of achievement, but also the power of
          apprehension of others; therefore they do not become directly
          conscious of him. The man of talent is like the marksman who hits a
          mark the others cannot hit; the man of genius is like the marksman
          who hits a mark they cannot even see to; therefore they only get
          news of him indirectly, and thus late; and even this they only
          accept upon trust and faith. Accordingly Goethe says in one of his
          letters, <span class="tei tei-q">“Imitation is inborn in us; what
          to imitate is not easily recognised. Rarely is what is excellent
          found; still more rarely is it prized.”</span> And Chamfort says:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">Il en est de la
          valeur des hommes comme de celle des diamans, qui à une certaine
          mesure de grosseur, de pureté, de perfection, ont un prix fixe et
          marqué, mais qui, par-delà cette mesure, restent sans prix, et ne
          trouvent point d'acheteurs</span></span>.”</span> And Bacon of
          Verulam has also expressed it: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Infimarum virtutum, apud vulgus, laus est,
          mediarum admiratio, supremarum sensus nullus</span></span>”</span>
          (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De augm.
          sc.</span></span>, L. vi. c. 3). Indeed, one might perhaps reply,
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Apud vulgus!</span></span> But I must then
          come to his assistance with Machiavelli's assurance: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Nel mondo non è se non
          volgo</span></span>;”</span><a href="#note_12" id="noteref_12" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">12</span></span></a> as
          also Thilo (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ueber den Ruhm</span></span>) remarks, that to
          the vulgar herd there generally belongs one more than each of us
          believes. It is a consequence of this late recognition of the works
          of the man of genius that they are rarely enjoyed by their
          contemporaries, and accordingly in the freshness of colour which
          synchronism and presence imparts, but, like figs and dates, much
          more in a dry than in a fresh state.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page159">[pg 159]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg159"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If, finally, we
          consider genius from the somatic side, we find it conditioned by
          several anatomical and physiological qualities, which individually
          are seldom present in perfection, and still more seldom perfect
          together, but which are yet all indispensably required; so that
          this explains why genius only appears as a perfectly isolated and
          almost portentous exception. The fundamental condition is an
          abnormal predominance of sensibility over irritability and
          reproductive power; and what makes the matter more difficult, this
          must take place in a male body. (Women may have great talent, but
          no genius, for they always remain subjective.) Similarly the
          cerebral system must be perfectly separated from the ganglion
          system by complete isolation, so that it stands in complete
          opposition to the latter; and thus the brain pursues its parasitic
          life on the organism in a very decided, isolated, powerful, and
          independent manner. Certainly it will thereby very easily affect
          the rest of the organism injuriously, and through its heightened
          life and ceaseless activity wear it out prematurely, unless it is
          itself possessed of energetic vital force and a good constitution:
          thus the latter belong to the conditions of genius. Indeed even a
          good stomach is a condition on account of the special and close
          agreement of this part with the brain. But chiefly the brain must
          be of unusual development and magnitude, especially broad and high.
          On the other hand, its depth will be inferior, and the cerebrum
          will abnormally preponderate in proportion to the cerebellum.
          Without doubt much depends upon the configuration of the brain as a
          whole and in its parts; but our knowledge is not yet sufficient to
          determine this accurately, although we easily recognise the form of
          skull that indicates a noble and lofty intelligence. The texture of
          the mass of the brain must be of extreme fineness and perfection,
          and consist of the purest, most concentrated, tenderest, and most
          excitable nerve-substance; certainly the quantitative proportion of
          the white to the grey matter has a decided influence, which,
          however, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page160">[pg
          160]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg160"></a>
          we are also unable as yet to specify. However, the report of the
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">post-mortem</span></span> on the body of
          Byron<a href="#note_13" id="noteref_13" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">13</span></span></a> shows
          that in his case the white matter was in unusually large proportion
          to the grey, and also that his brain weighed six pounds. Cuvier's
          brain weighed five pounds; the normal weight is three pounds. In
          contrast to the superior size of the brain, the spinal cord and
          nerves must be unusually thin. A beautifully arched, high and broad
          skull of thin bone must protect the brain without in any way
          cramping it. This whole quality of the brain and nervous system is
          the inheritance from the mother, to which we shall return in the
          following book. But it is quite insufficient to produce the
          phenomenon of genius if the inheritance from the father is not
          added, a lively, passionate temperament, which exhibits itself
          somatically as unusual energy of the heart, and consequently of the
          circulation of the blood, especially towards the head. For, in the
          first place, that turgescence peculiar to the brain on account of
          which it presses against its walls is increased by this; therefore
          it forces itself out of any opening in these which has been
          occasioned by some injury; and secondly, from the requisite
          strength of the heart the brain receives that internal movement
          different from its constant rising and sinking at every breath,
          which consists in a shaking of its whole mass at every pulsation of
          the four cerebral arteries, and the energy of which must correspond
          to the here increased quantity of the brain, as this movement in
          general is an indispensable condition of its activity. To this,
          therefore, small stature and especially a short neck is favourable,
          because by the shorter path the blood reaches the brain with more
          energy; and on this account great minds have seldom large bodies.
          Yet that shortness of the distance is not indispensable; for
          example, Goethe was of more than middle height. If, however, the
          whole condition connected with the circulation of the blood, and
          therefore coming <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page161">[pg
          161]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg161"></a>
          from the father is wanting, the good quality of the brain coming
          from the mother, will at most produce a man of talent, a fine
          understanding, which the phlegmatic temperament thus introduced
          supports; but a phlegmatic genius is impossible. This condition
          coming from the father explains many faults of temperament
          described above. But, on the other hand, if this condition exists
          without the former, thus with an ordinarily or even badly
          constructed brain, it gives vivacity without mind, heat without
          light, hot-headed persons, men of unsupportable restlessness and
          petulance. That of two brothers only one has genius, and that one
          generally the elder, as, for example, in Kant's case, is primarily
          to be explained from the fact that the father was at the age of
          strength and passion only when he was begotten; although also the
          other condition originating with the mother may be spoiled by
          unfavourable circumstances.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I have further
          to add here a special remark on the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">childlike</span></em> character of the genius,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, on a certain resemblance
          which exists between genius and the age of childhood. In childhood,
          as in the case of genius, the cerebral and nervous system decidedly
          preponderates, for its development hurries far in advance of that
          of the rest of the organism; so that already at the seventh year
          the brain has attained its full extension and mass. Therefore,
          Bichat says: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">Dans l'enfance le système nerveux, comparé au
          musculaire, est proportionellement plus considérable que dans tous
          les âges suivans, tandis que par la suite, la pluspart des autres
          systèmes prédominent sur celui-ci. On sait que, pour bien voir les
          nerfs, on choisit toujours les enfans</span></span>”</span>
          (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De la
          vie et de la mort</span></span>, art. 8, § 6). On the other hand,
          the development of the genital system begins latest, and
          irritability, reproduction, and genital function are in full force
          only at the age of manhood, and then, as a rule, they predominate
          over the brain function. Hence it is explicable that children, in
          general, are so sensible, reasonable, desirous of information, and
          teachable, nay, on the whole, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page162">[pg 162]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg162"></a> are more disposed and fitted for all
          theoretical occupation than grown-up people. They have, in
          consequence of that course of development, more intellect than
          will, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, than inclinations, desire,
          and passion. For intellect and brain are one, and so also is the
          genital system one with the most vehement of all desires: therefore
          I have called the latter the focus of the will. Just because the
          fearful activity of this system still slumbers, while that of the
          brain has already full play, childhood is the time of innocence and
          happiness, the paradise of life, the lost Eden on which we look
          longingly back through the whole remaining course of our life. But
          the basis of that happiness is that in childhood our whole
          existence lies much more in knowing than in willing—a condition
          which is also supported from without by the novelty of all objects.
          Hence in the morning sunshine of life the world lies before us so
          fresh, so magically gleaming, so attractive. The small desires, the
          weak inclinations, and trifling cares of childhood are only a weak
          counterpoise to that predominance of intellectual activity. The
          innocent and clear glance of children, at which we revive
          ourselves, and which sometimes in particular cases reaches the
          sublime contemplative expression with which Raphael has glorified
          his cherubs, is to be explained from what has been said.
          Accordingly the mental powers develop much earlier than the needs
          they are destined to serve; and here, as everywhere, nature
          proceeds very designedly. For in this time of predominating
          intelligence the man collects a great store of knowledge for future
          wants which at the time are foreign to him. Therefore his
          intellect, now unceasingly active, eagerly apprehends all
          phenomena, broods over them and stores them up carefully for the
          coming time,—like the bees, who gather a great deal more honey than
          they can consume, in anticipation of future need. Certainly what a
          man acquires of insight and knowledge up to the age of puberty is,
          taken as a whole, more than all that he afterwards learns, however
          learned he may become; <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page163">[pg
          163]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg163"></a>
          for it is the foundation of all human knowledge. Up till the same
          time plasticity predominates in the child's body, and later, by a
          metastasis, its forces throw themselves into the system of
          generation; and thus with puberty the sexual passion appears, and
          now, little by little, the will gains the upper hand. Then
          childhood, which is prevailingly theoretical and desirous of
          learning, is followed by the restless, now stormy, now melancholy,
          period of youth, which afterwards passes into the vigorous and
          earnest age of manhood. Just because that impulse pregnant with
          evil is wanting in the child is its volition so adapted and
          subordinated to knowledge, whence arises that character of
          innocence, intelligence, and reasonableness which is peculiar to
          the age of childhood. On what, then, the likeness between childhood
          and genius depends I scarcely need to express further: upon the
          surplus of the powers of knowledge over the needs of the will, and
          the predominance of the purely intellectual activity which springs
          from this. Really every child is to a certain extent a genius, and
          the genius is to a certain extent a child. The relationship of the
          two shows itself primarily in the naïveté and sublime simplicity
          which is characteristic of true genius; and besides this it appears
          in several traits, so that a certain childishness certainly belongs
          to the character of the genius. In Riemer's <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mittheilungen über
          Goethe</span></span>”</span> (vol. i. p. 184) it is related that
          Herder and others found fault with Goethe, saying he was always a
          big child. Certainly they were right in what they said, but they
          were not right in finding fault with it. It has also been said of
          Mozart that all his life he remained a child (Nissen's Biography of
          Mozart, p. 2 and 529). Schlichtegroll's <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Nekrology</span></span>”</span> (for 1791,
          vol. ii. p. 109) says of him: <span class="tei tei-q">“In his art
          he early became a man, but in all other relations he always
          remained a child.”</span> Every genius is even for this reason a
          big child; he looks out into the world as into something strange, a
          play, and therefore with purely objective interest. Accordingly
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page164">[pg 164]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg164"></a> he has just as
          little as the child that dull gravity of ordinary men, who, since
          they are capable only of subjective interests, always see in things
          mere motives for their action. Whoever does not to a certain extent
          remain all his life a big child, but becomes a grave, sober,
          thoroughly composed, and reasonable man, may be a very useful and
          capable citizen of this world; but never a genius. In fact, the
          genius is so because that predominance of the sensible system and
          of intellectual activity which is natural to childhood maintains
          itself in him in an abnormal manner through his whole life, thus
          here becomes perennial. A trace of this certainly shows itself in
          many ordinary men up to the period of their youth; therefore, for
          example, in many students a purely intellectual tendency and an
          eccentricity suggestive of genius is unmistakable. But nature
          returns to her track; they assume the chrysalis form and reappear
          at the age of manhood, as incarnate Philistines, at whom we are
          startled when we meet them again in later years. Upon all this that
          has been expounded here depends Goethe's beautiful remark:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Children do not perform what they promise;
          young people very seldom; and if they do keep their word, the world
          does not keep its word with them”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Wahlverwandtschaften</span></span>, Pt. i. ch.
          10)—the world which afterwards bestows the crowns which it holds
          aloft for merit on those who are the tools of its low aims or know
          how to deceive it. In accordance with what has been said, as there
          is a mere beauty of youth, which almost every one at some time
          possesses (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">beauté du diable</span></span>), so there is a
          mere intellectuality of youth, a certain mental nature disposed and
          adapted for apprehending, understanding, and learning, which every
          one has in childhood, and some have still in youth, but which is
          afterwards lost, just like that beauty. Only in the case of a very
          few, the chosen, the one, like the other, lasts through the whole
          life; so that even in old age a trace of it still remains visible:
          these are the truly beautiful and the men of true
          genius.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page165">[pg

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The predominance
          of the cerebral nervous system and of intelligence in childhood,
          which is here under consideration, together with the decline of it
          in riper age, receives important illustration and confirmation from
          the fact that in the species of animals which stands nearest to
          man, the apes, the same relation is found in a striking degree. It
          has by degrees become certain that the highly intelligent
          orang-outang is a young pongo, which when it has grown up loses the
          remarkable human look of its countenance, and also its astonishing
          intelligence, because the lower and brutal part of its face
          increases in size, the forehead thereby recedes, large <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">cristæ</span></span>, muscular developments,
          give the skull a brutish form, the activity of the nervous system
          sinks, and in its place extraordinary muscular strength develops,
          which, as it is sufficient for its preservation, makes the great
          intelligence now superfluous. Especially important is what Fréd.
          Cuvier has said in this reference, and Flourens has illustrated in
          a review of the <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Histoire
          Naturelle</span></span>”</span> of the former, which appeared in
          the September number of the <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Journal des
          Savans</span></span>”</span> of 1839, and was also separately
          printed with some additions, under the title, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Résumé analytique des observations de Fr.

          jeune, nous étonne par sa pénétration, par sa ruse, par son

          étroite, qui leur est fixée, et à qui il suffit en quelque sorte de
          pouvoir veiller à leur conservation. Pour cela l'intelligence était

          This last confirms my principle that the intellect, like the claws
          and teeth, is nothing else than a weapon in the service of the
          will.</p>

<span style="font-size: 144%">On Madness.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The health of
          the mind properly consists in perfect recollection. Of course this
          is not to be understood as meaning that our memory preserves
          everything. For the past course of our life shrinks up in time, as
          the path of the wanderer looking back shrinks up in space:
          sometimes it is difficult for us to distinguish the particular
          years; the days have for the most part become unrecognisable.
          Really, however, only the exactly similar events, recurring an
          innumerable number of times, so that their images, as it were,
          conceal each other, ought so to run together in the memory that
          they are individually unrecognisable; on the other hand, every
          event in any way peculiar or significant we must be able to find
          again in memory, if the intellect is normal, vigorous, and quite
          healthy. In the text I have explained <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">madness</span></em>
          as the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">broken thread</span></em> of this memory,
          which still runs on regularly, although in constantly decreasing
          fulness and distinctness. The following considerations may serve to
          confirm this.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The memory of a
          healthy man affords a certainty as to an event he has witnessed,
          which is regarded as just as firm and sure as his present
          apprehension of things; therefore, if sworn to by him, this event
          is thereby established in a court of law. On the other hand, the
          mere suspicion of madness will at once weaken the testimony
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page168">[pg 168]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg168"></a> of a witness. Here,
          then, lies the criterion between the healthy mind and insanity.
          Whenever I doubt whether an event which I remember really took
          place, I throw upon myself the suspicion of madness: unless it is
          that I am uncertain whether it was not a mere dream. If another
          doubts the reality of an event, related by me as an eye-witness,
          without mistrusting my honesty, then he regards me as insane.
          Whoever comes at last, through constantly recounting an event which
          originally was fabricated by him, to believe in it himself is, in
          this one point, really insane. We may ascribe to an insane person
          flashes of wit, single clever thoughts, even correct judgments, but
          his testimony as to past events no man will consider valid. In the
          Lalita-vistara, well known to be the history of Buddha Sakya-Muni,
          it is related that at the moment of his birth all the sick became
          well, all the blind saw, all the deaf heard, and all mad people
          <span class="tei tei-q">“recovered their memory.”</span> This last
          is mentioned in two passages.<a href="#note_15" id="noteref_15" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">15</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">My own
          experience of many years has led me to the opinion that madness
          occurs proportionally most frequently among actors. But what a
          misuse they make of their memory! Daily they have to learn a new
          part or refresh an old one; but these parts are entirely without
          connection, nay, are in contradiction and contrast with each other,
          and every evening the actor strives to forget himself entirely and
          be some quite different person. This kind of thing paves the way
          for madness.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The exposition
          of the origin of madness given in the text will become more
          comprehensible if it is remembered how unwillingly we think of
          things which powerfully injure our interests, wound our pride, or
          interfere with our wishes; with what difficulty do we determine to
          lay such things before our own intellect for careful and serious
          investigation; how easily, on the other hand, we unconsciously
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page169">[pg 169]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg169"></a> break away or sneak
          off from them again; how, on the contrary, agreeable events come
          into our minds of their own accord, and, if driven away, constantly
          creep in again, so that we dwell on them for hours together. In
          that resistance of the will to allowing what is contrary to it to
          come under the examination of the intellect lies the place at which
          madness can break in upon the mind. Each new adverse event must be
          assimilated by the intellect, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, it must receive a place in
          the system of the truths connected with our will and its interests,
          whatever it may have to displace that is more satisfactory.
          Whenever this has taken place, it already pains us much less; but
          this operation itself is often very painful, and also, in general,
          only takes place slowly and with resistance. However, the health of
          the mind can only continue so long as this is in each case properly
          carried out. If, on the contrary, in some particular case, the
          resistance and struggles of the will against the apprehension of
          some knowledge reaches such a degree that that operation is not
          performed in its integrity, then certain events or circumstances
          become for the intellect completely suppressed, because the will
          cannot endure the sight of them, and then, for the sake of the
          necessary connection, the gaps that thus arise are filled up at
          pleasure; thus madness appears. For the intellect has given up its
          nature to please the will: the man now imagines what does not
          exist. Yet the madness which has thus arisen is now the lethe of
          unendurable suffering; it was the last remedy of harassed nature,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, of the will.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Let me mention
          here in passing a proof of my view which is worth noticing. Carlo
          Gozzi, in the <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Monstro
          turchino</span></span>,”</span> act i. scene 2, presents to us a
          person who has drunk a magic potion which produces forgetfulness,
          and this person appears exactly like a madman.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In accordance
          with the above exposition one may thus regard the origin of madness
          as a violent <span class="tei tei-q">“casting out of the
          mind”</span> of anything, which, however, is only possible
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page170">[pg 170]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg170"></a> by <span class="tei tei-q">“taking into the head”</span> something else. The
          converse process is more rare, that the <span class="tei tei-q">“taking into the head”</span> comes first, and the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“casting out of the mind”</span> second. It
          takes place, however, in those cases in which the occasion of
          insanity is kept constantly present to the mind and cannot be
          escaped from; thus, for example, in the case of many who have gone
          mad from love, erotomaniacs, where the occasion of their madness is
          constantly longed after; also in the case of madness which has
          resulted from the fright of some sudden horrible occurrence. Such
          patients cling, as it were, convulsively to the thought they have
          grasped, so that no other, or at least none opposed to it, can
          arise. In both processes, however, what is essential to madness
          remains the same, the impossibility of a uniformly connected
          recollection, such as is the basis of our healthy and rational
          reflection. Perhaps the contrast of the ways in which they arise,
          set forth here, might, if applied with judgment, afford a sharp and
          profound principle of division of delusions proper.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For the rest, I
          have only considered the physical origin of madness, thus what is
          introduced by external, objective occasions. More frequently,
          however, it depends upon purely physical causes, upon malformations
          or partial disorganisation of the brain or its membranes, also upon
          the influence which other parts affected with disease exercise upon
          the brain. Principally in the latter kind of madness false
          sense-perceptions, hallucinations, may arise. Yet the two causes of
          madness will generally partake of each other, particularly the
          psychical of the physical. It is the same as with suicide, which is
          rarely brought about by an external occasion alone, but a certain
          physical discomfort lies at its foundation; and according to the
          degree which this attains to a greater or less external occasion is
          required; only in the case of the very highest degree is no
          external occasion at all required. Therefore there is no misfortune
          so great that it would influence every one to suicide, and none so
          small that one like it has not already <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page171">[pg 171]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg171"></a> led to it. I have shown the psychical origin
          of madness as, at least according to all appearance, it is brought
          about in the healthy mind by a great misfortune. In the case of
          those who are already strongly disposed to madness physically a
          very small disappointment will be sufficient to induce it. For
          example, I remember a man in a madhouse who had been a soldier, and
          had gone out of his mind because his officer had addressed him as
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">Er</span></span>.<a href="#note_16" id="noteref_16" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">16</span></span></a> In the
          case of decided physical disposition no occasion at all is required
          when this has come to maturity. The madness which has sprung from
          purely psychical causes may, perhaps, by the violent perversion of
          the course of thought which has produced it, also introduce a kind
          of paralysis or other depravity of some part of the brain, which,
          if not soon done away with, becomes permanent. Therefore madness is
          only curable at first, and not after a longer time.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Pinel taught
          that there is a <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">mania sine delirio</span></span>, frenzy
          without insanity. This was controverted by Esquirol, and since then
          much has been said for and against it. The question can only be
          decided empirically. But if such a state really does occur, then it
          is to be explained from the fact that here the will periodically
          entirely withdraws itself from the government and guidance of the
          intellect, and consequently of motives, and thus it then appears as
          a blind, impetuous, destructive force of nature, and accordingly
          manifests itself as the desire to annihilate everything that comes
          in its way. The will thus let loose is like the stream which has
          broken through the dam, the horse that has thrown his rider, or a
          clock out of which the regulating screws have been taken. Yet only
          the reason, thus <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">reflective</span></em> knowledge, is included
          in that suspension, not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intuitive</span></em> knowledge also;
          otherwise the will would remain entirely without guidance, and
          consequently the man would be immovable. But, on the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page172">[pg 172]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg172"></a> contrary, the man in a frenzy
          apprehends objects, for he breaks out upon them; thus he has also
          consciousness of his present action, and afterwards remembrance of
          it. But he is entirely without reflection, thus without any
          guidance of the reason, consequently quite incapable of any
          consideration or regard for the present, the past, or the future.
          When the attack is over, and the reason has regained its command,
          its function is correct, because here its proper activity has not
          been perverted or destroyed, but only the will has found the means
          to withdraw itself from it entirely for a while.</p>

<span style="font-size: 144%">Isolated Remarks On Natural
          Beauty.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What contributes
          among other things to make the sight of a beautiful landscape so
          exceedingly delightful is the perfect <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">truth and
          consistency</span></em> of nature. Certainly nature does not follow
          here the guidance of logic in the connection of the grounds of
          knowledge, of antecedents and consequences, premisses and
          conclusions; but still it follows what is for it analogous to the
          law of causality in the visible connection of causes and effects.
          Every modification, even the slightest, which an object receives
          from its position, foreshortening, concealment, distance, lighting,
          linear and atmospheric perspective, &amp;c., is, through its effect
          upon the eye, unerringly given and accurately taken account of: the
          Indian proverb, <span class="tei tei-q">“Every corn of rice casts
          its shadow,”</span> finds here its confirmation. Therefore here
          everything shows itself so consistent, accurately regular,
          connected, and scrupulously right; here there are no evasions. If
          now we consider the sight of a beautiful view, merely as a
          brain-phenomenon, it is the only one among the complicated
          brain-phenomena which is always absolutely regular, blameless, and
          perfect; all the rest, especially our own mental operations, are,
          in form or material, affected more or less with defects or
          inaccuracies. From this excellence of the sight of beautiful
          nature, is the harmonious and thoroughly satisfying character of
          its impression to be explained, and also the favourable effect
          which <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page174">[pg 174]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg174"></a> it has upon our
          whole thought, which in its formal part thereby becomes more
          correctly disposed, and to a certain extent purified, for that
          brain-phenomenon which alone is entirely faultless sets the brain
          in general in perfectly normal action; and now the thought seeks to
          follow that method of nature in the consistency, connectedness,
          regularity, and harmony of all its processes, after being brought
          by it into the right swing. A beautiful view is therefore a
          cathartic of the mind, as music, according to Aristotle, is of the
          feeling, and in its presence one will think most correctly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That the sight
          of a mountain chain suddenly rising before us throws us so easily
          into a serious, and even sublime mood may partly depend upon the
          fact that the form of the mountains and the outline of the chain
          arising from it is the only constantly <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">permanent</span></em> line of the landscape,
          for the mountains alone defy the decay which soon sweeps away
          everything else, especially our own ephemeral person. Not that at
          the sight of the mountain chain all this appeared distinctly in our
          consciousness, but an obscure feeling of it is the fundamental note
          of our mood.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I would like to
          know why it is that while for the human form and countenance light
          from above is altogether the most advantageous, and light from
          below the most unfavourable, with regard to landscape nature
          exactly the converse holds good.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yet how æsthetic
          is nature! Every spot that is entirely uncultivated and wild,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, left free to itself,
          however small it may be, if only the hand of man remains absent, it
          decorates at once in the most tasteful manner, clothes it with
          plants, flowers, and shrubs, whose unforced nature, natural grace,
          and tasteful grouping bears witness that they have not grown up
          under the rod of correction of the great egoist, but that nature
          has here moved freely. Every neglected plant at once becomes
          beautiful. Upon this rests the principle of the English garden,
          which is as <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page175">[pg
          175]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg175"></a>
          much as possible to conceal art, so that it may appear as if nature
          had here moved freely; for only then is it perfectly beautiful,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, shows in the greatest
          distinctness the objectification of the still unconscious will to
          live, which here unfolds itself with the greatest naïveté, because
          the forms are not, as in the animal world, determined by external
          ends, but only immediately by the soil, climate, and a mysterious
          third influence on account of which so many plants which have
          originally sprung up in the same soil and climate yet show such
          different forms and characters.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The great
          difference between the English, or more correctly the Chinese,
          garden and the old French, which is now always becoming more rare,
          yet still exists in a few magnificent examples, ultimately rests
          upon the fact that the former is planned in an objective spirit,
          the latter in a subjective. In the former the will of nature, as it
          objectifies itself in tree and shrub, mountain and waterfall, is
          brought to the purest possible expression of these its Ideas, thus
          of its own inner being. In the French garden, on the other hand,
          only the will of the possessor of it is mirrored, which has subdued
          nature so that instead of its Ideas it bears as tokens of its
          slavery the forms which correspond to that will, and which are
          forcibly imposed upon it—clipped hedges, trees cut into all kinds
          of forms, straight alleys, arched avenues, &amp;c.</p>

<span style="font-size: 144%">On The Inner Nature Of
          Art.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Not merely
          philosophy but also the fine arts work at bottom towards the
          solution of the problem of existence. For in every mind that once
          gives itself up to the purely objective contemplation of nature a
          desire has been excited, however concealed and unconscious it may
          be, to comprehend the true nature of things, of life and existence.
          For this alone has interest for the intellect as such, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          for the pure subject of knowledge which has become free from the
          aims of the will; as for the subject which knows as a mere
          individual the aims of the will alone have interest. On this
          account the result of the purely objective apprehension of things
          is an expression more of the nature of life and existence, more an
          answer to the question, <span class="tei tei-q">“What is
          life?”</span> Every genuine and successful work of art answers this
          question in its own way with perfect correctness. But all the arts
          speak only the naive and childish language of perception, not the
          abstract and serious language of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">reflection</span></em>; their answer is
          therefore a fleeting image: not permanent and general knowledge.
          Thus for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">perception</span></em> every work of art
          answers that question, every painting, every statue, every poem,
          every scene upon the stage: music also answers it; and indeed more
          profoundly than all the rest, for in its language, which is
          understood with absolute directness, but which is yet
          untranslatable into that of the reason, the inner <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page177">[pg 177]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg177"></a> nature of all life and existence
          expresses itself. Thus all the other arts hold up to the questioner
          a perceptible image, and say, <span class="tei tei-q">“Look here,
          this is life.”</span> Their answer, however correct it may be, will
          yet always afford merely a temporary, not a complete and final,
          satisfaction. For they always give merely a fragment, an example
          instead of the rule, not the whole, which can only be given in the
          universality of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">conception</span></em>. For this, therefore,
          thus for reflection and in the abstract, to give an answer which
          just on that account shall be permanent and suffice for always, is
          the task of philosophy. However, we see here upon what the
          relationship of philosophy to the fine arts rests, and can conclude
          from that to what extent the capacity of both, although in its
          direction and in secondary matters very different, is yet in its
          root the same.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Every work of
          art accordingly really aims at showing us life and things as they
          are in truth, but cannot be directly discerned by every one through
          the mist of objective and subjective contingencies. Art takes away
          this mist.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The works of the
          poets, sculptors, and representative artists in general contain an
          unacknowledged treasure of profound wisdom; just because out of
          them the wisdom of the nature of things itself speaks, whose
          utterances they merely interpret by illustrations and purer
          repetitions. On this account, however, every one who reads the poem
          or looks at the picture must certainly contribute out of his own
          means to bring that wisdom to light; accordingly he comprehends
          only so much of it as his capacity and culture admit of; as in the
          deep sea each sailor only lets down the lead as far as the length
          of the line will allow. Before a picture, as before a prince, every
          one must stand, waiting to see whether and what it will speak to
          him; and, as in the case of a prince, so here he must not himself
          address it, for then he would only hear himself. It follows from
          all this that in the works of the representative arts all truth is
          certainly contained, yet only <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">virtualiter</span></span> or <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">implicite</span></span>; philosophy, on the
          other hand, endeavours to supply <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page178">[pg 178]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg178"></a> the same truth <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">actualiter</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">explicite</span></span>, and therefore, in
          this sense, is related to art as wine to grapes. What it promises
          to supply would be, as it were, an already realised and clear gain,
          a firm and abiding possession; while that which proceeds from the
          achievements and works of art is one which has constantly to be
          reproduced anew. Therefore, however, it makes demands, not only
          upon those who produce its works, but also upon those who are to
          enjoy them which are discouraging and hard to comply with.
          Therefore its public remains small, while that of art is large.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The co-operation
          of the beholder, which is referred to above, as demanded for the
          enjoyment of a work of art, depends partly upon the fact that every
          work of art can only produce its effect through the medium of the
          fancy; therefore it must excite this, and can never allow it to be
          left out of the play and remain inactive. This is a condition of
          the æsthetic effect, and therefore a fundamental law of all fine
          arts. But it follows from this that, through the work of art,
          everything must not be directly given to the senses, but rather
          only so much as is demanded to lead the fancy on to the right path;
          something, and indeed the ultimate thing, must always be left over
          for the fancy to do. Even the author must always leave something
          over for the reader to think; for Voltaire has very rightly said,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">Le secret d'être
          ennuyeux, c'est de tout dire</span></span>.”</span> But besides
          this, in art the best of all is too spiritual to be given directly
          to the senses; it must be born in the imagination of the beholder,
          although begotten by the work of art. It depends upon this that the
          sketches of great masters often effect more than their finished
          pictures; although another advantage certainly contributes to this,
          namely, that they are completed offhand in the moment of
          conception; while the perfected painting is only produced through
          continued effort, by means of skilful deliberation and persistent
          intention, for the inspiration cannot last till it is completed.
          From the fundamental æsthetical law we are speaking of, it is
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page179">[pg 179]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg179"></a> further to be
          explained why wax figures never produce an æsthetic effect, and
          therefore are not properly works of fine art, although it is just
          in them that the imitation of nature is able to reach its highest
          grade. For they leave nothing for the imagination to do. Sculpture
          gives merely the form without the colour; painting gives the
          colour, but the mere appearance of the form; thus both appeal to
          the imagination of the beholder. The wax figure, on the other hand,
          gives all, form and colour at once; whence arises the appearance of
          reality, and the imagination is left out of account. Poetry, on the
          contrary, appeals indeed to the imagination alone, which it sets in
          action by means of mere words.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">An arbitrary
          playing with the means of art without a proper knowledge of the end
          is, in every art, the fundamental characteristic of the dabbler.
          Such a man shows himself in the pillars that support nothing,
          aimless volutes, juttings and projections of bad architecture, in
          the meaningless runs and figures, together with the aimless noise
          of bad music, in the jingling of the rhymes of senseless poetry,
          &amp;c.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It follows from
          the preceding chapter, and from my whole view of art, that its aim
          is the facilitating of the knowledge of the Ideas of the world (in
          the Platonic sense, the only one which I recognise for the word
          Idea). The Ideas, however, are essentially something perceptible,
          which, therefore, in its fuller determinations, is inexhaustible.
          The communication of such an Idea can therefore only take place on
          the path of perception, which is that of art. Whoever, therefore,
          is filled with the comprehension of an Idea is justified if he
          chooses art as the medium of its communication. The mere
          conception, on the other hand, is something completely
          determinable, therefore exhaustible, and distinctly thought, the
          whole content of which can be coldly and dryly expressed in words.
          Now to desire to communicate such a conception by means of a work
          of art is a very useless circumlocution, indeed belongs to that
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page180">[pg 180]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg180"></a> playing with the
          means of art without knowledge of its end which has just been
          condemned. Therefore a work of art which has proceeded from mere
          distinct conceptions is always ungenuine. If now, in considering a
          work of plastic art, or in reading a poem, or in hearing a piece of
          music (which aims at describing something definite), we see,
          through all the rich materials of art, the distinct, limited, cold,
          dry conception shine out, and at last come to the front, the
          conception which was the kernel of this work, the whole notion of
          which consequently consisted in the distinct thinking of it, and
          accordingly is absolutely exhausted by its communication, we feel
          disgusted and indignant, for we see ourselves deceived and cheated
          out of our interest and attention. We are only perfectly satisfied
          by the impression of a work of art when it leaves something which,
          with all our thinking about it, we cannot bring down to the
          distinctness of a conception. The mark of that hybrid origin from
          mere conceptions is that the author of a work of art could, before
          he set about it, give in distinct words what he intended to
          present; for then it would have been possible to attain his whole
          end through these words. Therefore it is an undertaking as unworthy
          as it is absurd if, as has often been tried at the present day, one
          seeks to reduce a poem of Shakspeare's or Goethe's to the abstract
          truth which it was its aim to communicate. Certainly the artist
          ought to think in the arranging of his work; but only that thought
          which was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">perceived</span></em> before it was thought
          has afterwards, in its communication, the power of animating or
          rousing, and thereby becomes imperishable. We shall not refrain
          from observing here that certainly the work which is done at a
          stroke, like the sketches of painters already referred to, the work
          which is completed in the inspiration of its first conception, and
          as it were unconsciously dashed off, like the melody which comes
          entirely without reflection, and quite as if by inspiration, and
          finally, also the lyrical poem proper, the mere song, in which the
          deeply felt mood of the present, and the impression of the
          surroundings, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page181">[pg
          181]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg181"></a>
          as if involuntarily, pours itself forth in words, whose metre and
          rhyme come about of their own accord—that all these, I say, have
          the great advantage of being purely the work of the ecstasy of the
          moment, the inspiration, the free movement of genius, without any
          admixture of intention and reflection; hence they are through and
          through delightful and enjoyable, without shell and kernel, and
          their effect is much more inevitable than that of the greatest
          works of art, of slower and more deliberate execution. In all the
          latter, thus in great historical paintings, in long epic poems,
          great operas, &amp;c., reflection, intention, and deliberate
          selection has had an important part; understanding, technical
          skill, and routine must here fill up the gaps which the conception
          and inspiration of genius has left, and must mix with these all
          kinds of necessary supplementary work as cement of the only really
          genuinely brilliant parts. This explains why all such works, only
          excepting the perfect masterpieces of the very greatest masters
          (as, for example, <span class="tei tei-q">“Hamlet,”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Faust,”</span> the opera of <span class="tei tei-q">“Don Juan”</span>), inevitably contain an admixture of
          something insipid and wearisome, which in some measure hinders the
          enjoyment of them. Proofs of this are the <span class="tei tei-q">“Messiah,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gerusalemme
          liberata</span></span>,”</span> even <span class="tei tei-q">“Paradise Lost”</span> and the <span class="tei tei-q">“Æneid;”</span> and Horace already makes the bold
          remark, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Quandoque dormitat bonus
          Homerus</span></span>.”</span> But that this is the case is the
          consequence of the limitation of human powers in general.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The mother of
          the useful arts is necessity; that of the fine arts superfluity. As
          their father, the former have understanding; the latter genius,
          which is itself a kind of superfluity, that of the powers of
          knowledge beyond the measure which is required for the service of
          the will.</p>

<span style="font-size: 144%">On The Æsthetics Of
          Architecture.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In accordance
          with the deduction given in the text of the pure æsthetics of
          architecture from the lowest grades of the objectification of the
          will or of nature, the Ideas of which it seeks to bring to distinct
          perception, its one constant theme is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">support and
          burden</span></em>, and its fundamental law is that no burden shall
          be without sufficient support, and no support without a suitable
          burden; consequently that the relation of these two shall be
          exactly the fitting one. The purest example of the carrying out of
          this theme is the column and entablature. Therefore the order or
          columnar arrangement has become, as it were, the thorough bass of
          the whole of architecture. In column and entablature the support
          and the burden are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">completely separated</span></em>; whereby the
          reciprocal action of the two and their relation to each other
          becomes apparent. For certainly even every plain wall contains
          support and burden; but here the two are still fused together. All
          is here support and all is burden; hence there is no æsthetic
          effect. This first appears through the separation, and takes place
          in proportion to its degree. For between the row of columns and the
          plain wall there are many intermediate degrees. Even in the mere
          breaking up of the wall of a house by windows and doors one seeks
          at least to indicate that separation by flat projecting pilasters
          (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">antæ</span></span>) with capitals, which are
          inserted under the mouldings, nay, in case of need, are represented
          by mere painting, in order to indicate <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page183">[pg 183]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg183"></a> in some way the entablature and an order.
          Real pillars, and also consoles and supports of various kinds,
          realise more that pure separation of support and burden which is
          striven after throughout by architecture. In this respect, next to
          the column with the entablature, but as a special construction not
          imitating it, stands the vault with the pillar. The latter
          certainly is far from attaining to the æsthetic effect of the
          former, because here the support and the burden are not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">purely
          separated</span></em>, but are fused, passing over into each other.
          In the vault itself every stone is at once burden and support, and
          even the pillars, especially in groined vaulting, are, at least
          apparently, held in position by the pressure of opposite arches;
          and also just on account of this lateral pressure not only vaults
          but even mere arches ought not to rest upon columns, but require
          the massive four-cornered pillars. In the row of columns alone is
          the separation complete, for here the entablature appears as pure
          burden, the column as pure support. Accordingly the relation of the
          colonnade to the plain wall may be compared to that which would
          exist between a scale ascending in regular intervals and a tone
          ascending little by little from the same depth to the same height
          without gradation, which would produce a mere howl. For in the one
          as in the other the material is the same, and the important
          difference proceeds entirely from the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pure
          separation</span></em>.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Moreover, the
          support is not adapted to the burden when it is only sufficient to
          bear it, but when it can do this so conveniently and amply that at
          the first glance we are quite at ease about it. Yet this
          superfluity of support must not exceed a certain degree; for
          otherwise we will perceive support without burden, which is opposed
          to the æsthetic end. As a rule for determining that degree the
          ancients devised the line of equilibrium, which is got by carrying
          out the diminution of the thickness of the column as it ascends
          till it runs out into an acute angle, whereby the column becomes a
          cone; now every cross section will <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page184">[pg 184]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg184"></a> leave the lower part so strong that it is
          sufficient to support the upper part cut off. Commonly, however,
          one builds with twentyfold strength, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          one lays upon every support only 1/20th of the maximum it could
          bear. A glaring example of burden without support is presented to
          the eye by the balconies at the corners of many houses built in the
          elegant style of the present day. We do not see what supports them;
          they seem to hang suspended, and disturb the mind.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That in Italy
          even the simplest and most unornamented buildings make an æsthetic
          impression, while in Germany this is not the case, depends
          principally upon the fact that in Italy the roofs are very flat. A
          high roof is neither support nor burden, for its two halves
          mutually support each other, but the whole has no weight
          corresponding to its extension. Therefore it presents to the eye an
          extended mass which is entirely foreign to the æsthetic end, serves
          merely a useful end, consequently disturbs the former, of which the
          theme is always only support and burden.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The form of the
          column has its sole ground in the fact that it affords the simplest
          and most suitable support. In the twisted column inappropriateness
          appears as if with intentional perversity, and therefore
          shamelessness: hence good taste condemns it at the first glance.
          The four-cornered pillar, since the diagonal exceeds the sides, has
          unequal dimensions of thickness which have no end as their motive,
          but are occasioned by the accident of greater feasibleness; and
          just on this account it pleases us so very much less than the
          column. Even the hexagonal or octagonal pillar is more pleasing,
          because it approaches more nearly to the round column; for the form
          of the latter alone is exclusively determined by the end. It is,
          however, also so determined in all its other proportions, primarily
          in the relation of its thickness to its height, within the limits
          permitted by the difference of the three columnar orders. Therefore
          its diminution <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page185">[pg
          185]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg185"></a>
          from the first third of its height upwards, and also a slight
          increase of its thickness just at this place (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">entasis
          vitr.</span></span>), depends upon the fact that the pressure of
          the burden is greatest there. It has hitherto been believed that
          this increase in thickness was peculiar to the Ionic and Corinthian
          columns alone, but recent measurements have shown it also in the
          Doric columns, even at Pæstum. Thus everything in the column, its
          thoroughly determined form, the proportion of its height to its
          thickness, of both to the intervals between the columns, and that
          of the whole series to the entablature and the burden resting upon
          it, is the exactly calculated result of the relation of the
          necessary support to the given burden. As the latter is uniformly
          distributed, so must also the support be; therefore groups of
          columns are tasteless. On the other hand, in the best Doric temples
          the corner column comes somewhat nearer to the next ones, because
          the meeting of the entablatures at the corner increases the burden;
          and in this the principle of architecture expresses itself
          distinctly, that the structural relations, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          the relations between support and burden, are the essential ones,
          to which the relations of symmetry, as subordinate, must at once
          give way. According to the weight of the whole burden generally
          will the Doric or the two lighter orders of columns be chosen, for
          the first, not only by the greater thickness, but also by the
          closer position of the columns, which is essential to it, is
          calculated for heavier burdens, to which end also the almost crude
          simplicity of its capital is suited. The capitals in general serve
          the end of showing visibly that the columns bear the entablature,
          and are not stuck in like pins; at the same time they increase by
          means of their abacus the bearing surface. Since, then, all the
          laws of columnar arrangement, and consequently also the form and
          proportion of the column, in all its parts and dimensions down to
          the smallest details, follow from the thoroughly understood and
          consistently carried out conception of the amply adequate support
          of a given burden, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page186">[pg
          186]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg186"></a>
          thus so far are determined <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          priori</span></span>, it comes out clearly how perverse is the
          thought, so often repeated, that the stems of trees, or even (which
          unfortunately even <span class="tei tei-q">“Vitruvius,”</span> iv.
          1, expresses) the human form has been the prototype of the column.
          For if the form of the column were for architecture a purely
          accidental one, taken from without, it could never appeal to us so
          harmoniously and satisfactorily whenever we behold it in its proper
          symmetry; nor, on the other hand, could every even slight
          disproportion of it be felt at once by the fine and cultivated
          sense as disagreeable and disturbing, like a false note in music.
          This is rather only possible because, according to the given end
          and means, all the rest is essentially determined <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span>, as in music, according
          to the given melody and key, the whole harmony is essentially so
          determined. And, like music, architecture in general is also not an
          imitative art, although both are often falsely taken to be so.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Æsthetic
          satisfaction, as was fully explained in the text, always depends
          upon the apprehension of a (Platonic) Idea. For architecture,
          considered merely as a fine art, the Ideas of the lowest grades of
          nature, such as gravity, rigidity, and cohesion, are the peculiar
          theme; but not, as has hitherto been assumed, merely regular form,
          proportion, and symmetry, which, as something purely geometrical,
          properties of space, are not Ideas, and therefore cannot be the
          theme of a fine art. Thus in architecture also they are of
          secondary origin, and have a subordinate significance, which I
          shall bring out immediately. If it were the task of architecture as
          a fine art simply to exhibit these, then the model would have the
          same effect as the finished work. But this is distinctly not the
          case; on the contrary, the works of architecture, in order to act
          æsthetically, absolutely must have a considerable size; nay, they
          can never be too large, but may easily be too small. Indeed
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ceteris paribus</span></span> the æsthetic
          effect is in exact proportion to the size of the building, because
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page187">[pg 187]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg187"></a> only great masses
          make the action of gravitation apparent and impressive in a high
          degree. But this confirms my view that the tendency and antagonism
          of those fundamental forces of nature constitute the special
          æsthetical material of architecture, which, according to its
          nature, requires large masses in order to become visible, and
          indeed capable of being felt. The forms in architecture, as was
          shown above in the case of the column, are primarily determined by
          the immediate structural end of each part. But so far as this
          leaves anything undetermined, the law of the most perfect clearness
          to perception, thus also of the easiest comprehensibility, comes
          in; for architecture has its existence primarily in our spatial
          perception, and accordingly appeals to our <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          priori</span></span> faculty for this. But these qualities always
          result from the greatest regularity of the forms and rationality of
          their relations. Therefore beautiful architecture selects only
          regular figures composed of straight lines or regular curves, and
          also the bodies which result from these, such as cubes,
          parallelopipeda, cylinders, spheres, pyramids, and cones; but as
          openings sometimes circles or ellipses, yet, as a rule, quadrates,
          and still oftener rectangles, the latter of thoroughly rational and
          very easily comprehended relation of their sides (not, for instance
          as 6:7, but as 1:2, 2:3), finally also blind windows or niches of
          regular and comprehensible proportions. For the same reason it will
          readily give to the buildings themselves and their large parts a
          rational and easily comprehended relation of height and breadth;
          for example, it will let the height of a facade be half the
          breadth, and place the pillars so that every three or four of them,
          with the intervals between them, will measure a line which is equal
          to the height, thus will form a quadrate. The same principle of
          perceptibility and easy comprehension demands also that a building
          should be easily surveyed. This introduces symmetry, which is
          further necessary to mark out the work as a whole, and to
          distinguish its essential from its <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page188">[pg 188]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg188"></a> accidental limitation; for sometimes, for
          example, it is only under the guidance of symmetry that one knows
          whether one has before one three buildings standing beside each
          other or only one. Thus only by means of symmetry does a work of
          architecture at once announce itself as individual unity, and as
          the development of a central thought.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now although, as
          was cursorily shown above, architecture has by no means to imitate
          the forms of nature, such as the stems of trees or even the human
          figure, yet it ought to work in the spirit of nature, for it makes
          the law its own, <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">natura nihil agit frustra,
          nihilque supervacaneum, et quod commodissimum in omnibus suis
          operationibus sequitur</span></span>, and accordingly avoids
          everything which is even only apparently aimless, and always
          attains the end in view in each case, whether this is purely
          architectonic, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, structural, or an end
          connected with usefulness, by the shortest and most natural path,
          and thus openly exhibits the end through the work itself. Thus it
          attains a certain grace, analogous to that which in living
          creatures consists in the ease and suitableness of every movement
          and position to its end. Accordingly we see in the good antique
          style of architecture every part, whether pillar, column, arch,
          entablature, or door, window, stair, or balcony, attain its end in
          the directest and simplest manner, at the same time displaying it
          openly and naively; just as organised nature also does in its
          works. The tasteless style of architecture, on the contrary, seeks
          in everything useless roundabout ways, and delights in caprices,
          thereby hits upon aimlessly broken and irregular entablatures,
          grouped columns, fragmentary cornices on door arches and gables,
          meaningless volutes, scrolls, and such like. It plays with the
          means of the art without understanding its aims, as children play
          with the tools of grown-up people. This was given above as the
          character of the bungler. Of this kind is every interruption of a
          straight line, every alteration <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page189">[pg 189]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg189"></a> in the sweep of a curve, without apparent
          end. On the other hand, it is also just that naive simplicity in
          the disclosure and attainment of the end, corresponding to the
          spirit in which nature works and fashions, that imparts such beauty
          and grace of form to antique pottery that it ever anew excites our
          wonder, because it contrasts so advantageously in original taste
          with our modern pottery, which bears the stamp of vulgarity,
          whether it is made of porcelain or common potter's clay. At the
          sight of the pottery and implements of the ancients we feel that if
          nature had wished to produce such things it would have done so in
          these forms. Since, then, we see that the beauty of architecture
          arises from the unconcealed exhibition of the ends, and the
          attainment of them by the shortest and most natural path, my theory
          here appears in direct contradiction with that of Kant, which
          places the nature of all beauty in an apparent design without an
          end.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sole theme
          of architecture here set forth—support and burden—is so very
          simple, that just on this account this art, so far as it is a fine
          art (but not so far as it serves useful ends), is perfect and
          complete in essential matters, since the best Greek period, at
          least, is not susceptible of any important enrichment. On the other
          hand, the modern architect cannot noticeably depart from the rules
          and patterns of the ancients without already being on the path of
          deterioration. Therefore there remains nothing for him to do but to
          apply the art transmitted to him by the ancients, and carry out the
          rules so far as is possible under the limitations which are
          inevitably laid down for him by wants, climate, age, and country.
          For in this art, as in sculpture, the effort after the ideal unites
          with the imitation of the ancients.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I scarcely need
          to remind the reader that in all these considerations I have had in
          view antique architecture alone, and not the so-called Gothic
          style, which is of Saracen origin, and was introduced by the Goths
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page190">[pg 190]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg190"></a> in Spain to the rest
          of Europe. Perhaps a certain beauty of its own kind is not
          altogether to be denied to this style, but yet if it attempts to
          oppose itself to the former as its equal, then this is a barbarous
          presumption which must not be allowed for a moment. How
          beneficently, after contemplating such Gothic magnificence, does
          the sight of a building correctly carried out in the antique style
          act upon our mind! We feel at once that this alone is right and
          true. If one could bring an ancient Greek before our most
          celebrated Gothic cathedrals, what would he say to them?—Βαρβαροι!
          Our pleasure in Gothic works certainly depends for the most part
          upon the association of ideas and historical reminiscences, thus
          upon a feeling which is foreign to art. All that I have said of the
          true æsthetic end, of the spirit and the theme of architecture,
          loses in the case of these works its validity. For the freely lying
          entablature has vanished, and with it the columns: support and
          burden, arranged and distributed in order to give visible form to
          the conflict between rigidity and gravity, are here no longer the
          theme. Moreover, that thorough, pure rationality by virtue of which
          everything admits of strict account, nay, already presents it of
          its own accord to the thoughtful beholder, and which belongs to the
          character of antique architecture, can here no longer be found; we
          soon become conscious that here, instead of it, a will guided by
          other conceptions has moved; therefore much remains unexplained to
          us. For only the antique style of architecture is conceived in a
          purely <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">objective</span></em> spirit; the Gothic style
          is more in the subjective spirit. Yet as we have recognised the
          peculiar æsthetic fundamental thought of antique architecture in
          the unfolding of the conflict between rigidity and gravity, if we
          wish to discover in Gothic architecture also an analogous
          fundamental thought, it will be this, that here the entire
          overcoming and conquest of gravity by rigidity is supposed to be
          exhibited. For in accordance with this the horizontal line which is
          that of burden has entirely <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page191">[pg 191]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg191"></a> vanished, and the action of gravity only
          appears indirectly, disguised in arches and vaults, while the
          vertical line which is that of support, alone prevails, and makes
          palpable to the senses the victorious action of rigidity, in
          excessively high buttresses, towers, turrets, and pinnacles without
          number which rise unencumbered on high. While in antique
          architecture the tendency and pressure from above downwards is just
          as well represented and exhibited as that from below upwards, here
          the latter decidedly predominates; whence that analogy often
          observed with the crystal, whose crystallisation also takes place
          with the overcoming of gravity. If now we attribute this spirit and
          fundamental thought to Gothic architecture, and would like thereby
          to set it up as the equally justified antithesis of antique
          architecture, we must remember that the conflict between rigidity
          and gravity, which the antique architecture so openly and naïvely
          expresses, is an actual and true conflict founded in nature; the
          entire overcoming of gravity by rigidity, on the contrary, remains
          a mere appearance, a fiction accredited by illusion. Every one will
          easily be able to see clearly how from the fundamental thought
          given here, and the peculiarities of Gothic architecture noticed
          above, there arises that mysterious and hyperphysical character
          which is attributed to it. It principally arises, as was already
          mentioned, from the fact that here the arbitrary has taken the
          place of the purely rational, which makes itself known as the
          thorough adaptation of the means to the end. The many things that
          are really aimless, but yet are so carefully perfected, raise the
          assumption of unknown, unfathomed, and secret ends, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          give the appearance of mystery. On the other hand, the brilliant
          side of Gothic churches is the interior; because here the effect of
          the groined vaulting borne by slender, crystalline, aspiring
          pillars, raised high aloft, and, all burden having disappeared,
          promising eternal security, impresses the mind; while most of the
          faults which have been mentioned lie <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page192">[pg 192]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg192"></a> upon the outside. In antique buildings the
          external side is the most advantageous, because there we see better
          the support and the burden; in the interior, on the other hand, the
          flat roof always retains something depressing and prosaic. For the
          most part, also, in the temples of the ancients, while the outworks
          were many and great, the interior proper was small. An appearance
          of sublimity is gained from the hemispherical vault of a cupola, as
          in the Pantheon, of which, therefore, the Italians also, building
          in this style, have made a most extensive use. What determines this
          is, that the ancients, as southern peoples, lived more in the open
          air than the northern nations who have produced the Gothic style of
          architecture. Whoever, then, absolutely insists upon Gothic
          architecture being accepted as an essential and authorised style
          may, if he is also fond of analogies, regard it as the negative
          pole of architecture, or, again, as its minor key. In the interest
          of good taste I must wish that great wealth will be devoted to that
          which is objectively, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, actually, good and right,
          to what in itself is beautiful, but not to that whose value depends
          merely upon the association of ideas. Now when I see how this
          unbelieving age so diligently finishes the Gothic churches left
          incomplete by the believing Middle Ages, it looks to me as if it
          were desired to embalm a dead Christianity.</p>

          The Plastic And Pictorial Arts.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In sculpture
          beauty and grace are the principal things; but in painting
          expression, passion, and character predominate; therefore just so
          much of the claims of beauty must be neglected. For a perfect
          beauty of all forms, such as sculpture demands, would detract from
          the characteristic and weary by monotony. Accordingly painting may
          also present ugly faces and emaciated figures; sculpture, on the
          other hand, demands beauty, although not always perfect, but,
          throughout, strength and fulness of the figures. Consequently a
          thin Christ upon the Cross, a dying St. Jerome, wasted by age and
          disease, like the masterpiece of Domenichino, is a proper subject
          for painting; while, on the contrary, the marble figure by
          Donatello, in the gallery at Florence, of John the Baptist, reduced
          to skin and bone by fasting, has, in spite of the masterly
          execution, a repulsive effect. From this point of view sculpture
          seems suitable for the affirmation, painting for the negation, of
          the will to live, and from this it may be explained why sculpture
          was the art of the ancients, while painting has been the art of the
          Christian era.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In connection
          with the exposition given in § 45 of the first volume, that the
          discovery, recognition, and retention of the type of human beauty
          depends to a certain extent upon an anticipation of it, and
          therefore in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page194">[pg
          194]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg194"></a>
          part has an <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span>
          foundation, I find that I have yet to bring out clearly the fact
          that this anticipation nevertheless requires experience, by which
          it may be stirred up; analogous to the instinct of the brutes,
          which, although guiding the action <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          priori</span></span>, yet requires determination by motives in the
          details of it. Experience and reality present to the intellect of
          the artist human forms, which, in one part or another, are more or
          less true to nature, as if it were asking for his judgment
          concerning them, and thus, after the Socratic method, call forth
          from that obscure anticipation the distinct and definite knowledge
          of the ideal. Therefore it assisted the Greek sculptors very much
          that the climate and customs of their country gave them opportunity
          the whole day of seeing half-naked forms, and in the gymnasium
          entirely naked forms. In this way every limb presented its plastic
          significance to criticism, and to comparison with the ideal which
          lay undeveloped in their consciousness. Thus they constantly
          exercised their judgment with regard to all forms and limbs, down
          to their finest shades of difference; and thus, little by little,
          their originally dull anticipation of the ideal of human beauty was
          raised to such distinct consciousness that they became capable of
          objectifying it in works of art. In an entirely analogous manner
          some experience is useful and necessary to the poet for the
          representation of characters. For although he does not work
          according to experience and empirical data, but in accordance with
          the clear consciousness of the nature of humanity, as he finds it
          within himself, yet experience serves this consciousness as a
          pattern, incites it and gives it practice. Accordingly his
          knowledge of human nature and its varieties, although in the main
          it proceeds <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span> and by
          anticipation, yet first receives life, definiteness, and compass
          through experience. But, supporting ourselves upon the preceding
          book and chapter 44 in the following book, we can go still deeper
          into the ground of that marvellous sense of beauty of the Greeks
          which made them <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page195">[pg
          195]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg195"></a>
          alone of all nations upon earth capable of discovering the true
          normal type of the human form, and accordingly of setting up the
          pattern of beauty and grace for the imitation of all ages, and we
          can say: The same thing which, if it remains unseparated from the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em>, gives sexual instinct with
          its discriminating selection, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sexual
          love</span></em> (which it is well known was subject among the
          Greeks to great aberrations), becomes, if, by the presence of an
          abnormally preponderating intellect, it separates itself from the
          will and yet remains active, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the objective sense of beauty</span></em> of
          the human form, which now shows itself primarily as a critical
          artistic sense, but can rise to the discovery and representation of
          the norm of all parts and proportions; as was the case in Phidias,
          Praxiteles, Scopas, &amp;c. Then is fulfilled what Goethe makes the
          artist say—</p>

</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And again,
          analogous to this, that which in the poet, if it remained
          unseparated from the will, would give only worldly prudence,
          becomes, if it frees itself from the will by abnormal preponderance
          of the intellect, the capacity for objective, dramatic
          representation.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Modern
          sculpture, whatever it may achieve, is still analogous to modern
          Latin poetry, and, like this, is a child of imitation, sprung from
          reminiscences. If it presumes to try to be original, it at once
          goes astray, especially upon the bad path of forming according to
          nature as it lies before it, instead of according to the
          proportions of the ancients. Canova, Thorwaldsen, and many others
          may be compared to Johannes Secundus and Owenus. It is the same
          with architecture, only there it is founded in the art itself, the
          purely æsthetic part of which is of small compass, and was already
          exhausted by the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page196">[pg
          196]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg196"></a>
          ancients; therefore the modern architect can only distinguish
          himself in the wise application of it; and he ought to know that he
          removes himself from good taste just so far as he departs from the
          style and pattern of the Greeks.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The art of the
          painter, considered only so far as it aims at producing the
          appearance of reality, may ultimately be referred to the fact that
          he understands how to separate purely what in seeing is the mere
          sensation, thus the affection of the retina, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          the only directly given <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">effect</span></em>, from its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cause</span></em>,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the objective external
          world, the perception of which first rises in the understanding
          from this effect; whereby, if he has technical skill, he is in a
          position to produce the same effect in the eye through an entirely
          different cause, the patches of applied colour, from which then in
          the understanding of the beholder the same perception again arises
          through the unavoidable reference of the effect to the ordinary
          cause.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If we consider
          how there lies something so entirely idiosyncratic, so thoroughly
          original, in every human countenance, and that it presents a whole
          which can only belong to a unity consisting entirely of necessary
          parts by virtue of which we recognise a known individual out of so
          many thousands, even after long years, although the possible
          variations of human features, especially of one race, lie within
          very narrow limits, we must doubt whether anything of such
          essential unity and such great originality could ever proceed from
          any other source than from the mysterious depths of the inner being
          of nature; but from this it would follow that no artist could be
          capable of really reproducing the original peculiarity of a human
          countenance, or even of composing it according to nature from
          recollection. Accordingly what he produced of this kind would
          always be only a half true, nay, perhaps an impossible composition;
          for how should he compose an actual physiognomical unity when the
          principle of this unity is really unknown to him? Therefore,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page197">[pg 197]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg197"></a> in the case of every
          face which has merely been imagined by an artist, we must doubt
          whether it is in fact a possible face, and whether nature, as the
          master of all masters, would not show it to be a bungled production
          by pointing out complete contradictions in it. This would, of
          course, lead to the principle that in historical paintings only
          portraits ought to figure, which certainly would then have to be
          selected with the greatest care and in some degree idealised. It is
          well known that great artists have always gladly painted from
          living models and introduced many portraits.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Although, as is
          explained in the text, the real end of painting, as of art in
          general, is to make the comprehension of the (Platonic) Ideas of
          the nature of the world easier for us, whereby we are at once
          thrown into the state of pure, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          will-less, knowing, there yet belongs to it besides this an
          independent beauty of its own, which is produced by the mere
          harmony of the colours, the pleasingness of the grouping, the happy
          distribution of light and shade, and the tone of the whole picture.
          This accompanying subordinate kind of beauty furthers the condition
          of pure knowing, and is in painting what the diction, the metre,
          and rhyme are in poetry; both are not what is essential, but what
          acts first and immediately.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I have some
          further evidence to give in support of my judgment given in the
          first volume, § 50, on the inadmissibleness of allegory in
          painting. In the Borghese palace at Rome there is the following
          picture by Michael Angelo Caravaggio: Jesus, as a child of about
          ten years old, treads upon the head of a serpent, but entirely
          without fear and with great calmness; and His mother, who
          accompanies Him, remains quite as indifferent. Close by stands St.
          Elizabeth, looking solemnly and tragically up to heaven. Now what
          could be thought of this kyriological hieroglyphic by a man who had
          never heard anything about the seed of the woman that should bruise
          the head of the serpent? At Florence, in the library of the palace
          Riccardi, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page198">[pg
          198]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg198"></a>
          we find the following allegory upon the ceiling, painted by Luca
          Giordano, which is meant to signify that science frees the
          understanding from the bonds of ignorance: the understanding is a
          strong man bound with cords, which are just falling off; a nymph
          holds a mirror in front of him, another hands him a large detached
          wing; above sits science on a globe, and beside her, with a globe
          in her hand, the naked truth. At Ludwigsburg, near Stuttgart, there
          is a picture which shows us time, as Saturn, cutting off with a
          pair of shears the wings of Cupid. If this is meant to signify that
          when we grow old love proves unstable, this no doubt has its
          truth.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The following
          may serve to strengthen my solution of the problem as to why
          Laocoon does not cry out. One may practically convince oneself of
          the faulty effect of the representation of shrieking by the works
          of the plastic and pictorial arts, which are essentially dumb, by a
          picture of the slaughter of the innocents, by Guido Reni, which is
          to be found in the Academy of Arts at Bologna, and in which this
          great artist has committed the mistake of painting six shrieking
          wide-open mouths. Let any one who wants to have this more distinct
          think of a pantomimic representation on the stage, and in one of
          the scenes an urgent occasion for one of the players to shriek; if
          now the dancer who is representing this part should express the
          shriek by standing for a while with his mouth wide open, the loud
          laughter of the whole house would bear witness to the absurdity of
          the thing. Accordingly, since the shrieking of Laocoon had to be
          avoided for reasons which did not lie in the objects to be
          represented, but in the nature of the representing art, the task
          thus arose for the artist so to present this not-shrieking as to
          make it plausible to us that a man in such a position should not
          shriek. He solves this problem by representing the bite of the
          snake, not as having already taken place, nor yet as still
          threatening, but as just happening now in the side; for thereby the
          lower part <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page199">[pg
          199]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg199"></a>
          of the body is contracted, and shrieking made impossible. This
          immediate but only subordinate reason was correctly discovered by
          Goethe, and is expounded at the end of the eleventh book of his
          autobiography, and also in the paper on Laocoon in the first part
          of the Propylæa; but the ultimate, primary reason, which conditions
          this one, is that which I have set forth. I cannot refrain from
          remarking that I here stand in the same relation to Goethe as with
          reference to the theory of colours. In the collection of the Duke
          of Aremberg at Brussels there is an antique head of Laocoon which
          was found later. However, the head in the world-renowned group is
          not a restored one which follows from Goethe's special table of all
          the restorations of this group, which is given at the end of the
          first volume of the Propylæa, and is also confirmed by the fact
          that the head which was found later resembles that of the group
          very much. Thus we must assume that another antique repetition of
          the group has existed to which the Aremberg head belonged. In my
          opinion the latter excels both in beauty and expression that of the
          group. It has the mouth decidedly wider open than in the group, yet
          not really to the extent of shrieking.</p>

<span style="font-size: 144%">On The Æsthetics Of
          Poetry.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I might give it
          as the simplest and most correct definition of poetry, that it is
          the art of bringing the imagination into play by means of words.
          How it brings this to pass I have shown in the first volume, § 51.
          A special confirmation of what is said there is afforded by the
          following passage in a letter of Wieland's to Merck, which has
          since then been published: <span class="tei tei-q">“I have spent
          two days and a half upon a single stanza, in which the whole thing
          ultimately depended upon a single word which I wanted and could not
          find. I revolved and turned about the thing and my brain in all
          directions, because naturally, where a picture was in question, I
          desired to bring the same definite vision, which floated before my
          own mind into the mind of my reader also, and for this all often
          depends, <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ut nosti</span></span>, upon
          a single touch or suggestion or reflex”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Briefe an
          Merck</span></span>, edited by Wagner, 1835, p. 193). From the fact
          that the imagination of the reader is the material in which poetry
          exhibits its pictures, it has the advantage that the fuller
          development of these pictures and their finer touches, take place
          in the imagination of every one just as is most suitable to his
          individuality, his sphere of knowledge, and his humour, and
          therefore move him in the most lively manner; instead of which
          plastic and pictorial art cannot so adapt itself, but here
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> picture, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em>
          form, must satisfy all. And yet this will always bear in some
          respect the stamp of the individuality of the artist or of his
          model, as a subjective <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page201">[pg
          201]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg201"></a>
          or accidental and inefficient addition; although always less so the
          more objective, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the more of a genius, the
          artist is. This, to some extent, explains why works of poetry
          exercise a much stronger, deeper, and more universal effect than
          pictures and statues; the latter, for the most part, leave the
          common people quite cold; and, in general, the plastic arts are
          those which have the weakest effect. A remarkable proof of this is
          afforded by the frequent discovery and disclosure of pictures by
          great masters in private houses and all kinds of localities, where
          they have been hanging for many generations, not buried and
          concealed, but merely unheeded, thus without any effect. In my time
          (1823) there was even discovered in Florence a Madonna of
          Raphael's, which had hung for a long series of years on the wall of
          the servants' hall of a palace (in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Quartiere di S.
          Spirito</span></span>); and this happens among Italians, the nation
          which is gifted beyond all others with the sense of the beautiful.
          It shows how little direct and immediate effect the works of
          plastic and pictorial art have, and that it requires more culture
          and knowledge to prize them than the works of all other arts. How
          unfailingly, on the contrary, a beautiful melody that touches the
          heart makes its journey round the world, and an excellent poem
          wanders from people to people. That the great and rich devote their
          powerful support just to the plastic and pictorial arts, and expend
          considerable sums upon <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">their</span></em> works only; nay, at the
          present day, an idolatry, in the proper sense of the term, gives
          the value of a large estate for a picture of a celebrated old
          master—this depends principally upon the rarity of the
          masterpieces, the possession of which therefore gratifies pride;
          and then also upon the fact that the enjoyment of them demands very
          little time and effort, and is ready at any moment, for a moment;
          while poetry and even music make incomparably harder conditions.
          Corresponding to this, the plastic and pictorial arts may be
          dispensed with; whole nations—for example, the Mohammedan
          peoples—are <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page202">[pg
          202]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg202"></a>
          without them, but no people is without music and poetry.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the
          intention with which the poet sets our imagination in motion is to
          reveal to us the Ideas, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, to show us by an example
          what life and what the world is. The first condition of this is
          that he himself has known it; according as his knowledge has been
          profound or superficial so will his poem be. Therefore, as there
          are innumerable degrees of profoundness and clearness in the
          comprehension of the nature of things, so are there of poets. Each
          of these, however, must regard himself as excellent so far as he
          has correctly represented what he knew, and his picture answers to
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">his</span></em> original: he must make himself
          equal with the best, for even in the best picture he does not
          recognise more than in his own, that is, as much as he sees in
          nature itself; for his glance cannot now penetrate deeper. But the
          best himself recognises himself as such in the fact that he sees
          how superficial was the view of the others, how much lay beyond it
          which they were not able to repeat, because they did not see it,
          and how much further his own glance and picture reaches. If he
          understood the superficial poets as little as they do him, then he
          would necessarily despair; for just because it requires an
          extraordinary man to do him justice, but the inferior poets can
          just as little esteem him as he can them, he also has long to live
          upon his own approval before that of the world follows it.
          Meanwhile he is deprived even of his own approval, for he is
          expected to be very modest. It is, however, as impossible that he
          who has merit, and knows what it costs, should himself be blind to
          it, as that a man who is six feet high should not observe that he
          rises above others. If from the base of the tower to the summit is
          300 feet, then certainly it is just as much from the summit to the
          base. Horace, Lucretius, Ovid, and almost all the ancients have
          spoken proudly of themselves, and also Dante, Shakspeare, Bacon of
          Verulam, and many more. That one can be a great man without
          observing anything of it is an absurdity <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page203">[pg 203]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg203"></a> of which only hopeless incapacity can
          persuade itself, in order that it may regard the feeling of its own
          insignificance as modesty. An Englishman has wittily and correctly
          observed that merit and modesty have nothing in common except the
          initial letter.<a href="#note_22" id="noteref_22" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">22</span></span></a> I have
          always a suspicion about modest celebrities that they may very well
          be right; and Corneille says directly—</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Finally, Goethe
          has frankly said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Only good-for-nothings
          are modest.”</span> But the assertion would be still more certain
          that those who so eagerly demand modesty from others, urge modesty,
          unceasingly cry, <span class="tei tei-q">“Only be modest, for God's
          sake, only be modest!”</span> are positively good-for-nothings,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, persons entirely without
          merit, manufactures of nature, ordinary members of the great mass
          of humanity. For he who himself has merit also concedes
          merit—understands himself truly and really. But he who himself
          lacks all excellence and merit wishes there was no such thing: the
          sight of it in others stretches him upon the rack; pale, green, and
          yellow envy consumes his heart: he would like to annihilate and
          destroy all those who are personally favoured; but if unfortunately
          he must let them live, it must only be under the condition that
          they conceal, entirely deny, nay, abjure their advantages. This,
          then, is the root of the frequent eulogising of modesty. And if the
          deliverers of these eulogies have the opportunity of suppressing
          merit as it arises, or at least of hindering it from showing itself
          or being known, who can doubt that they will do it? For this is the
          practice of their theory.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now, although
          the poet, like every artist, always brings before us only the
          particular, the individual, what he has <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page204">[pg 204]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg204"></a> known, and wishes by his work to make us
          know, is the (Platonic) Idea, the whole species; therefore in his
          images, as it were, the type of human characters and situations
          will be impressed. The narrative and also the dramatic poet takes
          the whole particular from life, and describes it accurately in its
          individuality, but yet reveals in this way the whole of human
          existence; for although he seems to have to do with the particular,
          in truth he is concerned with that which is everywhere and at all
          times. Hence it arises that sentences, especially of the dramatic
          poets, even without being general apophthegms, find frequent
          application in actual life. Poetry is related to philosophy as
          experience is related to empirical science. Experience makes us
          acquainted with the phenomenon in the particular and by means of
          examples, science embraces the whole of phenomena by means of
          general conceptions. So poetry seeks to make us acquainted with the
          (Platonic) Ideas through the particular and by means of examples.
          Philosophy aims at teaching, as a whole and in general, the inner
          nature of things which expresses itself in these. One sees even
          here that poetry bears more the character of youth, philosophy that
          of old age. In fact, the gift of poetry really only flourishes in
          youth; and also the susceptibility for poetry is often passionate
          in youth: the youth delights in verses as such, and is often
          contented with small ware. This inclination gradually diminishes
          with years, and in old age one prefers prose. By that poetical
          tendency of youth the sense of the real is then easily spoiled. For
          poetry differs from reality by the fact that in it life flows past
          us, interesting and yet painless; while in reality, on the
          contrary, so long as it is painless it is uninteresting, and as
          soon as it becomes interesting, it does not remain without pain.
          The youth who has been initiated into poetry earlier than into
          reality now desires from the latter what only the former can
          achieve; this is a principal source of the discomfort which
          oppresses the most gifted youths.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page205">[pg 205]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg205"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Metre and rhyme
          are a fetter, but also a veil which the poet throws round him, and
          under which he is permitted to speak as he otherwise dared not do;
          and that is what gives us pleasure. He is only half responsible for
          all that he says; metre and rhyme must answer for the other half.
          Metre, or measure, as mere rhythm, has its existence only in time,
          which is a pure perception <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          priori</span></span>, thus, to use Kant's language, belongs merely
          to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pure
          sensibility</span></em>; rhyme, on the other hand, is an affair of
          sensation, in the organ of hearing, thus of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">empirical
          sensibility</span></em>. Therefore rhythm is a much nobler and more
          worthy expedient than rhyme, which the ancients accordingly
          despised, and which found its origin in those imperfect languages
          which arose from the corruption of earlier ones and in barbarous
          times. The poorness of French poetry depends principally upon the
          fact that it is confined to rhyme alone without metre, and it is
          increased by the fact that in order to conceal its want of means it
          has increased the difficulty of rhyming by a number of pedantic
          laws, such as, for example, that only syllables which are written
          the same way rhyme, as if it were for the eye and not for the ear
          that the hiatus is forbidden; that a number of words must not
          occur; and many such, to all of which the new school of French
          poetry seeks to put an end. In no language, however, at least on
          me, does the rhyme make such a pleasing and powerful impression as
          in Latin; the rhymed Latin poems of the Middle Ages have a peculiar
          charm. This must be explained from the fact that the Latin language
          is incomparably more perfect, more beautiful and noble, than any
          modern language, and now moves so gracefully in the ornaments and
          spangles which really belong to the latter, and which it itself
          originally despised.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To serious
          consideration it might almost appear as high treason against our
          reason that even the slightest violence should be done to a thought
          or its correct and pure expression, with the childish intention
          that after some <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page206">[pg
          206]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg206"></a>
          syllables the same sound of word should be heard, or even that
          these syllables themselves should present a kind of rhythmical
          beat. But without such violence very few verses would be made; for
          it must be attributed to this that in foreign languages verses are
          much more difficult to understand than prose. If we could see into
          the secret workshops of the poets, we would find that the thought
          is sought for the rhyme ten times oftener than the rhyme for the
          thought; and even when the latter is the case, it is not easily
          accomplished without pliability on the part of the thought. But the
          art of verse bids defiance to these considerations, and, moreover,
          has all ages and peoples upon its side, so great is the power which
          metre and rhyme exercise upon the feeling, and so effective the
          mysterious <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">lenocinium</span></span> which belongs to
          them. I would explain this from the fact that a happily rhymed
          verse, by its indescribably emphatic effect, raises the feeling as
          if the thought expressed in it lay already predestined, nay,
          performed in the language, and the poet has only had to find it
          out. Even trivial thoughts receive from rhythm and rhyme a touch of
          importance; cut a figure in this attire, as among girls plain faces
          attract the eye by finery. Nay, even distorted and false thoughts
          gain through versification an appearance of truth. On the other
          hand, even famous passages from famous poets shrink together and
          become insignificant when they are reproduced accurately in prose.
          If only the true is beautiful, and the dearest ornament of truth is
          nakedness, then a thought which appears true and beautiful in prose
          will have more true worth than one which affects us in the same way
          in verse. Now it is very striking, and well worth investigating,
          that such trifling, nay, apparently childish, means as metre and
          rhyme produce so powerful an effect. I explain it to myself in the
          following manner: That which is given directly to the sense of
          hearing, thus the mere sound of the words, receives from rhythm and
          rhyme a certain completeness and significance in itself
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page207">[pg 207]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg207"></a> for it thereby
          becomes a kind of music; therefore it seems now to exist for its
          own sake, and no longer as a mere means, mere signs of something
          signified, the sense of the words. To please the ear with its sound
          seems to be its whole end, and therefore with this everything seems
          to be attained and all claims satisfied. But that it further
          contains a meaning, expresses a thought, presents itself now as an
          unexpected addition, like words to music—as an unexpected present
          which agreeably surprises us—and therefore, since we made no
          demands of this kind, very easily satisfies us; and if indeed this
          thought is such that, in itself, thus said in prose, it would also
          be significant, then we are enchanted. I can remember, in my early
          childhood, that I had delighted myself for a long time with the
          agreeable sound of verse before I made the discovery that it all
          also contained meaning and thoughts. Accordingly there is also, in
          all languages, a mere doggerel poetry almost entirely devoid of
          meaning. Davis, the Sinologist, in the preface to his translation
          of the <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Laou-sang-urh</span></span>,”</span> or
          <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">An Heir in Old Age</span></span>”</span>
          (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">London,
          1817</span></span>), observes that the Chinese dramas partly
          consist of verses which are sung, and adds: <span class="tei tei-q">“The meaning of them is often obscure, and, according
          to the statements of the Chinese themselves, the end of these
          verses is especially to flatter the ear, and the sense is
          neglected, and even entirely sacrificed to the harmony.”</span> Who
          is not reminded here of the choruses of many Greek tragedies which
          are often so hard to make out?</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sign by
          which one most immediately recognises the genuine poet, both of the
          higher and lower species, is the unforced nature of his rhymes.
          They have appeared of themselves as if by divine arrangement; his
          thoughts come to him already in rhyme. The homely, prosaic man on
          the contrary, seeks the rhyme for the thought; the bungler seeks
          the thought for the rhyme. Very often one can find out from a
          couple of rhymed verses which of the two had the thought and which
          had the rhyme as its <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page208">[pg
          208]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg208"></a>
          father. The art consists in concealing the latter, so that such
          lines may not appear almost as mere stuffed out <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">boutsrimés</span></span>.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">According to my
          feeling (proofs cannot here be given) rhyme is from its nature
          binary: its effect is limited to one single recurrence of the same
          sound, and is not strengthened by more frequent repetition. Thus
          whenever a final syllable has received the one of the same sound
          its effect is exhausted; the third recurrence of the note acts
          merely as a second rhyme which accidentally hits upon the same
          sound, but without heightening the effect; it links itself on to
          the existing rhyme, yet without combining with it to produce a
          stronger impression. For the first note does not sound through the
          second on to the third: therefore this is an æsthetic pleonasm, a
          double courage which is of no use. Least of all, therefore, do such
          accumulations of rhymes merit the heavy sacrifices which they cost
          in the octave rhyme, the terza rima, and the sonnet, and which are
          the cause of the mental torture under which we sometimes read such
          productions, for poetical pleasure is impossible under the
          condition of racking our brains. That the great poetical mind
          sometimes overcomes even these forms, and moves in them with ease
          and grace, does not extend to a recommendation of the forms
          themselves, for in themselves they are as ineffectual as they are
          difficult. And even in good poets, when they make use of these
          forms, we frequently see the conflict between the rhyme and the
          thought, in which now one and now the other gains the victory; thus
          either the thought is stunted for the sake of the rhyme, or the
          rhyme has to be satisfied with a weak <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">à
          peu près</span></span>. Since this is so, I do not regard it as an
          evidence of ignorance, but as a proof of good taste, that
          Shakspeare in his sonnets has given different rhymes to each
          quatraine. At any rate, their acoustic effect is not in the least
          diminished by it, and the thought obtains its rights far more than
          it could have done if it had had to be laced up in the customary
          Spanish boots.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page209">[pg
          209]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg209"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is a
          disadvantage for the poetry of a language if it has many words
          which cannot be used in prose, and, on the other hand, dare not use
          certain words of prose. The former is mostly the case in Latin and
          Italian poetry, and the latter in French, where it has recently
          been very aptly called, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">La bégeulerie de la langue
          française</span></span>;”</span> both are to be found less in
          English, and least in German. For such words belonging exclusively
          to poetry remain foreign to our heart, do not speak to us directly,
          and therefore leave us cold. They are a conventional language of
          poetry, and as it were mere painted sensations instead of real
          ones: they exclude genuine feeling.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The distinction,
          so often discussed in our own day, between <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">classic</span></em>
          and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">romantic</span></em> poetry seems to me
          ultimately to depend upon the fact that the former knows no other
          motives than those which are purely human, actual, and natural; the
          latter, on the other hand, also treats artificial conventional, and
          imaginary motives as efficient. To such belong the motives which
          spring from the Christian mythus, also from the chivalrous
          over-strained fantastical law of honour, further from the absurd
          and ludicrous Germano-Christian veneration of women, and lastly
          from doting and mooning hyperphysical amorousness. But even in the
          best poets of the romantic class, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span>,
          in Calderon, we can see to what ridiculous distortions of human
          relations and human nature these motives lead. Not to speak of the
          Autos, I merely refer to such pieces as <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">No siempre el peor es
          cierto</span></span>”</span> (The worst is not always certain), and
          <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">El postrero duelo en
          España</span></span>”</span> (The last duel in Spain), and similar
          comedies <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">en capa y espada</span></span>: with the
          elements mentioned there is here further associated the scholastic
          subtility so often appearing in the conversation which at that time
          belonged to the mental culture of the higher classes. How decidedly
          advantageous, on the contrary, is the position of the poetry of the
          ancients, which always remains true to nature; and the result is
          that classical poetry has an unconditional, romantic poetry only a
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page210">[pg 210]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg210"></a> conditional, truth
          and correctness; analogous to Greek and Gothic architecture. Yet,
          on the other hand, we must remark here that all dramatic or
          narrative poems which transfer their scene to ancient Greece or
          Rome lose by this from the fact that our knowledge of antiquity,
          especially in what concerns the details of life, is insufficient,
          fragmentary, and not drawn from perception. This obliges the poet
          to avoid much and to content himself with generalities, whereby he
          becomes abstract, and his work loses that concreteness and
          individualisation which is throughout essential to poetry. It is
          this which gives all such works the peculiar appearance of
          emptiness and tediousness. Only Shakspeare's works of this kind are
          free from it; because without hesitation he has presented, under
          the names of Greeks and Romans, Englishmen of his own time.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It has been
          objected to many masterpieces of lyrical poetry, especially some
          Odes of Horace (see, for example, the second of the third book) and
          several of Goethe's songs (for example, <span class="tei tei-q">“The Shepherd's Lament”</span>), that they lack proper
          connection and are full of gaps in the thought. But here the
          logical connection is intentionally neglected, in order that the
          unity of the fundamental sensation and mood may take its place,
          which comes out more clearly just by the fact that it passes like a
          thread through the separate pearls, and brings about the quick
          changes of the objects of contemplation, in the same way as in
          music the transition from one key to another is brought about by
          the chord of the seventh, through which the still sounding
          fundamental note becomes the dominant of the new key. Most
          distinctly, even exaggeratedly, the quality here described is found
          in the Canzone of Petrarch which begins, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Mai non vo' più cantar, com' io
          soleva</span></span>.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Accordingly, as
          in the lyrical poem the subjective element predominates, so in the
          drama, on the contrary, the objective element is alone and
          exclusively present. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page211">[pg
          211]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg211"></a>
          Between the two epic poetry in all its forms and modifications,
          from the narrative romance to the epos proper, has a broad middle
          path. For although in the main it is objective, yet it contains a
          subjective element, appearing now more and now less, which finds
          its expression in the tone, in the form of the delivery, and also
          in scattered reflections. We do not so entirely lose sight of the
          poet as in the drama.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The end of the
          drama in general is to show us in an example what is the nature and
          existence of man. The sad or the bright side of these can be turned
          to us in it, or their transitions into each other. But the
          expression, <span class="tei tei-q">“nature and existence of
          man,”</span> already contains the germ of the controversy whether
          the nature, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the character, or the
          existence, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the fate, the adventures,
          the action, is the principal thing. Moreover, the two have grown so
          firmly together that although they can certainly be separated in
          conception, they cannot be separated in the representation of them.
          For only the circumstances, the fate, the events, make the
          character manifest its nature, and only from the character does the
          action arise from which the events proceed. Certainly, in the
          representation, the one or the other may be made more prominent;
          and in this respect the piece which centres in the characters and
          the piece which centres in the plot are the two extremes.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The common end
          of the drama and the epic, to exhibit, in significant characters
          placed in significant situations, the extraordinary actions brought
          about by both, will be most completely attained by the poet if he
          first introduces the characters to us in a state of peace, in which
          merely their general colour becomes visible, and allows a motive to
          enter which produces an action, out of which a new and stronger
          motive arises, which again calls forth a more significant action,
          which, in its turn, begets new and even stronger motives, whereby,
          then, in the time suitable to the form of the poem, the most
          passionate <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page212">[pg
          212]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg212"></a>
          excitement takes the place of the original peace, and in this now
          the important actions occur in which the qualities of the
          characters which have hitherto slumbered are brought clearly to
          light, together with the course of the world.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Great poets
          transform themselves into each of the persons to be represented,
          and speak out of each of them like ventriloquists; now out of the
          hero, and immediately afterwards out of the young and innocent
          maiden, with equal truth and naturalness: so Shakspeare and Goethe.
          Poets of the second rank transform the principal person to be
          represented into themselves. This is what Byron does; and then the
          other persons often remain lifeless, as is the case even with the
          principal persons in the works of mediocre poets.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Our pleasure in
          tragedy belongs, not to the sense of the beautiful, but to that of
          the sublime; nay, it is the highest grade of this feeling. For, as
          at the sight of the sublime in nature we turn away from the
          interests of the will, in order to be purely perceptive, so in the
          tragic catastrophe we turn away even from the will to live. In
          tragedy the terrible side of life is presented to us, the wail of
          humanity, the reign of chance and error, the fall of the just, the
          triumph of the wicked; thus the aspect of the world which directly
          strives against our will is brought before our eyes. At this sight
          we feel ourselves challenged to turn away our will from life, no
          longer to will it or love it. But just in this way we become
          conscious that then there still remains something over to us, which
          we absolutely cannot know positively, but only negatively, as that
          which does not will life. As the chord of the seventh demands the
          fundamental chord; as the colour red demands green, and even
          produces it in the eye; so every tragedy demands an entirely
          different kind of existence, another world, the knowledge of which
          can only be given us indirectly just as here by such a demand. In
          the moment of the tragic catastrophe the conviction becomes
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page213">[pg 213]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg213"></a> more distinct to us
          than ever that life is a bad dream from which we have to awake. So
          far the effect of the tragedy is analogous to that of the dynamical
          sublime, for like this it lifts us above the will and its
          interests, and puts us in such a mood that we find pleasure in the
          sight of what tends directly against it. What gives to all tragedy,
          in whatever form it may appear, the peculiar tendency towards the
          sublime is the awakening of the knowledge that the world, life, can
          afford us no true pleasure, and consequently is not worthy of our
          attachment. In this consists the tragic spirit: it therefore leads
          to resignation.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I admit that in
          ancient tragedy this spirit of resignation seldom appears and is
          expressed directly. Œdipus Colonus certainly dies resigned and
          willing; yet he is comforted by the revenge on his country.
          Iphigenia at Aulis is very willing to die; yet it is the thought of
          the welfare of Greece that comforts her, and occasions the change
          of her mind, on account of which she willingly accepts the death
          which at first she sought to avoid by any means. Cassandra, in the
          Agamemnon of the great Æschylus, dies willingly, αρκειτω βιος
          (1306); but she also is comforted by the thought of revenge.
          Hercules, in the Trachiniæ, submits to necessity, and dies
          composed, but not resigned. So also the Hippolytus of Euripides, in
          whose case it surprises us that Artemis, who appears to comfort
          him, promises him temples and fame, but never points him to an
          existence beyond life, and leaves him in death, as all gods forsake
          the dying:—in Christianity they come to him; and so also in
          Brahmanism and Buddhism, although in the latter the gods are really
          exotic. Thus Hippolytus, like almost all the tragic heroes of the
          ancients, shows submission to inevitable fate and the inflexible
          will of the gods, but no surrender of the will to live itself. As
          the Stoic equanimity is fundamentally distinguished from Christian
          resignation by the fact that it teaches only patient endurance and
          composed expectation <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page214">[pg
          214]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg214"></a>
          of unalterably necessary evil, while Christianity teaches
          renunciation, surrender of the will; so also the tragic heroes of
          the ancients show resolute subjection under the unavoidable blows
          of fate, while Christian tragedy, on the contrary, shows the
          surrender of the whole will to live, joyful forsaking of the world
          in the consciousness of its worthlessness and vanity. But I am also
          entirely of opinion that modern tragedy stands higher than that of
          the ancients. Shakspeare is much greater than Sophocles; in
          comparison with Goethe's Iphigenia one might find that of Euripides
          almost crude and vulgar. The Bacchæ of Euripides is a revolting
          composition in favour of the heathen priests. Many ancient pieces
          have no tragic tendency at all, like the Alcestis and Iphigenia in
          Tauris of Euripides; some have disagreeable, or even disgusting
          motives, like the Antigone and Philocteles. Almost all show the
          human race under the fearful rule of chance and error, but not the
          resignation which is occasioned by it, and delivers from it. All
          because the ancients had not yet attained to the summit and goal of
          tragedy, or indeed of the view of life itself.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Although, then,
          the ancients displayed little of the spirit of resignation, the
          turning away of the will from life, in their tragic heroes
          themselves, as their frame of mind, yet the peculiar tendency and
          effect of tragedy remains the awakening of that spirit in the
          beholder, the calling up of that frame of mind, even though only
          temporarily. The horrors upon the stage hold up to him the
          bitterness and worthlessness of life, thus the vanity of all its
          struggle. The effect of this impression must be that he becomes
          conscious, if only in obscure feeling, that it is better to tear
          his heart free from life, to turn his will from it, to love not the
          world nor life; whereby then in his deepest soul, the consciousness
          is aroused that for another kind of willing there must also be
          another existence. For if this were not so, then the tendency of
          tragedy would not be this rising above all the ends and
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page215">[pg 215]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg215"></a> good things of life,
          this turning away from it and its seductions, and the turning
          towards another kind of existence, which already lies in this,
          although an existence which is for us quite inconceivable. How
          would it, then, in general, be possible that the exhibition of the
          most terrible side of life, brought before our eyes in the most
          glaring light, could act upon us beneficently, and afford us a
          lofty satisfaction? Fear and sympathy, in the excitement of which
          Aristotle places the ultimate end of tragedy, certainly do not in
          themselves belong to the agreeable sensations: therefore they
          cannot be the end, but only the means. Thus the summons to turn
          away the will from life remains the true tendency of tragedy, the
          ultimate end of the intentional exhibition of the suffering of
          humanity, and is so accordingly even where this resigned exaltation
          of the mind is not shown in the hero himself, but is merely excited
          in the spectator by the sight of great, unmerited, nay, even
          merited suffering. Many of the moderns also are, like the ancients,
          satisfied with throwing the spectator into the mood which has been
          described, by the objective representation of human misfortune as a
          whole; while others exhibit this through the change of the frame of
          mind of the hero himself, effected by suffering. The former give,
          as it were, only the premisses, and leave the conclusion to the
          spectator; while the latter give the conclusion, or the moral of
          the fable, also, as the change of the frame of mind of the hero,
          and even also as reflection, in the mouth of the chorus, as, for
          example, Schiller in <span class="tei tei-q">“The Bride of
          Messina:”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Life is not the highest
          good.”</span> Let me remark here that the genuine tragic effect of
          the catastrophe, thus the resignation and exaltation of the mind of
          the hero which is brought about by it, seldom appears so purely
          motived and so distinctly expressed as in the opera of <span class="tei tei-q">“Norma,”</span> where it comes in in the duet,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Qual cor tradisti, qual cor
          perdesti</span></span>,”</span> in which the change of the will is
          distinctly indicated by the quietness which is suddenly introduced
          into the music. In general, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page216">[pg 216]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg216"></a> this piece—regarded apart altogether from its
          excellent music, and also from the diction which can only be that
          of a libretto, and considered only according to its motives and its
          inner economy—is a highly perfect tragedy, a true pattern of tragic
          disposition of the motives, tragic progress of the action, and
          tragic development, together with the effect of these upon the
          frame of mind of the hero, raising it above the world, and which is
          then also communicated to the spectator; indeed the effect attained
          here is the less delusive and the more indicative of the true
          nature of tragedy that no Christians, nor even Christian ideas,
          appear in it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The neglect of
          the unity of time and place with which the moderns are so often
          reproached is only a fault when it goes so far that it destroys the
          unity of the action; for then there only remains the unity of the
          principal character, as, for example, in Shakspeare's <span class="tei tei-q">“Henry VIII.”</span> But even the unity of the action
          does not need to go so far that the same thing is spoken of
          throughout, as in the French tragedies which in general observe
          this so strictly that the course of the drama is like a geometrical
          line without breadth. There it is constantly a case of <span class="tei tei-q">“Only get on! <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">Pensez à votre
          affaire!</span></span>”</span> and the thing is expedited and
          hurried on in a thoroughly business fashion, and no one detains
          himself with irrelevances which do not belong to it, or looks to
          the right or the left. The Shakspearian tragedy, on the other hand,
          is like a line which has also breadth: it takes time, <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">exspatiatur</span></span>: speeches and even
          whole scenes occur which do not advance the action, indeed do not
          properly concern it, by which, however, we get to know the
          characters or their circumstances more fully, and then understand
          the action also more thoroughly. This certainly remains the
          principal thing, yet not so exclusively that we forget that in the
          last instance what is aimed at is the representation of human
          nature and existence generally.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The dramatic or
          epic poet ought to know that he is <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page217">[pg 217]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg217"></a> fate, and should therefore be inexorable, as
          it is; also that he is the mirror of the human race, and should
          therefore represent very many bad and sometimes profligate
          characters, and also many fools, buffoons, and eccentric persons;
          then also, now and again, a reasonable, a prudent, an honest, or a
          good man, and only as the rarest exception a truly magnanimous man.
          In the whole of Homer there is in my opinion no really magnanimous
          character presented, although many good and honest. In the whole of
          Shakspeare there may be perhaps a couple of noble, though by no
          means transcendently noble, characters to be found; perhaps
          Cordelia, Coriolanus—hardly more; on the other hand, his works
          swarm with the species indicated above. But Iffland's and
          Kotzebue's pieces have many magnanimous characters; while Goldoni
          has done as I recommended above, whereby he shows that he stands
          higher. On the other hand, Schiller's <span class="tei tei-q">“Minna von Barnhelm”</span> labours under too much and
          too universal magnanimity; but so much magnanimity as the one
          Marquis Posa displays is not to be found in the whole of Goethe's
          works together. There is, however, a small German piece called
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Duty for Duty's Sake”</span> (a title
          which sounds as if it had been taken from the Critique of Practical
          Reason), which has only three characters, and yet all the three are
          of most transcendent magnanimity.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Greeks have
          taken for their heroes only royal persons; and so also for the most
          part have the moderns. Certainly not because the rank gives more
          worth to him who is acting or suffering; and since the whole thing
          is just to set human passions in play, the relative value of the
          objects by which this happens is indifferent, and peasant huts
          achieve as much as kingdoms. Moreover, civic tragedy is by no means
          to be unconditionally rejected. Persons of great power and
          consideration are yet the best adapted for tragedy on this account,
          that the misfortune in which we ought to recognise the fate of
          humanity must have a sufficient magnitude to appear terrible to the
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page218">[pg 218]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg218"></a> spectator, whoever
          he may be. Euripides himself says, <span class="tei tei-q">“φευ,
          φευ, τα μεγαλα, μεγαλα και πασχει κακα”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Stob.
          Flor.</span></span>, vol. ii. p. 299). Now the circumstances which
          plunge a citizen family into want and despair are in the eyes of
          the great or rich, for the most part, very insignificant, and
          capable of being removed by human assistance, nay, sometimes even
          by a trifle: such spectators, therefore, cannot be tragically
          affected by them. On the other hand, the misfortunes of the great
          and powerful are unconditionally terrible, and also accessible to
          no help from without; for kings must help themselves by their own
          power, or fall. To this we have to add that the fall is greatest
          from a height. Accordingly persons of the rank of citizens lack
          height to fall from.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If now we have
          found the tendency and ultimate intention of tragedy to be a
          turning to resignation, to the denial of the will to live, we shall
          easily recognise in its opposite, comedy, the incitement to the
          continued assertion of the will. It is true the comedy, like every
          representation of human life, without exception, must bring before
          our eyes suffering and adversity; but it presents it to us as
          passing, resolving itself into joy, in general mingled with
          success, victory, and hopes, which in the end preponderate;
          moreover, it brings out the inexhaustible material for laughter of
          which life, and even its adversities themselves are filled, and
          which under all circumstances ought to keep us in a good humour.
          Thus it declares, in the result, that life as a whole is thoroughly
          good, and especially is always amusing. Certainly it must hasten to
          drop the curtain at the moment of joy, so that we may not see what
          comes after; while the tragedy, as a rule, so ends that nothing can
          come after. And moreover, if once we contemplate this burlesque
          side of life somewhat seriously, as it shows itself in the naïve
          utterances and gestures which trifling embarrassment, personal
          fear, momentary anger, secret envy, and many similar emotions force
          upon the forms of the real life that mirrors <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page219">[pg 219]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg219"></a> itself here, forms which deviate
          considerably from the type of beauty, then from this side also,
          thus in an unexpected manner, the reflective spectator may become
          convinced that the existence and action of such beings cannot
          itself be an end; that, on the contrary, they can only have
          attained to existence by an error, and that what so exhibits itself
          is something which had better not be.</p>

<span style="font-size: 144%">On History.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the passage
          of the first volume referred to below I have fully shown that more
          is achieved for our knowledge of mankind by poetry than by history,
          and why this is so; inasmuch as more real instruction was to be
          expected from the former than from the latter. Aristotle has also
          confessed this, for he says: <span class="tei tei-q">“και
          φιλοσοφωτερον και σπουδαιοτερον ποιησις ἱστοριας εστιν”</span>
          (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">et res magis philosophica, et melior poësis
          est quam historia</span></span><a href="#note_24" id="noteref_24" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">24</span></span></a>),
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De
          poët.</span></span>, c. 9. Yet, in order to cause no
          misunderstanding as to the value of history, I wish here to express
          my thoughts about it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In every class
          and species of things the facts are innumerable, the individuals
          infinite in number, the variety of their differences
          unapproachable. At the first glance at them the curious mind
          becomes giddy; however much it investigates, it sees itself
          condemned to ignorance. But then comes science: it separates the
          innumerable multitude, arranges it under generic conceptions, these
          again under conceptions of species, whereby it opens the path to a
          knowledge of the general and the particular, which also comprehends
          the innumerable individuals, for it holds good of all without one
          being obliged to consider each particular for itself. Thus it
          promises satisfaction to the investigating mind. Then all
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page221">[pg 221]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg221"></a> sciences place
          themselves together, and above the real world of individual things,
          as that which they have divided among them. Over them all, however,
          moves philosophy, as the most general, and therefore important,
          rational knowledge, which promises the conclusions for which the
          others have only prepared the way. History alone cannot properly
          enter into that series, since it cannot boast of the same advantage
          as the others, for it lacks the fundamental characteristic of
          science, the subordination of what is known, instead of which it
          can only present its co-ordination. Therefore there is no system of
          history, as there is of every other science. It is therefore
          certainly rational knowledge, but it is not a science. For it never
          knows the particular by means of the general, but must comprehend
          the particular directly, and so, as it were, creeps along the
          ground of experience; while the true sciences move above it,
          because they have obtained comprehensive conceptions by means of
          which they command the particular, and, at least within certain
          limits, anticipate the possibility of things within their sphere,
          so that they can be at ease even about what may yet have to come.
          The sciences, since they are systems of conceptions, speak always
          of species; history speaks of individuals. It would accordingly be
          a science of individuals, which is a contradiction. It also follows
          that the sciences all speak of that which always is as history, on
          the other hand, of that which is once, and then no more. Since,
          further, history has to do with the absolutely particular and
          individuals, which from its nature is inexhaustible, it knows
          everything only imperfectly and half. Besides, it must also let
          itself be taught by every new day in its trivial commonplaceness
          what as yet it did not know at all. If it should be objected that
          in history also there is subordination of the particular under the
          general, because the periods, the governments, and other general
          changes, or political revolutions, in short, all that is given in
          historical tables, is the general, to which the special
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page222">[pg 222]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg222"></a> subordinates itself,
          this would rest upon a false comprehension of the conception of the
          general. For the general in history here referred to is merely
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">subjective</span></em>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          its generality springs merely from the inadequacy of the individual
          knowledge of the things, but not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">objective</span></em>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, a
          conception in which the things would actually already be thought
          together. Even the most general in history is in itself only a
          particular and individual, a long period of time, or an important
          event; therefore the special is related to this as the part to the
          whole, but not as the case to the rule; which, on the contrary,
          takes place in all the sciences proper because they afford
          conceptions and not mere facts. On this account in these sciences
          by a correct knowledge of the general we can determine with
          certainty the particular that arises. If, for example, I know the
          laws of the triangle in general, I can then also tell what must be
          the properties of the triangle laid before me; and what holds good
          of all mammals, for example, that they have double ventricles of
          the heart, exactly seven cervical vertebræ, lungs, diaphragm,
          bladder, five senses, &amp;c., I can also assert of the strange bat
          which has just been caught, before dissecting it. But not so in
          history, where the general is no objective general of the
          conception, but merely a subjective general of my knowledge, which
          can only be called general inasmuch as it is superficial. Therefore
          I may always know in general of the Thirty Years' War that it was a
          religious war, waged in the seventeenth century; but this general
          knowledge does not make me capable of telling anything more
          definite about its course. The same opposition is also confirmed by
          the fact that in the real sciences the special and individual is
          that which is most certain, because it rests upon immediate
          apprehension; the general truths, again, are only abstracted from
          it; therefore something false may be more easily assumed in the
          latter. But in history, conversely, the most general is the most
          certain; for example, the periods, the succession of the kings, the
          revolutions, wars, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page223">[pg
          223]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg223"></a>
          treaties of peace; the particulars, again, of the events and their
          connection is uncertain, and becomes always more so the further one
          goes into details. Therefore history is the more interesting the
          more special it is, but the less to be trusted, and approaches then
          in every respect to the romance. For the rest, what importance is
          to be attached to the boasted pragmatic teaching of history he will
          best be able to judge who remembers that sometimes it was only
          after twenty years that he understood the events of his own life in
          their true connection, although the data for this were fully before
          him, so difficult is the combination of the action of the motives
          under the constant interferences of chance and the concealment of
          the intentions. Since now history really always has for its object
          only the particular, the individual fact, and regards this as the
          exclusively real, it is the direct opposite and counterpart of
          philosophy, which considers things from the most general point of
          view, and has intentionally the general as its object, which
          remains identical in every particular; therefore in the particular
          philosophy sees only the general, and recognises the change in its
          manifestation as unessential: φιλοκαθολου γαρ ὁ φιλοσοφος
          (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">generalium amator philosophus</span></span>).
          While history teaches us that at every time something else has
          been, philosophy tries to assist us to the insight that at all
          times exactly the same was, is, and shall be. In truth, the essence
          of human life, as of nature in general, is given complete in every
          present time, and therefore only requires depth of comprehension in
          order to be exhaustively known. But history hopes to make up for
          depth by length and breadth; for it every present time is only a
          fragment which must be supplemented by the past, the length of
          which is, however, infinite, and to which again an infinite future
          is joined. Upon this rests the opposition between philosophical and
          historical minds; the former want to go to the bottom, the latter
          want to go through the whole series. History shows on every side
          only the same under different forms; but whoever does <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page224">[pg 224]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg224"></a> not come to know this in one or a few
          will hardly attain to a knowledge of it by going through all the
          forms. The chapters of the history of nations are at bottom only
          distinguished by the names and dates; the really essential content
          is everywhere the same.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now since the
          material of art is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Idea</span></em>, and the material of science
          the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">concept</span></em>, we see both occupied with
          that which always exists and constantly in the same manner, not
          something which now is and now is not, now is thus and now
          otherwise; therefore both have to do with that which Plato set up
          as the exclusive object of real rational knowledge. The material of
          history, on the other hand, is the particular in its particularity
          and contingency, which at one time is, and then for ever is no
          more, the transient complexities of a human world moved like clouds
          in the wind, a world which is often entirely transformed by the
          most trifling accident. From this point of view the material of
          history appears to us as scarcely a worthy object of the serious
          and painful consideration of the human mind, the human mind which,
          just because it is so transitory, ought to choose for its
          consideration that which passes not away.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Finally, as
          regards the endeavour—specially introduced by the Hegelian
          pseudo-philosophy, everywhere so pernicious and stupefying to the
          mind—to comprehend the history of the world as a planned whole, or,
          as they call it, <span class="tei tei-q">“to construe it
          organically,”</span> a crude and positive realism lies at its
          foundation, which takes the phenomenon for the inner being of the
          world, and imagines that this phenomenon, its forms and events, are
          the chief concern; in which it is secretly supported by certain
          mythological notions which it tacitly assumes: otherwise one might
          ask for what spectators such a comedy was really produced. For,
          since only the individual, and not the human race, has actual,
          immediate unity of consciousness, the unity of the course of life
          of the race is a mere fiction. Besides, as in nature only the
          species are real, and the genera are mere abstractions,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page225">[pg 225]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg225"></a> so in the human race
          only the individuals and their course of life are real, the peoples
          and their lives mere abstractions. Finally, constructive histories,
          guided by a positive optimism, always ultimately end in a
          comfortable, rich, fat State, with a well-regulated constitution,
          good justice and police, useful arts and industries, and, at the
          most, in intellectual perfection; for this, in fact, is alone
          possible, since what is moral remains essentially unaltered. But it
          is the moral element which, according to the testimony of our
          inmost consciousness, is the whole concern: and this lies only in
          the individual as the tendency of his will. In truth, only the life
          of each individual has unity, connection, and true significance: it
          is to be regarded as an instruction, and the meaning of it is
          moral. Only the incidents of our <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">inner</span></em>
          life, since they concern the will, have true reality, and are
          actual events; because the will alone is the thing in itself. In
          every microcosm lies the whole macrocosm, and the latter contains
          nothing more than the former. Multiplicity is phenomenal, and
          external events are mere configurations of the phenomenal world,
          and have therefore directly neither reality nor significance, but
          only indirectly through their relation to the wills of the
          individuals. The endeavour to explain and interpret them directly
          is accordingly like the endeavour to see in the forms of the clouds
          groups of men and animals. What history narrates is in fact only
          the long, heavy, and confused dream of humanity.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Hegelians,
          who regard the philosophy of history as indeed the chief end of all
          philosophy, are to be referred to Plato, who unweariedly repeats
          that the object of philosophy is that which is unchangeable and
          always remains, not that which now is thus and now otherwise. All
          those who set up such constructions of the course of the world, or,
          as they call it, of history, have failed to grasp the principal
          truth of all philosophy, that what is is at all times the same, all
          becoming and arising are only seeming; the Ideas alone are
          permanent; time ideal. This <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page226">[pg 226]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg226"></a> is what Plato holds, this is what Kant holds.
          One ought therefore to seek to understand what exists, what really
          is, to-day and always, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, to know the Ideas (in
          Plato's sense). Fools, on the contrary, imagine that something must
          first become and happen. Therefore they concede to history the
          chief place in their philosophy, and construct it according to a
          preconceived plan of the world, according to which everything is
          ordered for the best, which is then supposed <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">finaliter</span></span> to appear, and will be
          a glorious thing. Accordingly they take the world as perfectly
          real, and place the end of it in the poor earthly happiness, which,
          however much it may be fostered by men and favoured by fate, is a
          hollow, deceptive, decaying, and sad thing, out of which neither
          constitutions and legal systems nor steam-engines and telegraphs
          can ever make anything that is essentially better. The said
          philosophers and glorifiers of history are accordingly simple
          realists, and also optimists and eudæmonists, consequently dull
          fellows and incarnate philistines; and besides are really bad
          Christians, for the true spirit and kernel of Christianity, as also
          of Brahmanism and Buddhism, is the knowledge of the vanity of
          earthly happiness, the complete contempt for it, and the turning
          away from it to an existence of another, nay, an opposite, kind.
          This, I say, is the spirit and end of Christianity, the true
          <span class="tei tei-q">“humour of the matter;”</span> and not, as
          they imagine, monotheism; therefore even atheistic Buddhism is far
          more closely related to Christianity than optimistic Judaism or its
          variety Islamism.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A true
          philosophy of history ought not therefore to consider, as all these
          do, what (to use Plato's language) always <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">becomes</span></em>
          and never <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></em>, and hold this to be the true
          nature of things; but it ought to fix its attention upon that which
          always is and never becomes nor passes away. Thus it does not
          consist in raising the temporal ends of men to eternal and absolute
          ends, and then with art and imagination constructing their progress
          through all complications; but in the insight that not only in its
          development, but in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page227">[pg
          227]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg227"></a>
          its very nature, history is mendacious; for, speaking of mere
          individuals and particular events, it pretends always to relate
          something different, while from beginning to end it repeats always
          the same thing under different names and in a different dress. The
          true philosophy of history consists in the insight that in all
          these endless changes and their confusion we have always before us
          only the same, even, unchanging nature, which to-day acts in the
          same way as yesterday and always; thus it ought to recognise the
          identical in all events, of ancient as of modern times, of the east
          as of the west; and, in spite of all difference of the special
          circumstances, of the costume and the customs, to see everywhere
          the same humanity. This identical element which is permanent
          through all change consists in the fundamental qualities of the
          human heart and head—many bad, few good. The motto of history in
          general should run: <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Eadem, sed
          aliter</span></span>. If one has read Herodotus, then in a
          philosophical regard one has already studied history enough. For
          everything is already there that makes up the subsequent history of
          the world: the efforts, action, sufferings, and fate of the human
          race as it proceeds from the qualities we have referred to, and the
          physical earthly lot.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If in what has
          been said we have recognised that history, regarded as a means for
          the knowledge of the nature of man, is inferior to poetry; then,
          that it is not in the proper sense a science; finally, that the
          endeavour to construct it as a whole with beginning, middle, and
          end, together with a significant connection, is vain, and based
          upon misunderstanding: it would look as if we wished to deny it all
          value if we did not show in what its value consists. Really,
          however, there remains for it, after this conquest by art and
          rejection by science, a quite special province, different from
          both, in which it exists most honourably.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">What reason is to
          the individual that is history to the human race.</span></em> By
          virtue of reason, man is not, like the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page228">[pg 228]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg228"></a> brute, limited to the narrow, perceptible
          present, but also knows the incomparably more extended past, with
          which it is linked, and out of which it has proceeded; and only
          thus has he a proper understanding of the present itself, and can
          even draw inferences as to the future. The brute, on the other
          hand, whose knowledge, devoid of reflection, is on this account
          limited to the present, even when it is tamed, moves about among
          men ignorant, dull, stupid, helpless, and dependent. Analogous to
          this is the nation that does not know its own history, is limited
          to the present of the now living generation, and therefore does not
          understand itself and its own present, because it cannot connect it
          with a past, and explain it from this; still less can it anticipate
          the future. Only through history does a nation become completely
          conscious of itself. Accordingly history is to be regarded as the
          rational consciousness of the human race, and is to the race what
          the reflected and connected consciousness is to the individual who
          is conditioned by reason, a consciousness through the want of which
          the brute is confined to the narrow, perceptible present. Therefore
          every gap in history is like a gap in the recollective
          self-consciousness of a man; and in the presence of a monument of
          ancient times which has outlived the knowledge of itself, as, for
          example, the Pyramids, or temples and palaces in Yucatan, we stand
          as senseless and stupid as the brute in the presence of the action
          of man, in which it is implicated in his service; or as a man
          before something written in an old cipher of his own, the key to
          which he has forgotten; nay, like a somnambulist who finds before
          him in the morning what he has done in his sleep. In this sense,
          then, history is to be regarded as the reason, or the reflected
          consciousness, of the human race, and takes the place of an
          immediate self-consciousness common to the whole race, so that only
          by virtue of it does the human race come to be a whole, come to be
          a humanity. This is the true value of history, and accordingly the
          universal and predominating interest <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page229">[pg 229]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg229"></a> in it depends principally upon the fact that
          it is a personal concern of the human race. Now, what language is
          for the reason of individuals, as an indispensable condition of its
          use, writing is for the reason of the whole race here pointed out;
          for only with this does its real existence begin, as that of the
          individual reason begins first with language. Writing serves to
          restore unity to the consciousness of the human race, which is
          constantly interrupted by death, and therefore fragmentary; so that
          the thought which has arisen in the ancestor is thought out by his
          remote descendant; it finds a remedy for the breaking up of the
          human race and its consciousness into an innumerable number of
          ephemeral individuals, and so bids defiance to the ever hurrying
          time, in whose hand goes forgetfulness. As an attempt to accomplish
          this we must regard not only written, but also <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">stone</span></em>
          monuments, which in part are older than the former. For who will
          believe that those who, at incalculable cost, set in action the
          human powers of many thousands for many years in order to construct
          the pyramids, monoliths, rock tombs, obelisks, temples, and palaces
          which have already existed for thousands of years, could have had
          in view the short span of their own life, too short to let them see
          the finishing of the construction, or even the ostensible end which
          the ignorance of the many required them to allege? Clearly their
          real end was to speak to their latest descendants, to put
          themselves in connection with these, and so to establish the unity
          of the consciousness of humanity. The buildings of the Hindus, the
          Egyptians, even the Greeks and Romans, were calculated to last
          several thousand years, because through higher culture their
          horizon was a wider one; while the buildings of the Middle Ages and
          of modern times have only been intended, at the most, to last a few
          centuries; which, however, is also due to the fact that men trusted
          more to writing after its use had become general, and still more
          since from its womb was born the art of printing. Yet even in the
          buildings of more recent <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page230">[pg
          230]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg230"></a>
          times we see the desire to speak to posterity; and, therefore, it
          is shameful if they are destroyed or disfigured in order to serve
          low utilitarian ends. Written monuments have less to fear from the
          elements, but more to fear from barbarians, than stone ones; they
          accomplish far more. The Egyptians wished to combine the two, for
          they covered their stone monuments with hieroglyphics, nay, they
          added paintings in case the hieroglyphics should no longer be
          understood.</p>

<span style="font-size: 144%">On The Metaphysics Of
          Music.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The outcome, or
          result, of my exposition of the peculiar significance of this
          wonderful art, which is given in the passage of the first volume
          referred to below, and which will here be present to the mind of
          the reader, was, that there is indeed no resemblance between its
          productions and the world as idea, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          the world of nature, but yet there must be a distinct <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">parallelism</span></em>, which was then also
          proved. I have yet to add some fuller particulars with regard to
          this parallelism, which are worthy of attention.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The four voices,
          or parts, of all harmony, the bass, the tenor, the alto, and the
          soprana, or the fundamental note, the third, the fifth, and the
          octave, correspond to the four grades in the series of existences,
          the mineral kingdom, the vegetable kingdom, the brute kingdom, and
          man. This receives an additional and striking confirmation in the
          fundamental rule of music, that the bass must be at a much greater
          distance below the three upper parts than they have between
          themselves; so that it must never approach nearer to them than at
          the most within an octave of them, and generally remains still
          further below them. Hence, then, the correct triad has its place in
          the third octave from the fundamental note. Accordingly the effect
          of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">extended</span></em> harmony, in which the
          bass is widely separated from the other parts, is much more
          powerful and beautiful than that of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">close</span></em>
          harmony, in which it is moved up nearer to them, and which is only
          introduced on account of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page232">[pg 232]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg232"></a> limited compass of the instruments. This
          whole rule, however, is by no means arbitrary, but has its root in
          the natural source of the tonal system; for the nearest consonant
          intervals that sound along with the fundamental note by means of
          its vibrations are the octave and its fifth. Now, in this rule we
          recognise the analogue of the fundamental characteristic of nature
          on account of which organised beings are much more nearly related
          to each other than to the inanimate, unorganised mass of the
          mineral kingdom, between which and them exists the most definite
          boundary and the widest gulf in the whole of nature. The fact that
          the high voice which sings the melody is yet also an integral part
          of the harmony, and therein accords even with the deepest
          fundamental bass, may be regarded as the analogue of the fact that
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the
          same</span></em> matter which in a human organism is the supporter
          of the Idea of man must yet also exhibit and support the Ideas of
          gravitation and chemical qualities, that is, of the lowest grades
          of the objectification of will.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That music acts
          directly upon the will, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the feelings, passions,
          and emotions of the hearer, so that it quickly raises them or
          changes them, may be explained from the fact that, unlike all the
          other arts, it does not express the Ideas, or grades of the
          objectification of the will, but directly the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will
          itself</span></em>.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As surely as
          music, far from being a mere accessory of poetry, is an independent
          art, nay, the most powerful of all the arts, and therefore attains
          its ends entirely with means of its own, so surely does it not
          stand in need of the words of the song or the action of an opera.
          Music as such knows the tones or notes alone, but not the causes
          which produce these. Accordingly, for it even the human voice is
          originally and essentially nothing else than a modified tone, just
          like that of an instrument; and, like every other tone, it has the
          special advantages and disadvantages which are a consequence of the
          instrument that produces it. Now, in this case, that this same
          instrument, as the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page233">[pg
          233]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg233"></a>
          organ of speech, also serves to communicate conceptions is an
          accidental circumstance, which music can certainly also make use
          of, in order to enter into a connection with poetry; but it must
          never make this the principal matter, and concern itself entirely
          with the expression of what for the most part, nay (as Diderot
          gives us to understand in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Le Neveu de Rameau</span></span>), essentially
          are insipid verses. The words are and remain for the music a
          foreign addition, of subordinate value, for the effect of the tones
          is incomparably more powerful, more infallible, and quicker than
          that of the words. Therefore, if words become incorporated in
          music, they must yet assume an entirely subordinate position, and
          adapt themselves completely to it. But the relation appears
          reversed in the case of the given poetry, thus the song or the
          libretto of an opera to which music is adapted. For the art of
          music at once shows in these its power and higher fitness,
          disclosing the most profound ultimate and secret significance of
          the feeling expressed in the words or the action presented in the
          opera, giving utterance to their peculiar and true nature, and
          teaching us the inmost soul of the actions and events whose mere
          clothing and body is set before us on the stage. With regard to
          this superiority of the music, and also because it stands to the
          libretto and the action in the relation of the universal to the
          particular, of the rule to the example, it might perhaps appear
          more fitting that the libretto should be written for the music than
          that the music should be composed for the libretto. However, in the
          customary method, the words and actions of the libretto lead the
          composer to the affections of the will which lie at their
          foundation, and call up in him the feelings to be expressed; they
          act, therefore, as a means of exciting his musical imagination.
          Moreover, that the addition of poetry to music is so welcome to us,
          and a song with intelligible words gives us such deep satisfaction,
          depends upon the fact that in this way our most direct and most
          indirect ways of knowing are called into play at once and
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page234">[pg 234]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg234"></a> in connection. The
          most direct is that for which music expresses the emotions of the
          will itself, and the most indirect that of conceptions denoted by
          words. When the language of the feelings is in question the reason
          does not willingly sit entirely idle. Music is certainly able with
          the means at its own disposal to express every movement of the
          will, every feeling; but by the addition of words we receive
          besides this the objects of these feelings, the motives which
          occasion them. The music of an opera, as it is presented in the
          score, has a completely independent, separate, and, as it were,
          abstract existence for itself, to which the incidents and persons
          of the piece are foreign, and which follows its own unchanging
          rules; therefore it can produce its full effect without the
          libretto. But this music, since it was composed with reference to
          the drama, is, as it were, the soul of the latter; for, in its
          connection with the incidents, persons, and words, it becomes the
          expression of the inner significance of all those incidents, and of
          their ultimate and secret necessity which depends upon this
          significance. The pleasure of the spectator, unless he is a mere
          gaper, really depends upon an indistinct feeling of this. Yet in
          the opera music also shows its heterogeneous nature and higher
          reality by its entire indifference to the whole material of the
          incidents; in consequence of which it everywhere expresses the
          storm of the passions and the pathos of the feelings in the same
          way, and its tones accompany the piece with the same pomp, whether
          Agamemnon and Achilles or the dissensions of a bourgeois family
          form its material. For only the passions, the movements of the
          will, exist for it, and, like God, it sees only the hearts. It
          never assimilates itself to the natural; and therefore, even when
          it accompanies the most ludicrous and extravagant farces of the
          comic opera, it still preserves its essential beauty, purity, and
          sublimity; and its fusion with these incidents is unable to draw it
          down from its height, to which all absurdity is really foreign.
          Thus the profound and serious <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page235">[pg 235]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg235"></a> significance of our existence hangs over the
          farce and the endless miseries of human life, and never leaves it
          for a moment.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If we now cast a
          glance at purely instrumental music, a symphony of Beethoven
          presents to us the greatest confusion, which yet has the most
          perfect order at its foundation, the most vehement conflict, which
          is transformed the next moment into the most beautiful concord. It
          is <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">rerum concordia
          discors</span></span>, a true and perfect picture of the nature of
          the world which rolls on in the boundless maze of innumerable
          forms, and through constant destruction supports itself. But in
          this symphony all human passions and emotions also find utterance;
          joy, sorrow, love, hatred, terror, hope, &amp;c., in innumerable
          degrees, yet all, as it were, only <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">in
          abstracto</span></span>, and without any particularisation; it is
          their mere form without the substance, like a spirit world without
          matter. Certainly we have a tendency to realise them while we
          listen, to clothe them in imagination with flesh and bones, and to
          see in them scenes of life and nature on every hand. Yet, taken
          generally, this is not required for their comprehension or
          enjoyment, but rather imparts to them a foreign and arbitrary
          addition: therefore it is better to apprehend them in their
          immediacy and purity.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Since now, in
          the foregoing remarks, and also in the text, I have considered
          music only from the metaphysical side, that is, with reference to
          the inner significance of its performances, it is right that I
          should now also subject to a general consideration the means by
          which, acting upon our mind, it brings these about; therefore that
          I should show the connection of that metaphysical side of music,
          and the physical side, which has been fully investigated, and is
          well known, I start from the theory which is generally known, and
          has by no means been shaken by recent objections, that all harmony
          of the notes depends upon the coincidence of their vibrations,
          which when two notes sound together occurs perhaps at every second,
          or <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page236">[pg 236]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg236"></a> at every third, or
          at every fourth vibration, according to which, then, they are the
          octave, the fifth, or the fourth of each other, and so on. So long
          as the vibrations of two notes have a rational relation to each
          other, which can be expressed in small numbers, they can be
          connected together in our apprehension through their constantly
          recurring coincidence: the notes become blended, and are thereby in
          consonance. If, on the other hand, that relation is an irrational
          one, or one which can only be expressed in larger numbers, then no
          coincidence of the vibrations which can be apprehended occurs, but
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">obstrepunt sibi perpetuo</span></span>,
          whereby they resist being joined together in our apprehension, and
          accordingly are called a dissonance. Now, according to this theory,
          music is a means of making rational and irrational relations of
          numbers comprehensible, not like arithmetic by the help of the
          concept, but by bringing them to a knowledge which is perfectly
          directly and simultaneously sensible. Now the connection of the
          metaphysical significance of music with this its physical and
          arithmetical basis depends upon the fact that what resists our
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">apprehension</span></em>, the irrational
          relation, or the dissonance, becomes the natural type of what
          resists our <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em>; and, conversely, the
          consonance, or the rational relation, which easily adapts itself to
          our apprehension, becomes the type of the satisfaction of the will.
          And further, since that rational and irrational element in the
          numerical relations of the vibrations admits of innumerable
          degrees, shades of difference, sequences, and variations, by means
          of it music becomes the material in which all the movements of the
          human heart, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, of the will, movements
          whose essential nature is always satisfaction and dissatisfaction,
          although in innumerable degrees, can be faithfully portrayed and
          rendered in all their finest shades and modifications, which takes
          place by means of the invention of the melody. Thus we see here the
          movements of the will transferred to the province of the mere idea,
          which is the exclusive scene of the achievements of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page237">[pg 237]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg237"></a> the fine arts, for they absolutely
          demand that the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will itself</span></em> shall not interfere,
          and that we shall conduct ourselves as pure <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">knowing</span></em>
          subjects. Therefore the affections of the will itself, thus actual
          pain and actual pleasure, must not be excited, but only their
          substitutes, that which is agreeable to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the
          intellect</span></em>, as a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">picture</span></em> of the satisfaction of the
          will, and that which is more or less repugnant to it, as a
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">picture</span></em> of greater or less pain.
          Only thus does music never cause us actual sorrow, but even in its
          most melancholy strains is still pleasing, and we gladly hear in
          its language the secret history of our will, and all its emotions
          and strivings, with their manifold protractions, hindrances, and
          griefs, even in the saddest melodies. When, on the other hand, in
          reality and its terrors, it is our <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will
          itself</span></em> that is roused and tormented, we have not then
          to do with tones and their numerical relations, but are rather now
          ourselves the trembling string that is stretched and twanged.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But, further,
          because, in consequence of the physical theory which lies at its
          foundation, the musical quality of the notes is in the proportion
          of the rapidity of their vibrations, but not in their relative
          strength, the musical ear always follows by preference, in harmony,
          the highest note, not the loudest. Therefore, even in the case of
          the most powerful orchestral accompaniment, the soprano comes out
          clearly, and thus receives a natural right to deliver the melody.
          And this is also supported by its great flexibility, which depends
          upon the same rapidity of the vibrations, and shows itself in the
          ornate passages, whereby the soprano becomes the suitable
          representative of the heightened sensibility, susceptible to the
          slightest impression, and determinable by it, consequently of the
          most highly developed consciousness standing on the uppermost stage
          of the scale of being. Its opposite, from converse causes, is the
          bass, inflexible, rising and falling only in great intervals,
          thirds, fourths, and fifths, and also at every step guided by rigid
          rules. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page238">[pg
          238]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg238"></a>
          It is therefore the natural representative of the inorganic kingdom
          of nature, which is insensible, insusceptible to fine impressions,
          and only determinable according to general laws. It must indeed
          never rise by one tone, for example, from a fourth to a fifth, for
          this produces in the upper parts the incorrect consecutive fifths
          and octaves; therefore, originally and in its own nature, it can
          never present the melody. If, however, the melody is assigned to
          it, this happens by means of counterpoint, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          it is an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">inverted</span></em> bass—one of the upper
          parts is lowered and disguised as a bass; properly speaking, it
          then requires a second fundamental bass as its accompaniment. This
          unnaturalness of a melody lying in the bass is the reason why bass
          airs, with full accompaniment, never afford us pure, undisturbed
          pleasure, like the soprano air, which, in the connection of
          harmony, is alone natural. We may remark in passing that such a
          melodious bass, forcibly obtained by inversion, might, in keeping
          with our metaphysic of music, be compared to a block of marble to
          which the human form has been imparted: and therefore it is
          wonderfully suitable to the stone guest in <span class="tei tei-q">“Don Juan.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But now we shall
          try to get somewhat nearer the foundation of the genesis of melody,
          which can be accomplished by analysing it into its constituent
          parts, and in any case will afford us the pleasure which arises
          from bringing to abstract and distinct consciousness what every one
          knows in the concrete, so that it gains the appearance of
          novelty.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Melody consists
          of two elements, the one rhythmical, the other harmonious. The
          former may also be described as the quantitative, the latter as the
          qualitative element, since the first is concerned with the
          duration, and the second with the pitch of the notes. In the
          writing of music the former depends upon the perpendicular, and the
          latter upon the horizontal lines. Purely arithmetical relations,
          thus relations of time, lie at the foundation of both; in the one
          case the relative duration of the notes, in the other <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page239">[pg 239]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg239"></a> the relative rapidity of their
          vibrations. The rhythmical element is the essential; for it can
          produce a kind of melody of itself alone, and without the other,
          as, for example, on the drum; yet complete melody requires both
          elements. It consists in an alternating <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">disunion and
          reconciliation</span></em> of them, as I shall show immediately;
          but first, since I have already spoken of the harmonious element in
          what has been said, I wish to consider the rhythmical element
          somewhat more closely.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Rhythm</span></em>
          is in time what <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">symmetry</span></em> is in space, division
          into equal parts corresponding to each other. First, into larger
          parts, which again fall into smaller parts, subordinate to the
          former. In the series of the arts given by me <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">architecture</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">music</span></em>
          are the two extreme ends. Moreover, according to their inner
          nature, their power, the extent of their spheres, and their
          significance, they are the most heterogeneous, indeed true
          antipodes. This opposition extends even to the form of their
          appearance, for architecture is in space alone, without any
          connection with time; and music is in time alone, without any
          connection with space.<a href="#note_26" id="noteref_26" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">26</span></span></a> Now
          hence springs their one point of analogy, that as in architecture
          that which orders and holds together is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">symmetry</span></em>, in music it is
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">rhythm</span></em>, and thus here also it
          holds true that extremes meet. As the ultimate constituent parts of
          a building are the exactly similar stones, so the ultimate
          constituent parts of a musical composition are the exactly similar
          beats; yet by being weak or strong, or in general by the measure,
          which denotes the species of time, these are divided into equal
          parts, which may be compared to the dimensions of the stone. The
          musical period consists of several bars, and it has also two equal
          parts, one rising, aspiring, generally going to the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page240">[pg 240]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg240"></a> dominant, and one sinking, quieting,
          returning to the fundamental note. Two or several periods
          constitute a part, which in general is also symmetrically doubled
          by the sign of repetition; two parts make a small piece of music,
          or only a movement of a larger piece; and thus a concerto or sonata
          usually consists of three movements, a symphony of four, and a mass
          of five. Thus we see the musical composition bound together and
          rounded off as a whole, by symmetrical distribution and repeated
          division, down to the beats and their fractions, with thorough
          subordination, superordination, and co-ordination of its members,
          just as a building is connected and rounded off by its symmetry.
          Only in the latter that is exclusively in space which in the former
          is exclusively in time. The mere feeling of this analogy has in the
          last thirty years called forth the oft-repeated, daring witticism,
          that architecture is frozen music. The origin of this can be traced
          to Goethe; for, according to Eckermann's <span class="tei tei-q">“Conversations,”</span> vol. ii. p. 88, he said:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I have found among my papers a page on
          which I call architecture a rigidified music; and really there is
          something in it; the mood which is produced by architecture
          approaches the effect of music.”</span> Probably he let fall this
          witticism much earlier in conversation, and in that case it is well
          known that there were never wanting persons to pick up what he so
          let fall that they might afterwards go about decked with it. For
          the rest, whatever Goethe may have said, the analogy of music and
          architecture, which is here referred by me to its sole ground, the
          analogy of rhythm with symmetry, extends accordingly only to the
          outward form, and by no means to the inner nature of the two arts,
          which is entirely different. Indeed it would be absurd to wish to
          put on the same level in essential respects the most limited and
          the weakest of all the arts, and the most far-reaching and
          powerful. As an amplification of the analogy pointed out, we might
          add further, that when music, as it were in a fit of desire for
          independence, seizes the opportunity of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page241">[pg 241]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg241"></a> a pause to free itself from the control of
          rhythm, to launch out into the free imagination of an ornate
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cadenza</span></em>, such a piece of music
          divested of all rhythm is analogous to the ruin which is divested
          of symmetry, and which accordingly may be called, in the bold
          language of the witticism, a frozen <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cadenza</span></em>.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After this
          exposition of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">rhythm</span></em>, I have now to show how the
          nature of melody consists in the constantly renewed <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">disunion and
          reconciliation</span></em> of the rhythmical, and the harmonious
          elements of it. Its harmonious element has as its assumption the
          fundamental note, as the rhythmical element has the species of
          time, and consists in a wandering from it through all the notes of
          the scale, until by shorter or longer digressions it reaches a
          harmonious interval, generally the dominant or sub-dominant, which
          affords it an incomplete satisfaction; and then follows, by a
          similarly long path, its return to the fundamental note, with which
          complete satisfaction appears. But both must so take place that the
          attainment of the interval referred to and the return to the
          fundamental note correspond with certain favourite points of the
          rhythm, otherwise it will not work. Thus, as the harmonious
          succession of sounds requires certain notes, first of all the
          tonic, next to it the dominant, and so on, so rhythm, on its part,
          requires certain <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">points of time</span></em>, certain numbered
          bars, and certain parts of these bars, which are called strong or
          good beats, or the accented parts of the bar, in opposition to the
          weak or bad beats, or unaccented parts of the bar. Now the disunion
          of these two fundamental elements consists in this, that because
          the demand of one is satisfied that of the other is not; and their
          reconciliation consists in this, that both are satisfied at once
          and together. That wandering of the notes until they find a more or
          less harmonious interval must so take place that this interval is
          attained only after a definite number of bars, and also at an
          accented part of the bar, and in this way becomes for it a kind of
          resting-point; and similarly <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page242">[pg 242]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg242"></a> the return to the keynote must take place
          after a like number of bars, and also at an accented part of the
          bar, and thus complete satisfaction is then attained. So long as
          this required coincidence of the satisfaction of both elements is
          not attained, the rhythm, on the one hand, may follow its regular
          course, and, on the other hand, the required notes may occur often
          enough, but yet they will remain entirely without that effect
          through which melody arises. The following very simple example may
          serve to illustrate this:—</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em; text-align: center"></p>
<div class="tei tei-figure" style="text-align: center; width: 70%">
<a href="images/music.png" id="id-4337655252469976176"><img alt="Illustration: Music" src="images/music.png" id="img_images_music.png"></a>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here the
          harmonious sequence of notes finds the keynote just at the end of
          the first bar; but it does not receive any satisfaction from this,
          because the rhythm is caught at the least accented part of the bar.
          Immediately afterwards, in the second bar, the rhythm has the
          accented part of the bar, but the sequence of notes has arrived at
          the seventh. Thus here the two elements of melody are entirely
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">disunited</span></em>; and we feel disquieted.
          In the second half of the period everything is reversed, and in the
          last note they are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">reconciled</span></em>. This kind of thing can
          be shown in every melody, although generally in a much more
          extended form. Now the constant disunion and reconciliation of its
          two elements which there takes place is, when metaphysically
          considered, the copy of the origination of new wishes, and then of
          their satisfaction. Thus, by flattery, music penetrates into our
          hearts, for it presents the image of the complete satisfaction of
          its wishes. More closely considered, we see in this procedure of
          melody a condition which, to a certain extent, is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">inward</span></em>
          (the harmonious) meet with an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">outward</span></em> condition (the
          rhythmical), as if by an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">accident</span></em>,—which is certainly
          brought about by the composer, and which may, so far, be compared
          to rhyme in poetry. But this is just the copy of the meeting of our
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page243">[pg 243]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg243"></a> wishes with the
          favourable outward circumstances which are independent of them, and
          is thus the picture of happiness. The effect of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">suspension</span></em> also deserves to be
          considered here. It is a dissonance which delays the final
          consonance, which is awaited with certainty; and thus the longing
          for it is strengthened, and its appearance satisfies all the more.
          Clearly an analogue of the heightened satisfaction of the will
          through delay. The complete cadence requires the preceding chord of
          the seventh on the dominant; because the most deeply felt
          satisfaction and the most entire relief can only follow the most
          earnest longing. Thus, in general, music consists of a constant
          succession of more or less disquieting chords, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          chords which excite longing, and more or less quieting and
          satisfying chords; just as the life of the heart (the will) is a
          constant succession of greater or less disquietude through desire
          and aversion, and just as various degrees of relief. Accordingly
          the harmonious sequence of chords consists of the correct
          alternation of dissonance and consonance. A succession of merely
          consonant chords would be satiating, wearisome, and empty, like the
          languor produced by the satisfaction of all wishes. Therefore
          dissonances must be introduced, although they disquiet us and
          affect us almost painfully, but only in order to be resolved again
          in consonances with proper preparation. Indeed, in the whole of
          music there are really only two fundamental chords, the dissonant
          chord of the seventh and the consonant triad, to which all chords
          that occur can be referred. This just corresponds to the fact, that
          for the will there are at bottom only dissatisfaction and
          satisfaction, under however many forms they may present themselves.
          And as there are two general fundamental moods of the mind,
          serenity, or at least healthiness, and sadness, or even oppression,
          so music has two general keys, the major and the minor, which
          correspond to these, and it must always be in one of the two. But
          it is, in fact, very wonderful that there is a sign of pain which
          is <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page244">[pg 244]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg244"></a> neither physically
          painful nor yet conventional, but which nevertheless is suitable
          and unmistakable: the minor. From this we may measure how deeply
          music is founded in the nature of things and of man. With northern
          nations, whose life is subject to hard conditions, especially with
          the Russians, the minor prevails, even in the church music. Allegro
          in the minor is very common in French music, and is characteristic
          of it; it is as if one danced while one's shoe pinched.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I add further a
          few subsidiary remarks. When the key-note is changed, and with it
          the value of all the intervals, in consequence of which the same
          note figures as the second, the third, the fourth, and so on, the
          notes of the scale are analogous to actors, who must assume now one
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">rôle</span></em>, now another, while their
          person remains the same. That the actors are often not precisely
          suited to these <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">rôles</span></em> may be compared to the
          unavoidable impurity of every harmonic system (referred to at the
          end of § 52 of the first volume) which the equal temperament has
          introduced.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Perhaps some may
          be offended, that, according to this metaphysic of it, music, which
          so often exalts our minds, which seems to us to speak of other and
          better worlds than ours, yet really only flatters the will to live,
          because it exhibits to it its nature, deludes it with the image of
          its success, and at the end expresses its satisfaction and
          contentment. The following passage from the <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vedas</span></span>”</span> may serve to quiet
          such doubts: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Etanand sroup, quod forma gaudii

<span style="font-size: 144%">Chapter XL. Preface.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The supplements
          to this fourth book would be very considerable if it were not that
          two of its principal subjects which stand specially in need of
          being supplemented—the freedom of the will and the foundation of
          ethics—have, on the occasion of prize questions being set by two
          Scandinavian Academies, been fully worked out by me in the form of
          a monograph, which was laid before the public in the year 1841
          under the title, <span class="tei tei-q">“The Two Fundamental
          Problems of Ethics.”</span> Accordingly I assume an acquaintance on
          the part of my readers with the work which has just been mentioned,
          just as unconditionally as in the supplements to the second book I
          have assumed it with regard to the work <span class="tei tei-q">“On
          the Will in Nature.”</span> In general I make the demand that
          whoever wishes to make himself acquainted with my philosophy shall
          read every line of me. For I am no voluminous writer, no fabricator
          of compendiums, no earner of pecuniary rewards, not one whose
          writings aim at the approbation of a minister; in a word, not one
          whose pen is under the influence of personal ends. I strive after
          nothing but the truth, and write as the ancients wrote, with the
          sole intention of preserving my thoughts, so that they may be for
          the benefit of those who understand how to meditate upon them and
          prize <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page248">[pg 248]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg248"></a> them. Therefore I
          have written little, but that little with reflection and at long
          intervals, and accordingly I have also confined within the smallest
          possible limits those repetitions which in philosophical works are
          sometimes unavoidable on account of the connection, and from which
          no single philosopher is free; so that by far the most of what I
          have to say is only to be found in one place. On this account,
          then, whoever wishes to learn from me and understand me must leave
          nothing unread that I have written. Yet one can judge me and
          criticise me without this, as experience has shown; and to this
          also I further wish much pleasure.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Meanwhile the
          space gained by the said elimination of two important subjects will
          be very welcome to us. For since those explanations, which every
          man has more at heart than anything else, and which therefore in
          every system, as ultimate results, form the apex of its pyramid,
          are also crowded together in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">my</span></em> last book, a larger space will
          gladly be granted to every firmer proof or more accurate account of
          these. Besides this we have been able to discuss here, as belonging
          to the doctrine of the <span class="tei tei-q">“assertion of the
          will to live,”</span> a question which in our fourth book itself
          remained untouched, as it was also entirely neglected by all
          philosophers before me: it is the inner significance and real
          nature of the sexual love, which sometimes rises to a vehement
          passion—a subject which it would not have been paradoxical to take
          up in the ethical part of philosophy if its importance had been
          known.</p>

<span style="font-size: 144%">On Death And Its Relation To The
          Indestructibility Of Our True Nature.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Death is the
          true inspiring genius, or the muse of philosophy, wherefore
          Socrates has defined the latter as θανατου μελετη. Indeed without
          death men would scarcely philosophise. Therefore it will be quite
          in order that a special consideration of this should have its place
          here at the beginning of the last, most serious, and most important
          of our books.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The brute lives
          without a proper knowledge of death; therefore the individual brute
          enjoys directly the absolute imperishableness of the species, for
          it is only conscious of itself as endless. In the case of men the
          terrifying certainty of death necessarily entered with reason. But
          as everywhere in nature with every evil a means of cure, or at
          least some compensation, is given, the same reflection which
          introduces the knowledge of death also assists us to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">metaphysical</span></em> points of view, which
          comfort us concerning it, and of which the brute has no need and is
          incapable. All religious and philosophical systems are principally
          directed to this end, and are thus primarily the antidote to the
          certainty of death, which the reflective reason produces out of its
          own means. Yet the degree in which they attain this end is very
          different, and certainly <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> religion or philosophy will,
          far more than the others, enable men to look death in the face with
          a quiet glance. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page250">[pg
          250]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg250"></a>
          Brahmanism and Buddhism, which teach man to regard himself as
          himself, the original being, the Brahm, to which all coming into
          being and passing away is essentially foreign, will achieve much
          more in this respect than such as teach that man is made out of
          nothing, and actually begins at birth his existence derived from
          another. Answering to this we find in India a confidence and a
          contempt for death of which one has no conception in Europe. It is,
          in fact, a hazardous thing to force upon a man, by early imprinting
          them, weak and untenable conceptions in this important regard, and
          thereby making him for ever incapable of taking up correct and
          stable ones. For example, to teach him that he recently came out of
          nothing, and consequently through an eternity has been nothing, but
          yet for the future will be imperishable, is just the same as to
          teach him that although he is through and through the work of
          another, yet he will be held responsible through all eternity for
          his actions. If, then, when the mind ripens and reflection appears,
          the untenable nature of such doctrines forces itself upon him, he
          has nothing better to put in its place, nay, is no longer capable
          of understanding anything better, and thus loses the comfort which
          nature had destined for him also, as a compensation for the
          certainty of death. In consequence of such a process, we see even
          now in England (1844), among ruined factory hands, the Socialists,
          and in Germany, among ruined students, the young Hegelians, sink to
          the absolutely physical point of view, which leads to the result:
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">edite</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">bibite</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">post mortem nulla voluptas</span></span>, and
          so far may be defined as bestialism.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">However, after
          all that has been taught concerning death, it cannot be denied
          that, at least in Europe, the opinion of men, nay, often even of
          the same individual, very frequently vacillates between the
          conception of death as absolute annihilation and the assumption
          that we are, as it were, with skin and hair, immortal. Both are
          equally false: but we have not so much to find a correct mean as
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page251">[pg 251]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg251"></a> rather to gain the
          higher point of view from which such notions disappear of
          themselves.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In these
          considerations I shall first of all start from the purely empirical
          standpoint. Here there primarily lies before us the undeniable fact
          that, according to the natural consciousness, man not only fears
          death for his own person more than anything else, but also weeps
          violently over the death of those that belong to him, and indeed
          clearly not egotistically, for his own loss, but out of sympathy
          for the great misfortune that has befallen them. Therefore he also
          censures those who in such a case neither weep nor show sadness as
          hard-hearted and unloving. It is parallel with this that revenge,
          in its highest degree, seeks the death of the adversary as the
          greatest evil that can be inflicted. Opinions change with time and
          place; but the voice of nature remains always and everywhere the
          same, and is therefore to be heeded before everything else. Now
          here it seems distinctly to say that death is a great evil. In the
          language of nature death means annihilation. And that death is a
          serious matter may be concluded from the fact that, as every one
          knows, life is no joke. We must indeed deserve nothing better than
          these two.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In fact, the
          fear of death is independent of all knowledge; for the brute has
          it, although it does not know death. Everything that is born brings
          it with it into the world. But this fear of death is <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span> only the reverse side
          of the will to live, which indeed we all are. Therefore in every
          brute the fear of its destruction is inborn, like the care for its
          maintenance. Thus it is the fear of death, and not the mere
          avoidance of pain, which shows itself in the anxious carefulness
          with which the brute seeks to protect itself, and still more its
          brood, from everything that might become dangerous. Why does the
          brute flee, trembling, and seek to conceal itself? Because it is
          simply the will to live, but, as such, is forfeited to death, and
          wishes to gain time. Such also, by nature, is man. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page252">[pg 252]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg252"></a> The greatest evil, the worst that can
          anywhere threaten, is death; the greatest fear is the fear of
          death. Nothing excites us so irresistibly to the most lively
          interest as danger to the life of others; nothing is so shocking as
          an execution. Now the boundless attachment to life which appears
          here cannot have sprung from knowledge and reflection; to these it
          rather appears foolish, for the objective worth of life is very
          uncertain, and at least it remains doubtful whether it is
          preferable to not being, nay, if experience and reflection come to
          be expressed, not being must certainly win. If one knocked on the
          graves, and asked the dead whether they wished to rise again, they
          would shake their heads. Such is the opinion of Socrates in
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Plato's Apology,”</span> and even the gay
          and amiable Voltaire cannot help saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">On aime la vie; mais le néant
          ne laisse pas d'avoir du bon</span></span>;”</span> and again,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">Je ne sais pas ce
          que c'est que la vie éternelle, mais celle-ci est une mauvaise
          plaisanterie</span></span>.”</span> Besides, life must in any case
          soon end; so that the few years which perhaps one has yet to be
          vanish entirely before the endless time when one will be no more.
          Accordingly it appears to reflection even ludicrous to be so
          anxious about this span of time, to tremble so much if our own life
          or that of another is in danger, and to compose tragedies the
          horror of which has its strength in the fear of death. That
          powerful attachment to life is therefore irrational and blind; it
          can only be explained from the fact that our whole inner nature is
          itself will to live, to which, therefore, life must appear as the
          highest good, however embittered, short, and uncertain it may
          always be; and that that will, in itself and originally, is
          unconscious and blind. Knowledge, on the contrary, far from being
          the source of that attachment to life, even works against it, for
          it discloses the worthlessness of life, and thus combats the fear
          of death. When it conquers, and accordingly the man faces death
          courageously and composedly, this is honoured as great and noble,
          thus we hail then the triumph of knowledge over the blind will to
          live, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page253">[pg 253]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg253"></a> which is yet the
          kernel of our own being. In the same way we despise him in whom
          knowledge is defeated in that conflict, and who therefore clings
          unconditionally to life, struggles to the utmost against
          approaching death, and receives it with despair;<a href="#note_28" id="noteref_28" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">28</span></span></a> and
          yet in him it is only the most original being of ourselves and of
          nature that expresses itself. We may here ask, in passing, how
          could this boundless love of life and endeavour to maintain it in
          every way as long as possible be regarded as base, contemptible,
          and by the adherents of every religion as unworthy of this, if it
          were the gift of good gods, to be recognised with thankfulness? And
          how could it then seem great and noble to esteem it lightly?
          Meanwhile, what is confirmed by these considerations is—(1.) that
          the will to live is the inmost nature of man; (2.) that in itself
          it is unconscious and blind; (3.) that knowledge is an adventitious
          principle, which is originally foreign to the will; (4.) that
          knowledge conflicts with the will, and that our judgment applauds
          the victory of knowledge over the will.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If what makes
          death seem so terrible to us were the thought of not being, we
          would necessarily think with equal horror of the time when as yet
          we were not. For it is irrefutably certain that not being after
          death cannot be different from not being before birth, and
          consequently is also no more deplorable. A whole eternity has run
          its course while as yet we were not, but that by no means disturbs
          us. On the other hand, we find it hard, nay, unendurable, that
          after the momentary intermezzo of an ephemeral existence, a second
          eternity should follow in which we shall no longer be. Should,
          then, this thirst for existence have arisen because we have now
          tasted it and have found it so delightful? As was already briefly
          explained above, certainly not; far sooner <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page254">[pg 254]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg254"></a> could the experience gained have awakened an
          infinite longing for the lost paradise of non-existence. To the
          hope, also, of the immortality of the soul there is always added
          that of a <span class="tei tei-q">“better world”</span>—a sign that
          the present world is not much good. Notwithstanding all this, the
          question as to our state after death has certainly been discussed,
          in books and verbally, ten thousand times oftener than the question
          as to our state before birth. Yet theoretically the one is just as
          near at hand and as fair a problem as the other; and besides,
          whoever had answered the one would soon see to the bottom of the
          other. We have fine declamations about how shocking it would be to
          think that the mind of man, which embraces the world, and has so
          many very excellent thoughts, should sink with him into the grave;
          but we hear nothing about this mind having allowed a whole eternity
          to pass before it came into being with these its qualities, and how
          the world must have had to do without it all that time. Yet no
          question presents itself more naturally to knowledge, uncorrupted
          by the will, than this: An infinite time has passed before my
          birth; what was I during this time? Metaphysically, it might
          perhaps be answered, <span class="tei tei-q">“I was always I; that
          is, all who during that time said I, were just I.”</span> But let
          us look away from this to our present entirely empirical point of
          view, and assume that I did not exist at all. Then I can console
          myself as to the infinite time after my death, when I shall not be,
          with the infinite time when I already was not, as a
          well-accustomed, and indeed very comfortable, state. For the
          eternity <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a parte post</span></span>
          without me can be just as little fearful as the eternity
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a parte ante</span></span> without me, since
          the two are distinguished by nothing except by the interposition of
          an ephemeral dream of life. All proofs, also, for continued
          existence after death may just as well be applied <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">in partem ante</span></span>, where they then
          demonstrate existence before life, in the assumption of which the
          Hindus and Buddhists therefore show themselves very consistent.
          Kant's ideality of time <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page255">[pg
          255]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg255"></a>
          alone solves all these riddles. But we are not speaking of that
          now. This, however, results from what has been said, that to mourn
          for the time when one will be no more is just as absurd as it would
          be to mourn over the time when as yet one was not; for it is all
          the same whether the time which our existence does not fill is
          related to that which it does fill, as future or as past.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But, also,
          regarded entirely apart from these temporal considerations, it is
          in and for itself absurd to look upon not being as an evil; for
          every evil, as every good, presupposes existence, nay, even
          consciousness: but the latter ceases with life, as also in sleep
          and in a swoon; therefore the absence of it is well known to us,
          and trusted, as containing no evil at all: its entrance, however,
          is always an affair of a moment. From this point of view Epicurus
          considered death, and therefore quite rightly said, <span class="tei tei-q">“ὁ θανατος μηδεν προς ἡμας”</span> (Death does not
          concern us); with the explanation that when we are death is not,
          and when death is we are not (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Diog. Laert.</span></span>, x. 27). To have
          lost what cannot be missed is clearly no evil. Therefore ceasing to
          be ought to disturb us as little as not having been. Accordingly
          from the standpoint of knowledge there appears absolutely no reason
          to fear death. But consciousness consists in knowing; therefore,
          for consciousness death is no evil. Moreover, it is really not this
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">knowing</span></em> part of our <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ego</span></em>
          that fears death, but the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">fuga
          mortis</span></span> proceeds entirely and alone from the blind
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em>, of which everything living
          is filled. To this, however, as was already mentioned above, it is
          essential, just because it is will to live, whose whole nature
          consists in the effort after life and existence, and which is not
          originally endowed with knowledge, but only in consequence of its
          objectification in animal individuals. If now the will, by means of
          knowledge, beholds death as the end of the phenomenon with which it
          has identified itself, and to which, therefore, it sees itself
          limited, its whole nature struggles against it with all its might.
          Whether now it has really something <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page256">[pg 256]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg256"></a> to fear from death we will investigate
          further on, and will then remember the real source of the fear of
          death, which has been shown here along with the requisite
          distinction of the willing and the knowing part of our nature.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Corresponding to
          this, then, what makes death so terrible to us is not so much the
          end of life—for this can appear to no one specially worthy of
          regret—but rather the destruction of the organism; really because
          this is the will itself exhibiting itself as body. But we only
          really feel this destruction in the evils of disease or of old age;
          death itself, on the other hand, consists for the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">subject</span></em>
          only in the moment when consciousness vanishes because the activity
          of the brain ceases. The extension of the stoppage to all the other
          parts of the organism which follows this is really already an event
          after death. Thus death, in a subjective regard, concerns the
          consciousness alone. Now what the vanishing of this may be every
          one can to a certain extent judge of from going to sleep; but it is
          still better known to whoever has really fainted, for in this the
          transition is not so gradual, nor accompanied by dreams, but first
          the power of sight leaves us, still fully conscious, and then
          immediately the most profound unconsciousness enters; the sensation
          that accompanies it, so far as it goes, is anything but
          disagreeable; and without doubt, as sleep is the brother of death,
          so the swoon is its twin-brother. Even violent death cannot be
          painful, for even severe wounds are not felt at all till some time
          afterwards, often not till the outward signs of them are observed.
          If they are rapidly mortal, consciousness will vanish before this
          discovery; if they result in death later, then it is the same as
          with other illnesses. All those also who have lost consciousness in
          water, or from charcoal fumes, or through hanging are well known to
          say that it happened without pain. And now, finally, the death
          which is properly in accordance with nature, death from old age,
          euthanasia, is a gradual vanishing and sinking out of existence in
          an imperceptible manner. Little by <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page257">[pg 257]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg257"></a> little in old age, the passions and desires,
          with the susceptibility for their objects, are extinguished; the
          emotions no longer find anything to excite them; for the power of
          presenting ideas to the mind always becomes weaker, its images
          fainter; the impressions no longer cleave to us, but pass over
          without leaving a trace, the days roll ever faster, events lose
          their significance, everything grows pale. The old man stricken in
          years totters about or rests in a corner now only a shadow, a ghost
          of his former self. What remains there for death to destroy? One
          day a sleep is his last, and his dreams are ——. They are the dreams
          which Hamlet inquires after in the famous soliloquy. I believe we
          dream them even now.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I have here also
          to remark that the maintenance of the life process, although it has
          a metaphysical basis, does not go on without resistance, and
          consequently not without effort. It is this to which the organism
          yields every night, on account of which it then suspends the brain
          function and diminishes certain secretions, the respiration, the
          pulse, and the development of heat. From this we may conclude that
          the entire ceasing of the life process must be a wonderful relief
          to its motive force; perhaps this has some share in the expression
          of sweet contentment on the faces of most dead persons. In general
          the moment of death may be like the moment of awaking from a heavy
          dream that has oppressed us like a nightmare.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Up to this point
          the result we have arrived at is that death, however much it may be
          feared, can yet really be no evil. But often it even appears as a
          good thing, as something wished for, as a friend. All that have met
          with insuperable obstacles to their existence or their efforts,
          that suffer from incurable diseases or inconsolable griefs, have as
          a last refuge, which generally opens to them of its own accord, the
          return into the womb of nature, from which they arose for a short
          time, enticed by the hope of more favourable conditions of
          existence <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page258">[pg
          258]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg258"></a>
          than have fallen to their lot, and the same path out of which
          constantly remains open. That return is the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">cessio bonorum</span></span> of life. Yet even
          here it is only entered upon after a physical and moral conflict:
          so hard does one struggle against returning to the place from which
          one came out so lightly and readily, to an existence which has so
          much suffering and so little pleasure to offer. The Hindus give the
          god of death, Yama, two faces; one very fearful and terrible, and
          one very cheerful and benevolent. This partly explains itself from
          the reflections we have just made.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the empirical
          point of view at which we still stand, the following consideration
          is one which presents itself of its own accord, and therefore
          deserves to be accurately defined by illustration, and thereby
          referred to its proper limits. The sight of a dead body shows me
          that sensibility, irritability, circulation of the blood,
          reproduction, &amp;c., have here ceased. I conclude from this with
          certainty that what actuated these hitherto, which was yet always
          something unknown to me, now actuates them no longer, thus has
          departed from them. But if I should now wish to add that this must
          have been just what I have known only as consciousness,
          consequently as intelligence (soul), this would be not only an
          unjustified but clearly a false conclusion. For consciousness has
          always showed itself to me not as the cause, but as the product and
          result of the organised life, for it rose and sank in consequence
          of this in the different periods of life, in health and sickness,
          in sleep, in a swoon, in awaking, &amp;c., thus always appeared as
          effect, never as cause of the organised life, always showed itself
          as something which arises and passes away, and again arises, so
          long as the conditions of this still exist, but not apart from
          them. Nay, I may also have seen that the complete derangement of
          consciousness, madness, far from dragging down with it and
          depressing the other forces, or indeed endangering life, heightens
          these very much, especially irritability or muscular force,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page259">[pg 259]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg259"></a> and rather lengthens
          than shortens life, if other causes do not come in. Then, also: I
          knew individuality as a quality of everything organised, and
          therefore, if this is a self-conscious organism, also of
          consciousness. But there exists no occasion now to conclude that
          individuality was inherent in that vanished principle, which
          imparts life, and is completely unknown to me; all the less so as I
          see that everywhere in nature each particular phenomenon is the
          work of a general force which is active in thousands of similar
          phenomena. But, on the other hand, there is just as little occasion
          to conclude that because the organised life has ceased here that
          force which hitherto actuated it has also become nothing; as little
          as to infer the death of the spinner from the stopping of the
          spinning-wheel. If a pendulum, by finding its centre of gravity, at
          last comes to rest, and thus its individual apparent life has
          ceased, no one will imagine that gravitation is now annihilated;
          but every one comprehends that, after as before, it is active in
          innumerable phenomena. Certainly it might be urged against this
          comparison, that here also, in this pendulum, gravitation has not
          ceased to be active, but only to manifest its activity palpably;
          whoever insists on this may think, instead, of an electrical body,
          in which, after its discharge, electricity has actually ceased to
          be active. I only wished to show in this that we ourselves
          recognise in the lowest forces of nature an eternity and ubiquity
          with regard to which the transitory nature of their fleeting
          phenomena never makes us err for a moment. So much the less, then,
          should it come into our mind to regard the ceasing of life as the
          annihilation of the living principle, and consequently death as the
          entire destruction of the man. Because the strong arm which, three
          thousand years ago, bent the bow of Ulysses is no more, no
          reflective and well-regulated understanding will regard the force
          which acted so energetically in it as entirely annihilated, and
          therefore, upon further reflection, will also not assume that the
          force which bends the bow to-day first <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page260">[pg 260]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg260"></a> began with this arm. The thought lies far
          nearer us, that the force which earlier actuated the life which now
          has vanished is the same which is active in the life which now
          flourishes: nay, this is almost inevitable. Certainly, however, we
          know that, as was explained in the second book, only that is
          perishable which is involved in the causal series; but only the
          states and forms are so involved. On the other hand, untouched by
          the change of these which is introduced by causes, there remain on
          the one side matter, and on the other side natural forces: for both
          are the presupposition of all these changes. But the principle of
          our life we must, primarily at least, conceive as a force of
          nature, until perhaps a more profound investigation has brought us
          to know what it is in itself. Thus, taken simply as a force of
          nature, the vital force remains entirely undisturbed by the change
          of forms and states, which the bond of cause and effect introduces
          and carries off again, and which alone are subject to the process
          of coming into being and passing away, as it lies before us in
          experience. Thus so far the imperishable nature of our true being
          can be proved with certainty. But it is true this will not satisfy
          the claims which are wont to be made upon proofs of our continued
          existence after death, nor insure the consolation which is expected
          from such proofs. However, it is always something; and whoever
          fears death as an absolute annihilation cannot afford to despise
          the perfect certainty that the inmost principle of his life remains
          untouched by it. Nay, the paradox might be set up, that that second
          thing also which, just like the forces of nature, remains untouched
          by the continual change under the guidance of causality, thus
          matter, by its absolute permanence, insures us indestructibility,
          by virtue of which whoever was incapable of comprehending any other
          might yet confidently trust in a certain imperishableness.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“What!”</span> it will be said,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the permanence of the mere dust, of the
          crude matter, is to be regarded as a continuance of our
          being?”</span> Oh! do you know this dust, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page261">[pg 261]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg261"></a> then? Do you know what it is and what it can
          do? Learn to know it before you despise it. This matter which now
          lies there as dust and ashes will soon, dissolved in water, form
          itself as a crystal, will shine as metal, will then emit electric
          sparks, will by means of its galvanic intensity manifest a force
          which, decomposing the closest combinations, reduces earths to
          metals; nay, it will, of its own accord, form itself into plants
          and animals, and from its mysterious womb develop that life for the
          loss of which you, in your narrowness, are so painfully anxious. Is
          it, then, absolutely nothing to continue to exist as such matter?
          Nay, I seriously assert that even this permanence of matter affords
          evidence of the indestructibility of our true nature, though only
          as in an image or simile, or, rather, only as in outline. To see
          this we only need to call to mind the explanation of matter given
          in chapter 24, from which it resulted that mere formless
          matter—this basis of the world of experience which is never
          perceived for itself alone, but assumed as constantly remaining—is
          the immediate reflection, the visibility in general, of the thing
          in itself, thus of the will. Therefore, whatever absolutely
          pertains to the will as such holds good also of matter, and it
          reflects the true eternal nature of the will under the image of
          temporal imperishableness. Because, as has been said, nature does
          not lie, no view which has sprung from a purely objective
          comprehension of it, and been logically thought out, can be
          absolutely false, but at the most only very one-sided and
          imperfect. Such, however, is, indisputably, consistent materialism;
          for instance, that of Epicurus, just as well as the absolute
          idealism opposed to it, like that of Berkeley, and in general every
          philosophical point of view which has proceeded from a correct
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">apperçu</span></span>, and been honestly
          carried out. Only they are all exceedingly one-sided
          comprehensions, and therefore, in spite of their opposition, they
          are all true, each from a definite point of view; but as soon as
          one has risen above this point of view, then they only <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page262">[pg 262]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg262"></a> appear as relatively and conditionally
          true. The highest standpoint alone, from which one surveys them all
          and knows them in their relative truth, but also beyond this, in
          their falseness, can be that of absolute truth so far as this is in
          general attainable. Accordingly we see, as was shown above, that in
          the very crude, and therefore very old, point of view of
          materialism proper the indestructibility of our true nature in
          itself is represented, as by a mere shadow of it, the
          imperishableness of matter; as in the already higher naturalism of
          an absolute physics it is represented by the ubiquity and eternity
          of the natural forces, among which the vital force is at least to
          be counted. Thus even these crude points of view contain the
          assertion that the living being suffers no absolute annihilation
          through death, but continues to exist in and with the whole of
          nature.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
          considerations which have brought us to this point, and to which
          the further explanations link themselves on, started from the
          remarkable fear of death which fills all living beings. But now we
          will change the standpoint and consider how, in contrast to the
          individual beings, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">whole</span></em> of nature bears itself with
          reference to death. In doing this, however, we still always remain
          upon the ground of experience.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Certainly we
          know no higher game of chance than that for death and life. Every
          decision about this we watch with the utmost excitement, interest,
          and fear; for in our eyes all in all is at stake. On the other
          hand, nature, which never lies, but is always straightforward and
          open, speaks quite differently upon this theme, speaks like Krishna
          in the Bhagavadgita. What it says is: The death or the life of the
          individual is of no significance. It expresses this by the fact
          that it exposes the life of every brute, and even of man, to the
          most insignificant accidents without coming to the rescue. Consider
          the insect on your path; a slight, unconscious turning of your step
          is decisive as to its life or death. Look at the wood-snail,
          without any means of flight, of defence, of deception, of
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page263">[pg 263]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg263"></a> concealment, a ready
          prey for all. Look at the fish carelessly playing in the still open
          net; the frog restrained by its laziness from the flight which
          might save it; the bird that does not know of the falcon that soars
          above it; the sheep which the wolf eyes and examines from the
          thicket. All these, provided with little foresight, go about
          guilelessly among the dangers that threaten their existence every
          moment. Since now nature exposes its organisms, constructed with
          such inimitable skill, not only to the predatory instincts of the
          stronger, but also to the blindest chance, to the humour of every
          fool, the mischievousness of every child without reserve, it
          declares that the annihilation of these individuals is indifferent
          to it, does it no harm, has no significance, and that in these
          cases the effect is of no more importance than the cause. It says
          this very distinctly, and it does not lie; only it makes no
          comments on its utterances, but rather expresses them in the
          laconic style of an oracle. If now the all-mother sends forth her
          children without protection to a thousand threatening dangers, this
          can only be because she knows that if they fall they fall back into
          her womb, where they are safe; therefore their fall is a mere jest.
          Nature does not act otherwise with man than with the brutes.
          Therefore its declaration extends also to man: the life and death
          of the individual are indifferent to it. Accordingly, in a certain
          sense, they ought also to be indifferent to us, for we ourselves
          are indeed nature. Certainly, if only we saw deep enough, we would
          agree with nature, and regard life and death as indifferently as it
          does. Meanwhile, by means of reflection, we must attribute that
          carelessness and indifference of nature towards the life of the
          individuals to the fact that the destruction of such a phenomenon
          does not in the least affect its true and proper nature.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If we further
          ponder the fact, that not only, as we have just seen, are life and
          death dependent upon the most trifling accidents, but that the
          existence of the organised being in general is an ephemeral one,
          that <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page264">[pg 264]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg264"></a> animal and plant
          arise to-day and pass away to-morrow, and birth and death follow in
          quick succession, while to the unorganised things which stand so
          much lower an incomparably longer duration is assured, and an
          infinite duration to the absolutely formless matter alone, to
          which, indeed, we attribute this <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          priori</span></span>,—then, I think, the thought must follow of its
          own accord, even from the purely empirical, but objective and
          unprejudiced comprehension of such an order of things, that this is
          only a superficial phenomenon, that such a constant arising and
          passing away can by no means touch the root of things, but can only
          be relative, nay, only apparent, in which the true inner nature of
          that thing is not included, the nature which everywhere evades our
          glance and is thoroughly mysterious, but rather that this continues
          to exist undisturbed by it; although we can neither apprehend nor
          conceive the manner in which this happens, and must therefore think
          of it only generally as a kind of <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">tour de passe-passe</span></span> which took
          place there. For that, while what is most imperfect, the lowest,
          the unorganised, continues to exist unassailed, it is just the most
          perfect beings, the living creatures, with their infinitely
          complicated and inconceivably ingenious organisations, which
          constantly arise, new from the very foundation, and after a brief
          span of time absolutely pass into nothingness, to make room for
          other new ones like them coming into existence out of nothing—this
          is something so obviously absurd that it can never be the true
          order of things, but rather a mere veil which conceals this, or,
          more accurately, a phenomenon conditioned by the nature of our
          intellect. Nay, the whole being and not being itself of these
          individuals, in relation to which death and life are opposites, can
          only be relative. Thus the language of nature, in which it is given
          us as absolute, cannot be the true and ultimate expression of the
          nature of things and of the order of the world, but indeed only a
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">patois du pays</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          something merely relatively true,—something to be understood
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page265">[pg 265]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg265"></a> <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">cum grano salis</span></span>, or, to speak
          properly, something conditioned by our intellect; I say, an
          immediate, intuitive conviction of the kind which I have tried to
          describe in words will press itself upon every one; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          certainly only upon every one whose mind is not of an utterly
          ordinary species, which is absolutely only capable of knowing the
          particular simply and solely as such, which is strictly limited to
          the knowledge of individuals, after the manner of the intellect of
          the brutes. Whoever, on the other hand, by means of a capacity of
          an only somewhat higher power, even just begins to see in the
          individual beings their universal, their Ideas, will also, to a
          certain extent, participate in that conviction, and that indeed as
          an immediate, and therefore certain, conviction. In fact, it is
          also only small, limited minds that fear death quite seriously as
          their annihilation, and persons of decidedly superior capacity are
          completely free from such terrors. Plato rightly bases the whole of
          philosophy upon the knowledge of the doctrine of Ideas,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, upon the perception of the
          universal in the particular. But the conviction here described,
          which proceeds directly from the comprehension of nature, must have
          been exceedingly vivid in those sublime authors of the Upanishads
          of the Vedas, who can scarcely be thought of as mere men, for it
          speaks to us so forcibly out of an innumerable number of their
          utterances that we must ascribe this immediate illumination of
          their mind to the fact that these wise men, standing nearer the
          origin of our race in time, comprehended the nature of things more
          clearly and profoundly than the already deteriorated race, ὁιοι νυν
          βροτοι εισιν, is able to do. But certainly their comprehension is
          assisted by the natural world of India, which is endowed with life
          in a very different degree from our northern world. However,
          thorough reflection, as pursued by Kant's great mind, leads by
          another path to the same result, for it teaches us that our
          intellect, in which that phenomenal world which changes so fast
          exhibits <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page266">[pg
          266]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg266"></a>
          itself, does not comprehend the true ultimate nature of things, but
          merely its phenomenal manifestation, and indeed, as I add, because
          it is originally only destined to present the motives to our will,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, to be serviceable to it in
          the pursuit of its paltry ends.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Let us, however,
          carry our objective and unprejudiced consideration of nature still
          further. If I kill a living creature, whether a dog, a bird, a
          frog, or even only an insect, it is really inconceivable that this
          being, or rather the original force by virtue of which such a
          marvellous phenomenon exhibited itself just the moment before, in
          its full energy and love of life, should have been annihilated by
          my wicked or thoughtless act. And again, on the other hand, the
          millions of animals of every kind which come into existence every
          moment, in infinite variety, full of force and activity, can never,
          before the act of their generation, have been nothing at all, and
          have attained from nothing to an absolute beginning. If now in this
          way I see one of these withdraw itself from my sight, without me
          knowing where it goes, and another appear without me knowing whence
          it comes; if, moreover, both have the same form, the same nature,
          the same character, and only not the same matter, which yet during
          their existence they continually throw off and renew; then
          certainly the assumption, that that which vanishes and that which
          appears in its place are one and the same, which has only
          experienced a slight alteration, a renewal of the form of its
          existence, and that consequently death is for the species what
          sleep is for the individual; this assumption, I say, lies so close
          at hand that it is impossible not to light upon it, unless the
          mind, perverted in early youth by the imprinting of false views,
          hurries it out of the way, even from a distance, with superstitious
          fear. But the opposite assumption that the birth of an animal is an
          arising out of nothing, and accordingly that its death is its
          absolute annihilation, and this with the further addition that man,
          who has also originated out <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page267">[pg 267]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg267"></a> of nothing, has yet an individual, endless
          existence, and indeed a conscious existence, while the dog, the
          ape, the elephant, are annihilated by death, is really something
          against which the healthy mind revolts and which it must regard as
          absurd. If, as is sufficiently often repeated, the comparison of
          the results of a system with the utterances of the healthy mind is
          supposed to be a touchstone of its truth, I wish the adherents of
          the system which was handed down from Descartes to the pre-Kantian
          eclectics, nay, which even now is still the prevailing view of the
          great majority of cultured people in Europe, would apply this
          touchstone here.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Throughout and
          everywhere the true symbol of nature is the circle, because it is
          the schema or type of recurrence. This is, in fact, the most
          universal form in nature, which it carries out in everything, from
          the course of the stars down to the death and the genesis of
          organised beings, and by which alone, in the ceaseless stream of
          time, and its content, a permanent existence, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, a
          nature, becomes possible.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If in autumn we
          consider the little world of insects, and see how one prepares its
          bed to sleep the long, rigid winter-sleep; another spins its cocoon
          to pass the winter as a chrysalis, and awake in spring rejuvenated
          and perfected; and, finally, how most of them, intending themselves
          to rest in the arms of death, merely arrange with care the suitable
          place for their egg, in order to issue forth again from it some day
          renewed;—this is nature's great doctrine of immortality, which
          seeks to teach us that there is no radical difference between sleep
          and death, but the one endangers existence just as little as the
          other. The care with which the insect prepares a cell, or hole, or
          nest, deposits its egg in it, together with food for the larva that
          will come out of it in the following spring, and then quietly dies,
          is just like the care with which in the evening a man lays ready
          his clothes and his breakfast for the next morning, and then
          quietly goes to sleep; and at <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page268">[pg 268]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg268"></a> bottom it could not take place at all if it
          were not that the insect which dies in autumn is in itself, and
          according to its true nature, just as much identical with the one
          which is hatched out in the spring as the man who lies down to
          sleep is identical with the man who rises from it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If now, after
          these considerations, we return to ourselves and our own species,
          then cast our glance forward far into the future, and seek to
          present to our minds the future generations, with the millions of
          their individuals in the strange form of their customs and
          pursuits, and then interpose with the question: Whence will all
          these come? Where are they now? Where is the fertile womb of that
          nothing, pregnant with worlds, which still conceals the coming
          races? Would not the smiling and true answer to this be, Where else
          should they be than there where alone the real always was and will
          be, in the present and its content?—thus with thee, the foolish
          questioner, who in this mistaking of his own nature is like the
          leaf upon the tree, which, fading in autumn and about to fall,
          complains at its destruction, and will not be consoled by looking
          forward to the fresh green which will clothe the tree in spring,
          but says lamenting, <span class="tei tei-q">“I am not these! These
          are quite different leaves!”</span> Oh, foolish leaf! Whither wilt
          thou? And whence should others come? Where is the nothing whose
          abyss thou fearest? Know thine own nature, that which is so filled
          with thirst for existence; recognise it in the inner, mysterious,
          germinating force of the tree, which, constantly <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> and
          the same in all generations of leaves, remains untouched by all
          arising and passing away. And now, οἱη περ φυλλων γενεη, τοιηδε και
          ανδρων (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Qualis foliorum generatio,
          talis et hominum</span></span>). Whether the fly which now buzzes
          round me goes to sleep in the evening, and buzzes again tomorrow,
          or dies in the evening, and in spring another fly buzzes which has
          sprung from its egg: that is in itself the same thing; but
          therefore the knowledge which exhibits this as two fundamentally
          different things is not <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page269">[pg
          269]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg269"></a>
          unconditioned, but relative, a knowledge of the phenomenon, not of
          the thing in itself. In the morning the fly exists again; it also
          exists again in the spring. What distinguishes for it the winter
          from the night? In Burdach's <span class="tei tei-q">“Physiology,”</span> vol. i. § 275, we read,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Till ten o'clock in the morning no
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Cercaria ephemera</span></span> (one of the
          infusoria) is to be seen (in the infusion), and at twelve the whole
          water swarms with them. In the evening they die, and the next
          morning they again appear anew.”</span> So it was observed by
          Nitzsch six days running.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So everything
          lingers but a moment, and hastens on to death. The plant and the
          insect die at the end of the summer, the brute and the man after a
          few years: death reaps unweariedly. Yet notwithstanding this, nay,
          as if this were not so at all, everything is always there and in
          its place, just as if everything were imperishable. The plant
          always thrives and blooms, the insect hums, the brute and the man
          exist in unwasted youth, and the cherries that have already been
          enjoyed a thousand times we have again before us every summer. The
          nations also exist as immortal individuals, although sometimes
          their names change; even their action, what they do and suffer, is
          always the same; although history always pretends to relate
          something different: for it is like the kaleidoscope, which at
          every turn shows a new figure, while we really always have the same
          thing before our eyes. What then presses itself more irresistibly
          upon us than the thought that that arising and passing away does
          not concern the real nature of things, but this remains untouched
          by it, thus is imperishable, and therefore all and each that
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">wills</span></em> to exist actually exists
          continuously and without end. Accordingly at every given point of
          time all species of animals, from the gnat to the elephant, exist
          together complete. They have already renewed themselves many
          thousand times, and withal have remained the same. They know
          nothing of others like them, who have lived before them,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page270">[pg 270]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg270"></a> or will live after
          them; it is the species which always lives, and in the
          consciousness of the imperishable nature of the species and their
          identity with it the individuals cheerfully exist. The will to live
          manifests itself in an endless present, because this is the form of
          the life of the species, which, therefore, never grows old, but
          remains always young. Death is for it what sleep is for the
          individual, or what winking is for the eye, by the absence of which
          the Indian gods are known, if they appear in human form. As through
          the entrance of night the world vanishes, but yet does not for a
          moment cease to exist, so man and brute apparently pass away
          through death, and yet their true nature continues, just as
          undisturbed by it. Let us now think of that alternation of death
          and birth as infinitely rapid vibrations, and we have before us the
          enduring objectification of the will, the permanent Ideas of being,
          fixed like the rainbow on the waterfall. This is temporal
          immortality. In consequence of this, notwithstanding thousands of
          years of death and decay, nothing has been lost, not an atom of the
          matter, still less anything of the inner being, that exhibits
          itself as nature. Therefore every moment we can cheerfully cry,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“In spite of time, death, and decay, we are
          still all together!”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Perhaps we would
          have to except whoever had once said from the bottom of his heart,
          with regard to this game, <span class="tei tei-q">“I want no
          more.”</span> But this is not yet the place to speak of this.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But we have
          certainly to draw attention to the fact that the pain of birth and
          the bitterness of death are the two constant conditions under which
          the will to live maintains itself in its objectification,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, our inner nature,
          untouched by the course of time and the death of races, exists in
          an everlasting present, and enjoys the fruit of the assertion of
          the will to live. This is analogous to the fact that we can only be
          awake during the day on condition that we sleep during the night;
          indeed the latter is the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page271">[pg
          271]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg271"></a>
          commentary which nature offers us for the understanding of that
          difficult passage.<a href="#note_29" id="noteref_29" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">29</span></span></a></p>

          substratum, or the content, πληρωμα, or the material of the

          really the same. The impossibility of knowing this identity
          directly is just <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">time</span></em>, a form and limitation of our
          intellect. That on account of it, for example, the future event is
          not yet, depends upon an illusion of which we become conscious when
          that event has come. That the essential form of our intellect
          introduces such an illusion explains and justifies itself from the
          fact that the intellect has come forth from the hands of nature by
          no means for the apprehension of the nature of things, but merely
          for the apprehension of motives, thus for the service of an

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The very
          remarkable and, in its place, astonishing passage in Diderot's
          <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Jacques le fataliste</span></span>,”</span>
          deserves not less to be mentioned here: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">Un château immense, au
          frontispice duquel on lisait:</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-style: italic">‹ </span><span style="font-style: italic">Je n'appartiens à personne, et j'appartiens à

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Certainly in the
          sense in which, when he is begotten, the man arises out of nothing,
          he becomes nothing through death. But really to learn to know this
          <span class="tei tei-q">“nothing”</span> would be very interesting;
          for it only requires moderate acuteness to see that this empirical
          nothing is by no means absolute, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          such as would in every sense be nothing. We are already led to this
          insight by the observation that all qualities of the parents recur
          in the children, thus have overcome death. Of this, however, I will
          speak in a special chapter.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is no
          greater contrast than that between the ceaseless flight of time,
          which carries its whole content with it, and the rigid immobility
          of what is actually present, which at all times is one and the
          same. And if from this point of view we watch in a purely objective
          manner the immediate events of life, the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Nunc stans</span></span> becomes clear
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page273">[pg 273]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg273"></a> and visible to us in
          the centre of the wheel of time. To the eye of a being of
          incomparably longer life, which at <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em>
          glance comprehended the human race in its whole duration, the
          constant alternation of birth and death would present itself as a
          continuous vibration, and accordingly it would not occur to it at
          all to see in this an ever new arising out of nothing and passing
          into nothing; but just as to our sight the quickly revolving spark
          appears as a continuous circle, the rapidly vibrating spring as a
          permanent triangle, the vibrating cord as a spindle, so to this eye
          the species would appear as that which has being and permanence,
          death and life as vibrations.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We will have
          false conceptions of the indestructibility of our true nature by
          death, so long as we do not make up our minds to study it primarily
          in the brutes, but claim for ourselves alone a class apart from
          them, under the boastful name of immortality. But it is this
          pretension alone, and the narrowness of view from which it
          proceeds, on account of which most men struggle so obstinately
          against the recognition of the obvious truth that we are
          essentially, and in the chief respect, the same as the brutes; nay,
          that they recoil at every hint of our relationship with these. But
          it is this denial of the truth which more than anything else closes
          against them the path to real knowledge of the indestructibility of
          our nature. For if we seek anything upon a wrong path, we have just
          on that account forsaken the right path, and upon the path we
          follow we will never attain to anything in the end but late
          disillusion. Up, then, follow the truth, not according to
          preconceived notions, but as nature leads! First of all, learn to
          recognise in the aspect of every young animal the existence of the
          species that never grows old, which, as a reflection of its eternal
          youth, imparts to every individual a temporary youth, and lets it
          come forth as new and fresh as if the world were of to-day. Let one
          ask himself honestly whether the swallow of this year's spring is
          absolutely a different one from the swallow of the first spring,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page274">[pg 274]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg274"></a> and whether really
          between the two the miracle of the creation out of nothing has
          repeated itself millions of times, in order to work just as often
          into the hands of absolute annihilation. I know well that if I
          seriously assured any one that the cat which now plays in the yard
          is still the same one which made the same springs and played the
          same tricks there three hundred years ago, he would think I was
          mad; but I also know that it is much madder to believe that the cat
          of to-day is through and through and in its whole nature quite a
          different one from the cat of three hundred years ago. One only
          requires truly and seriously to sink oneself in the contemplation
          of one of these higher vertebrates in order to become distinctly
          conscious that this unfathomable nature, taken as a whole, as it
          exists there, cannot possibly become nothing; and yet, on the other
          hand, one knows its transitoriness. This depends upon the fact that
          in this animal the infinite nature of its Idea (species) is
          imprinted in the finiteness of the individual. For in a certain
          sense it is of course true that in the individual we always have
          before us another being—in the sense which depends upon the
          principle of sufficient reason, in which are also included time and
          space, which constitute the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium
          individuationis</span></span>. But in another sense it is not
          true—in the sense in which reality belongs to the permanent forms
          of things, the Ideas alone, and which was so clearly evident to
          Plato that it became his fundamental thought, the centre of his
          philosophy; and he made the comprehension of it the criterion of
          capacity for philosophising in general.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As the scattered
          drops of the roaring waterfall change with lightning rapidity,
          while the rainbow, whose supporter they are, remains immovably at
          rest, quite untouched by that ceaseless change, so every Idea,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, every species of living
          creature remains quite untouched by the continual change of its
          individuals. But it is the Idea, or the species in which the will
          to live is really rooted, and manifests itself; and therefore also
          the will <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page275">[pg
          275]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg275"></a>
          is only truly concerned in the continuance of the species. For
          example, the lions which are born and die are like the drops of the
          waterfall; but the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">leonitas</span></span>, the Idea or form of
          the lion, is like the unshaken rainbow upon it. Therefore Plato
          attributed true being to the Ideas alone, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          to the species; to the individuals only a ceaseless arising and
          passing away. From the profound consciousness of his imperishable
          nature really springs also the confidence and peace of mind with
          which every brute, and even human individual, moves unconcernedly
          along amid a host of chances, which may annihilate it any moment,
          and, moreover, moves straight on to death: out of its eyes,
          however, there shines the peace of the species, which that death
          does not affect, and does not concern. Even to man this peace could
          not be imparted by uncertain and changing dogmas. But, as was said,
          the contemplation of every animal teaches that death is no obstacle
          to the kernel of life, to the will in its manifestation. What an
          unfathomable mystery lies, then, in every animal! Look at the
          nearest one; look at your dog, how cheerfully and peacefully he
          lives! Many thousands of dogs have had to die before it came to
          this one's turn to live. But the death of these thousands has not
          affected the Idea of the dog; it has not been in the least
          disturbed by all that dying. Therefore the dog exists as fresh and
          endowed with primitive force as if this were its first day and none
          could ever be its last; and out of its eyes there shines the
          indestructible principle in it, the archæus. What, then, has died
          during those thousands of years? Not the dog—it stands unscathed
          before us; merely its shadow, its image in our form of knowledge,
          which is bound to time. Yet how can one even believe that that
          passes away which for ever and ever exists and fills all time?
          Certainly the matter can be explained empirically; in proportion as
          death destroyed the individuals, generation produced new ones. But
          this empirical explanation is only an apparent explanation: it puts
          one riddle in the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page276">[pg
          276]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg276"></a>
          place of the other. The metaphysical understanding of the matter,
          although not to be got so cheaply, is yet the only true and
          satisfying one.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Kant, in his
          subjective procedure, brought to light the truth that time cannot
          belong to the thing in itself, because it lies pre-formed in our
          apprehension. Now death is the temporal end of the temporal
          phenomenon; but as soon as we abstract time, there is no longer any
          end, and this word has lost all significance. But I, here upon the
          objective path, am trying to show the positive side of the matter,
          that the thing in itself remains untouched by time, and by that
          which is only possible through time, arising and passing away, and
          that the phenomena in time could not have even that ceaselessly
          fleeting existence which stands next to nothingness, if there were
          not in them a kernel of the infinite. Eternity is certainly a
          conception which has no perception as its foundation; accordingly
          it has also a merely negative content; it signifies a timeless
          existence. Time is yet merely an image of eternity, ὁ χρονος εἰκων
          τον αἰωνος, as Plotinus has it; and in the same way our temporal
          existence is a mere image of our true nature. This must lie in
          eternity, just because time is only the form of our knowledge; but
          on account of this alone do we know our own existence, and that of
          all things as transitory, finite, and subject to annihilation.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the second
          book I have shown that the adequate objectivity of the will as the
          thing in itself, at each of its grades, is the (Platonic) Idea;
          similarly in the third book that the Ideas of things have the pure
          subject of knowledge as their correlative; consequently the
          knowledge of them only appears exceptionally and temporarily under
          specially favourable conditions. For individual knowledge, on the
          other hand, thus in time, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Idea</span></em> presents itself under the
          form of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">species</span></em>, which is the Idea broken
          up through its entrance into time. Therefore the species is the
          most immediate objectification of the thing <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page277">[pg 277]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg277"></a> in itself, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          of the will to live. The inmost nature of every brute, and also of
          man, accordingly lies in the species; thus the will to live, which
          is so powerfully active, is rooted in this, not really in the
          individual. On the other hand, in the individual alone lies the
          immediate consciousness: accordingly it imagines itself different
          from the species, and therefore fears death. The will to live
          manifests itself in relation to the individual as hunger and the
          fear of death: in relation to the species as sexual instinct and
          passionate care for the offspring. In agreement with this we find
          nature, which is free from that delusion of the individual, as
          careful for the maintenance of the species as it is indifferent to
          the destruction of the individuals: the latter are always only
          means, the former is the end. Therefore a glaring contrast appears
          between its niggardliness in the endowment of the individuals and
          its prodigality when the species is concerned. In the latter case
          from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> individual are often annually
          obtained a hundred thousand germs, and more; for example, from
          trees, fishes, crabs, termites, and many others. In the former
          case, on the contrary, only barely enough in the way of powers and
          organs is given to each to enable it with ceaseless effort to
          maintain its life. And, therefore, if an animal is injured or
          weakened it must, as a rule, starve. And where an incidental saving
          was possible, through the circumstance that one part could upon
          necessity be dispensed with, it has been withheld, even out of
          order. Hence, for example, many caterpillars are without eyes; the
          poor creatures grope in the dark from leaf to leaf, which, since
          they lack feelers, they do by moving three-fourths of their body
          back and forward in the air, till they find some object. Hence they
          often miss their food which is to be found close by. But this
          happens in consequence of the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">lex parsimoniæ naturæ</span></span>, to the
          expression of which <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">natura nihil facit
          supervacaneum</span></span> one may add <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">et
          nihil largitur</span></span>. The same tendency of nature shows
          itself also in the fact that the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page278">[pg 278]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg278"></a> more fit the individual is, on account of his
          age, for the propagation of the species, the more powerfully does
          the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">vis naturæ
          medicatrix</span></span> manifest itself in him, and therefore his
          wounds heal easily, and he easily recovers from diseases. This
          diminishes along with the power of generation, and sinks low after
          it is extinct; for now in the eyes of nature the individual has
          become worthless.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If now we cast
          another glance at the scale of existences, with the whole of their
          accompanying gradations of consciousness, from the polyp up to man,
          we see this wonderful pyramid, kept in ceaseless oscillation
          certainly by the constant death of the individuals, yet by means of
          the bond of generation, enduring in the species through the
          infinite course of time. While, then, as was explained above, the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">objective</span></em>, the species, presents
          itself as indestructible, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">subjective</span></em>, which consists merely
          in the self-consciousness of these beings, seems to be of the
          shortest duration, and to be unceasingly destroyed, in order, just
          as often, to come forth again from nothing in an incomprehensible
          manner. But, indeed, one must be very short-sighted to let oneself
          be deceived by this appearance, and not to comprehend that,
          although the form of temporal permanence only belongs to the
          objective, the subjective, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the will, which lives and
          manifests itself in all, and with it the subject of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">knowledge</span></em> in which all exhibits
          itself, must be not less indestructible; because the permanence of
          the objective, or external, can yet only be the phenomenal
          appearance of the indestructibility of the subjective or internal;
          for the former can possess nothing which it has not received on
          loan from the latter; and cannot be essentially and originally an
          objective, a phenomenon, and then secondarily and accidentally a
          subjective, a thing in itself, a self-consciousness. For clearly
          the former as a manifestation presupposes something which manifests
          itself, as being for other presupposes a being for self, and as
          object presupposes a subject; and not conversely: because
          everywhere the root of things must <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page279">[pg 279]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg279"></a> lie in that which they are for themselves,
          thus in the subjective, not in the objective, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          in that which they are only for others, in a foreign consciousness.
          Accordingly we found in the first book that the right
          starting-point for philosophy is essentially and necessarily the
          subjective, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the idealistic
          starting-point; and also that the opposite starting-point, that
          which proceeds from the objective, leads to materialism. At bottom,
          however, we are far more one with the world than we commonly
          suppose: its inner nature is our will, its phenomenal appearance is
          our idea. For any one who could bring this unity of being to
          distinct consciousness, the difference between the continuance of
          the external world after his death and his own continuance after
          death would vanish. The two would present themselves to him as one
          and the same; nay, he would laugh at the delusion that could
          separate them. For the understanding of the indestructibility of
          our nature coincides with that of the identity of the macrocosm and
          the microcosm. Meanwhile one may obtain light upon what is said
          here by a peculiar experiment, performed by means of the
          imagination, an experiment which might be called metaphysical. Let
          any one try to present vividly to his mind the time, in any case
          not far distant, when he will be dead. Then he thinks himself away
          and lets the world go on existing; but soon, to his own
          astonishment, he will discover that he was nevertheless still
          there. For he intended to present the world to his mind without
          himself; but the ego is the immediate element in consciousness,
          through which alone the world is brought about, and for which alone
          it exists. This centre of all existence, this kernel of all
          reality, is to be abolished, and yet the world is to go on
          existing; it is a thought which can be conceived in the abstract,
          but not realised. The endeavour to accomplish this, the attempt to
          think the secondary without the primary, the conditioned without
          the condition, that which is supported without the supporter,
          always fails, much in the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page280">[pg
          280]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg280"></a>
          same way as the attempt to think an equilateral, right-angled
          triangle, or a destruction or origination of matter, and similar
          impossibilities. Instead of what was intended, the feeling here
          presses upon us that the world is not less in us than we in it, and
          that the source of all reality lies within us. The result is really
          this: the time when I shall not be will objectively come; but
          subjectively it can never come. It might therefore, indeed, be
          asked, how far every one, in his heart, actually believes in a
          thing which he really cannot conceive at all; or whether, since the
          profound consciousness of the indestructibleness of our true nature
          associates itself with that merely intellectual experiment, which,
          however, has already been made more or less distinctly by every
          one, whether, I say, our own death is not perhaps for us at bottom
          the most incredible thing in the world.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The deep
          conviction of the indestructibleness of our nature through death,
          which, as is also shown by the inevitable qualms of conscience at
          its approach, every one carries at the bottom of his heart, depends
          altogether upon the consciousness of the original and eternal
          nature of our being: therefore Spinoza expresses it thus:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Sentimus,
          experimurque, nos æternos esse</span></span>.”</span> For a
          reasonable man can only think of himself as imperishable, because
          he thinks of himself as without beginning, as eternal, in fact as
          timeless. Whoever, on the other hand, regards himself as having
          become out of nothing must also think that he will again become
          nothing; for that an eternity had passed before he was, and then a
          second eternity had begun, through which he will never cease to be,
          is a monstrous thought. Really the most solid ground for our
          immortality is the old principle: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Ex nihilo nihil fit, et in
          nihilum nihil potest reverti</span></span>.”</span> Theophrastus
          Paracelsus very happily says (Works, Strasburg, 1603, vol. ii. p.
          6): <span class="tei tei-q">“The soul in me has arisen out of
          something; therefore it does not come to nothing; for it comes out
          of something.”</span> He gives the true reason. But whoever
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page281">[pg 281]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg281"></a> regards the birth of
          the man as his absolute beginning must regard death as his absolute
          end. For both are what they are in the same sense; consequently
          every one can only think of himself as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">immortal</span></em> so far as he also thinks
          of himself as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unborn</span></em>, and in the same sense.
          What birth is, that also is death, according to its nature and
          significance: it is the same line drawn in two directions. If the
          former is an actual arising out of nothing, then the latter is also
          an actual annihilation. But in truth it is only by means of the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">eternity</span></em> of our real being that we
          can conceive it as imperishable, and consequently this
          imperishableness is not temporal. The assumption that man is made
          out of nothing leads necessarily to the assumption that death is
          his absolute end. Thus in this the Old Testament is perfectly
          consistent; for no doctrine of immortality is suitable to a
          creation out of nothing. New Testament Christianity has such a
          doctrine because it is Indian in spirit, and therefore more than
          probably also of Indian origin, although only indirectly, through
          Egypt. But to the Jewish stem, upon which that Indian wisdom had to
          be grafted in the Holy Land, such a doctrine is as little suited as
          the freedom of the will to its determinism, or as</p>

</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is always bad
          if one cannot be thoroughly original, and dare not carve out of the
          whole wood. Brahmanism and Buddhism, on the other hand, have quite
          consistently, besides the continued existence after death, an
          existence before birth to expiate the guilt of which we have this
          life. Moreover, how distinctly conscious they were of the necessary
          consistency in this is shown by the following passage from
          Colebrooke's <span class="tei tei-q">“History of the Indian
          Philosophy”</span> in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Transac. of the
          Asiatic London Society,”</span> vol. i. p. 577: <span class="tei tei-q">“Against the system of the Bhagavatas which is but
          partially heretical, the objection upon which <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page282">[pg 282]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg282"></a> the chief stress is laid by Vyaso is,
          that the soul would not be eternal if it were a production, and
          consequently had a beginning.”</span> Further, in Upham's
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Doctrine of Buddhism,”</span> p. 110, it
          is said: <span class="tei tei-q">“The lot in hell of impious
          persons called Deitty is the most severe: these are they who,
          discrediting the evidence of Buddha, adhere to the heretical
          doctrine that all living beings had their beginning in the mother's
          womb, and will have their end in death.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whoever
          conceives his existence as merely accidental must certainly fear
          that he will lose it by death. On the other hand, whoever sees,
          even only in general, that his existence rests upon some kind of
          original necessity will not believe that this which has produced so
          wonderful a thing is limited to such a brief span of time, but that
          it is active in every one. But he will recognise his existence as
          necessary who reflects that up till now, when he exists, already an
          infinite time, thus also an infinity of changes, has run its
          course, but in spite of this he yet exists; thus the Whole range of
          all possible states has already exhausted itself without being able
          to destroy his existence. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">If he could ever not be, he would already not
          be now.</span></em> For the infinity of the time that has already
          elapsed, with the exhausted possibility of the events in it,
          guarantees that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">what exists, exists necessarily</span></em>.
          Therefore every one must conceive himself as a necessary being,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, as a being whose existence
          would follow from its true and exhaustive definition if one only
          had it. In this line of thought, then, really lies the only
          immanent proof of the imperishableness of our nature, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          the only proof of this that holds good within the sphere of
          empirical data. In this nature existence must inhere, because it
          shows itself as independent of all states which can possibly be
          introduced through the chain of causes; for these states have
          already done what they could, and yet our existence has remained
          unshaken by it, as the ray of light by the storm wind which it cuts
          through. If time, of its own resources, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page283">[pg 283]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg283"></a> could bring us to a happy state, then we
          would already have been there long ago; for an infinite time lies
          behind us. But also: if it could lead us to destruction, we would
          already have long been no more. From the fact that we now exist, it
          follows, if well considered, that we must at all times exist. For
          we are ourselves the nature which time has taken up into itself in
          order to fill its void; consequently it fills the whole of time,
          present, past, and future, in the same way, and it is just as
          impossible for us to fall out of existence as to fall out of space.
          Carefully considered, it is inconceivable that what once exists in
          all the strength of reality should ever become nothing, and then
          not be, through an infinite time. Hence has arisen the Christian
          doctrine of the restoration of all things, that of the Hindus of
          the constantly repeated creation of the world by Brahma, together
          with similar dogmas of the Greek philosophers. The great mystery of
          our being and not being, to explain which these and all kindred
          dogmas have been devised, ultimately rests upon the fact that the
          same thing which objectively constitutes an infinite course of time
          is subjectively an indivisible, ever present present: but who
          comprehends it? It has been most distinctly set forth by Kant in
          his immortal doctrine of the ideality of time and the sole reality
          of the thing in itself. For it results from this that the really
          essential part of things, of man, of the world, lies permanently
          and enduringly in the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Nunc
          stans</span></span>, firm and immovable; and that the change of the
          phenomena and events is a mere consequence of our apprehension of
          them by means of our form of perception, which is time.
          Accordingly, instead of saying to men, <span class="tei tei-q">“Ye
          have arisen through birth, but are immortal,”</span> one ought to
          say to them, <span class="tei tei-q">“Ye are not nothing,”</span>
          and teach them to understand this in the sense of the saying
          attributed to Hermes Trismegistus, <span class="tei tei-q">“Το γαρ
          ὀν ἀει ἐσται”</span> (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Quod enim est, erit
          semper</span></span>), <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Stob. Ecl.</span></span>, i. 43, 6. If,
          however, this does not succeed, but the anxious heart raises its
          old <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page284">[pg 284]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg284"></a> lament, <span class="tei tei-q">“I see all beings arise through birth out of nothing,
          and after a brief term again return to this; my existence also, now
          in the present, will soon lie in the distant past, and I will be
          nothing!”</span>—the right answer is, <span class="tei tei-q">“Dost
          thou not exist? Hast thou not within thee the valuable present,
          after which ye children of time so eagerly strive, now within,
          actually within? And dost thou understand how thou hast attained to
          it? Knowest thou the paths which have led thee to it, that thou
          canst know they will be shut against thee by death? An existence of
          thyself after the destruction of thy body is not conceivable by
          thee as possible; but can it be more inconceivable to thee than thy
          present existence, and how thou hast attained to it? Why shouldst
          thou doubt but that the secret paths to this present, which stood
          open to thee, will also stand open to every future
          present?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If, then,
          considerations of this kind are at any rate adapted to awaken the
          conviction that there is something in us which death cannot
          destroy, this yet only takes place by raising us to a point of view
          from which birth is not the beginning of our existence. But from
          this it follows that what is proved to be indestructible by death
          is not properly the individual, which, moreover, as having arisen
          through generation, and having in itself the qualities of the
          father and mother, presents itself as a mere difference of the
          species, but as such can only be finite. As, in accordance with
          this, the individual has no recollection of its existence before
          its birth, so it can have no remembrance of its present existence
          after death. But every one places his ego in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">consciousness</span></em>; this seems to him
          therefore to be bound to individuality, with which, besides,
          everything disappears which is peculiar to him, as to this, and
          distinguishes him from others. His continued existence without
          individuality becomes to him therefore indistinguishable from the
          continuance of other beings, and he sees his ego sink. But whoever
          thus links his existence to the identity of consciousness, and
          therefore desires an endless <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page285">[pg 285]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg285"></a> existence after death for this, ought to
          reflect that he can certainly only attain this at the price of just
          as endless a past before birth. For since he has no remembrance of
          an existence before birth, thus his consciousness begins with
          birth, he must accept his birth as an origination of his existence
          out of nothing. But then he purchases the endless time of his
          existence after death for just as long a time before birth; thus
          the account balances without any profit for him. If, on the other
          hand, the existence which death leaves untouched is different from
          that of the individual consciousness, then it must be independent
          of birth, just as of death; and therefore, with regard to it, it
          must be equally true to say, <span class="tei tei-q">“I will always
          be,”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“I have always
          been;”</span> which then gives two infinities for one. But the
          great equivocation really lies in the word <span class="tei tei-q">“I,”</span> as any one will see at once who remembers
          the contents of our second book, and the separation which is made
          there of the willing from the knowing part of our nature. According
          as I understand this word I can say, <span class="tei tei-q">“Death
          is my complete end;”</span> or, <span class="tei tei-q">“This my
          personal phenomenal existence is just as infinitely small a part of
          my true nature as I am of the world.”</span> But the <span class="tei tei-q">“I”</span> is the dark point in consciousness, as on
          the retina the exact point at which the nerve of sight enters is
          blind, as the brain itself is entirely without sensation, the body
          of the sun is dark, and the eye sees all except itself. Our faculty
          of knowledge is directed entirely towards without, in accordance
          with the fact that it is the product of a brain function, which has
          arisen for the purpose of mere self-maintenance, thus of the search
          for nourishment and the capture of prey. Therefore every one knows
          himself only as this individual as it presents itself in external
          perception. If, on the other hand, he could bring to consciousness
          what he is besides and beyond this, then he would willingly give up
          his individuality, smile at the tenacity of his attachment to it,
          and say, <span class="tei tei-q">“What is the loss of this
          individuality to me, who bear in myself the possibility of
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page286">[pg 286]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg286"></a> innumerable
          individualities?”</span> He would see that even if a continued
          existence of his individuality does not lie before him, it is yet
          quite as good as if he had such an existence, because he carries in
          himself complete compensation for it. Besides, however, it may
          further be taken into consideration that the individuality of most
          men is so miserable and worthless that with it they truly lose
          nothing, and that that in them which may still have some worth is
          the universal human element; but to this imperishableness can be
          promised. Indeed, even the rigid unalterableness and essential
          limitation of every individual would, in the case of an endless
          duration of it, necessarily at last produce such great weariness by
          its monotony that only to be relieved of this one would prefer to
          become nothing. To desire that the individuality should be immortal
          really means to wish to perpetuate an error infinitely. For at
          bottom every individuality is really only a special error, a false
          step, something that had better not be; nay, something which it is
          the real end of life to bring us back from. This also finds
          confirmation in the fact that the great majority, indeed really all
          men, are so constituted that they could not be happy in whatever
          kind of world they might be placed. In proportion as such a world
          excluded want and hardship, they would become a prey to ennui, and
          in proportion as this was prevented, they would fall into want,
          misery, and suffering. Thus for a blessed condition of man it would
          be by no means sufficient that he should be transferred to a
          <span class="tei tei-q">“better world,”</span> but it would also be
          necessary that a complete change should take place in himself; that
          thus he should no longer be what he is, and, on the contrary,
          should become what he is not. But for this he must first of all
          cease to be what he is: this desideratum is, as a preliminary,
          supplied by death, the moral necessity of which can already be seen
          from this point of view. To be transferred to another world and to
          have his whole nature changed are, at bottom, one and the same.
          Upon this also ultimately rests that dependence <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page287">[pg 287]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg287"></a> of the objective upon the subjective
          which the idealism of our first book shows. Accordingly here lies
          the point at which the transcendent philosophy links itself on to
          ethics. If one considers this one will find that the awaking from
          the dream of life is only possible through the disappearance along
          with it of its whole ground-warp also, But this is its organ
          itself, the intellect together with its forms, with which the dream
          would spin itself out without end, so firmly is it incorporated
          with it. That which really dreamt this dream is yet different from
          it, and alone remains over. On the other hand, the fear that with
          death all will be over may be compared to the case of one who
          imagines in a dream that there are only dreams without a dreamer.
          But now, after an individual consciousness has once been ended by
          death, would it even be desirable that it should be kindled again
          in order to continue for ever? The greater part of its content,
          nay, generally its whole content, is nothing but a stream of small,
          earthly, paltry thoughts and endless cares. Let them, then, at last
          be stilled! Therefore with a true instinct, the ancients inscribed
          upon their gravestones: <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Securitati
          perpetuæ</span></span>;—or <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Bonæ
          quieti</span></span>. But if here, as so often has happened, a
          continued existence of the individual consciousness should be
          desired, in order to connect with it a future reward or punishment,
          what would really be aimed at in this would simply be the
          compatibility of virtue and egoism. But these two will never
          embrace: they are fundamentally opposed. On the other hand, the
          conviction is well founded, which the sight of noble conduct calls
          forth, that the spirit of love, which enjoins one man to spare his
          enemy, and another to protect at the risk of his life some one whom
          he has never seen before, can never pass away and become
          nothing.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The most
          thorough answer to the question as to the continued existence of
          the individual after death lies in Kant's great doctrine of the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ideality
          of time</span></em>, which just here shows itself specially
          fruitful and rich in consequences, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page288">[pg 288]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg288"></a> for it substitutes a purely theoretical but
          well-proved insight for dogmas which upon one path as upon the
          other lead to the absurd, and thus settles at once the most
          exciting of all metaphysical questions. Beginning, ending, and
          continuing are conceptions which derive their significance simply
          and solely from time, and are therefore valid only under the
          presupposition of this. But time has no absolute existence; it is
          not the manner of being of the thing in itself, but merely the form
          of our <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">knowledge</span></em> of our existence and
          nature, and that of all things, which is just on this account very
          imperfect, and is limited to mere phenomena. Thus with reference to
          this knowledge alone do the conceptions of ceasing and continuing
          find application, not with reference to that which exhibits itself
          in these, the inner being of things in relation to which these
          conceptions have therefore no longer any meaning. For this shows
          itself also in the fact that an answer to the question which arises
          from those time-conceptions is impossible, and every assertion of
          such an answer, whether upon one side or the other, is open to
          convincing objections. One might indeed assert that our true being
          continues after death because it is false that it is destroyed; but
          one might just as well assert that it is destroyed because it is
          false that it continues: at bottom the one is as true as the other.
          Accordingly something like an antinomy might certainly be set up
          here. But it would rest upon mere negations. In it one would deny
          two contradictorily opposite predicates of the subject of the
          judgment, but only because the whole category of these predicates
          would be inapplicable to that subject. But if now one denies these
          two predicates, not together, but separately, it appears as if the
          contradictory opposite of the predicate which in each case is
          denied were proved of the subject of the judgment. This, however,
          depends upon the fact that here incommensurable quantities are
          compared, for the problem removes us to a scene where time is
          abolished, and yet asks about temporal properties which it is
          consequently equally false to attribute <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page289">[pg 289]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg289"></a> to, or to deny of the subject. This just
          means: the problem is transcendent. In this sense death remains a
          mystery.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the other
          hand, adhering to that distinction between phenomenon and thing in
          itself, we can make the assertion that, as phenomenon, man is
          certainly perishable, but yet his true being will not be involved
          in this. Thus this true being is indestructible, although, on
          account of the elimination of time-conceptions which is connected
          with it, we cannot attribute to it continuance. Accordingly we
          would be led here to the conception of an indestructibility which
          would yet be no continuance. Now this is a conception which, having
          been obtained on the path of abstraction, can certainly also be
          thought in the abstract, but yet cannot be supported by any
          perception, and consequently cannot really become distinct; yet, on
          the other hand, we must here keep in mind that we have not, like
          Kant, absolutely given up the knowledge of the thing in itself, but
          know that it is to be sought for in the will. It is true that we
          have never asserted an absolute and exhaustive knowledge of the
          thing in itself, but rather have seen very well that it is
          impossible to know anything as it is absolutely and in itself. For
          as soon as I <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">know</span></em>, I have an idea; but this
          idea, just because it is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">my</span></em> idea, cannot be identical with
          what is known, but repeats it in an entirely different form, for it
          makes a being for other out of a being for self, and is thus always
          to be regarded as a phenomenal appearance of the thing in itself.
          Therefore for a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">knowing</span></em> consciousness, however it
          may be constituted, there can be always only phenomena. This is not
          entirely obviated even by the fact that it is my own nature which
          is known; for, since it falls within my <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">knowing</span></em>
          consciousness, it is already a reflex of my nature, something
          different from this itself, thus already in a certain degree
          phenomenon. So far, then, as I am a knowing being, I have even in
          my own nature really only a phenomenon; so far, on the other hand,
          as I am directly this nature <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page290">[pg 290]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg290"></a> itself, I am not a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">knowing</span></em>
          being. For it is sufficiently proved in the second book that
          knowledge is only a secondary property of our being, and introduced
          by its animal nature. Strictly speaking, then, we know even our own
          will always merely as phenomenon, and not as it may be absolutely
          in and for itself. But in that second book, and also in my work
          upon the will in nature, it is fully explained and proved that if,
          in order to penetrate into the inner nature of things, leaving what
          is given merely indirectly and from without, we stick to the only
          phenomenon into the nature of which an immediate insight from
          within is attainable, we find in this quite definitely, as the
          ultimate kernel of reality, the will, in which therefore we
          recognise the thing in itself in so far as it has here no longer
          space, although it still has time, for its form consequently really
          only in its most immediate manifestation, and with the reservation
          that this knowledge of it is still not exhaustive and entirely
          adequate. Thus in this sense we retain here also the conception of
          will as that of the thing in itself.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The conception
          of ceasing to be is certainly applicable to man as a phenomenon in
          time, and empirical knowledge plainly presents death as the end of
          this temporal existence. The end of the person is just as real as
          was its beginning, and in the same sense as before birth we were
          not, after death we shall be no more. Yet no more can be destroyed
          by death than was produced by birth; thus not that through which
          birth first became possible. In this sense <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">natus et denatus</span></span> is a beautiful
          expression. But now the whole of empirical knowledge affords us
          merely phenomena; therefore only phenomena are involved in the
          temporal processes of coming into being and passing away, and not
          that which manifests itself in the phenomena, the thing in itself.
          For this the opposition of coming into being and passing away
          conditioned by the brain, does not exist at all, but has here lost
          meaning and significance. It thus remains untouched by the
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page291">[pg 291]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg291"></a> temporal end of a
          temporal phenomenon, and constantly retains that existence to which
          the conceptions of beginning, end, and continuance are not
          applicable. But the thing in itself, so far as we can follow it, is
          in every phenomenal being the will of this being: so also in man.
          Consciousness, on the other hand, consists in knowledge. But
          knowledge, as activity of the brain, and consequently as function
          of the organism, belongs, as has been sufficiently proved, to the
          mere phenomenon, and therefore ends with this. The will alone,
          whose work, or rather whose image was the body, is that which is
          indestructible. The sharp distinction of will from knowledge,
          together with the primacy of the former, which constitutes the
          fundamental characteristic of my philosophy, is therefore the only
          key to the contradiction which presents itself in so many ways, and
          arises ever anew in every consciousness, even the most crude, that
          death is our end, and that yet we must be eternal and
          indestructible, thus the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">sentimus,
          experimurque nos æternos esse</span></span> of Spinoza. All
          philosophers have erred in this: they place the metaphysical, the
          indestructible, the eternal element in man in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intellect</span></em>. It lies exclusively in
          the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em>, which is entirely different
          from the intellect, and alone is original. The intellect, as was
          most fully shown in the second book, is a secondary phenomenon, and
          conditioned by the brain, therefore beginning and ending with this.
          The will alone is that which conditions, the kernel of the whole
          phenomenon, consequently free from the forms of the phenomenon to
          which time belongs, thus also indestructible. Accordingly with
          death consciousness is certainly lost, but not that which produced
          and sustained consciousness; life is extinguished, but not the
          principle of life also, which manifested itself in it. Therefore a
          sure feeling informs every one that there is something in him which
          is absolutely imperishable and indestructible. Indeed the freshness
          and vividness of memories of the most distant time, of earliest
          childhood, bears witness to the fact that <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page292">[pg 292]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg292"></a> something in us does not pass away with time,
          does not grow old, but endures unchanged. But what this
          imperishable element is one could not make clear to oneself. It is
          not consciousness any more than it is the body upon which clearly
          consciousness depends. But it is just that which, when it appears
          in consciousness, presents itself as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em>.
          Beyond this immediate manifestation of it we certainly cannot go;
          because we cannot go beyond consciousness; therefore the question
          what that may be when it does not come within consciousness,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, what it is absolutely in
          itself, remains unanswerable.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the
          phenomenon, and by means of its forms, time and space, as
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium individuationis</span></span>, what
          presents itself is that the human individual perishes, while the
          human race, on the contrary, always remains and lives. But in the
          true being of things, which is free from these forms, this whole
          distinction between the individual and the race also disappears,
          and the two are immediately one. The whole will to live is in the
          individual, as it is in the race, and therefore the continuance of
          the species is merely the image of the indestructibility of the
          individual.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Since, then, the
          infinitely important understanding of the indestructibility of our
          true nature by death depends entirely upon the distinction between
          phenomenon and thing in itself, I wish now to bring this difference
          into the clearest light by explaining it in the opposite of death,
          thus in the origin of the animal existence, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          generation. For this process, which is just as mysterious as death,
          presents to us most directly the fundamental opposition between the
          phenomenal appearance and the true being of things, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          between the world as idea and the world as will, and also the
          entire heterogeneity of the laws of these two. The act of
          procreation presents itself to us in a twofold manner: first, for
          self-consciousness, whose only object, as I have often shown, is
          the will, with all its affections; and then for the consciousness
          of other things, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page293">[pg
          293]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg293"></a>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the world of idea, or the
          empirical reality of things. Now, from the side of the will, thus
          inwardly, subjectively, for self-consciousness, that act presents
          itself as the most immediate and complete satisfaction of the will,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, as sensual pleasure. From
          the side of the idea, on the other hand, thus externally,
          objectively, for the consciousness of other things, this act is
          just the woof of the most cunning of webs, the foundation of the
          inexpressibly complicated animal organism, which then only requires
          to be developed to become visible to our astonished eyes. This
          organism, whose infinite complication and perfection is only known
          to him who has studied anatomy, cannot, from the side of the idea,
          be otherwise conceived and thought of than as a system devised with
          the most ingenious forethought and carried out with the most
          consummate skill and exactness, as the most arduous work of
          profound reflection. But from the side of the will we know, through
          self-consciousness, the production of this organism as the work of
          an act which is exactly the opposite of all reflection, an
          impetuous, blind impulse, an exceedingly pleasurable sensation.
          This opposition is closely related to the infinite contrast, which
          is shown above, between the absolute facility with which nature
          produces its works, together with the correspondingly boundless
          carelessness with which it abandons them to destruction, and the
          incalculably ingenious and studied construction of these very
          works, judging from which they must have been infinitely difficult
          to make, and their maintenance should have been provided for with
          all conceivable care; while we have the opposite before our eyes.
          If now by this certainly very unusual consideration, we have
          brought together in the boldest manner the two heterogeneous sides
          of the world, and, as it were, grasped them with one hand, we must
          now hold them fast in order to convince ourselves of the entire
          invalidity of the laws of the phenomenon, or the world as idea, for
          that of will, or the thing in itself. Then it will become more
          comprehensible to us <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page294">[pg
          294]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg294"></a>
          that while on the side of the idea, that is, in the phenomenal
          world, there exhibits itself to us now an arising out of nothing,
          and now an entire annihilation of what has arisen, from that other
          side, or in itself, a nature lies before us with reference to which
          the conceptions of arising and passing away have no significance.
          For, by going back to the root, where, by means of
          self-consciousness, the phenomenon and the thing in itself meet, we
          have just, as it were, palpably apprehended that the two are
          absolutely incommensurable, and the whole manner of being of the
          one, together with all the fundamental laws of its being, signify
          nothing, and less than nothing, in the other. I believe that this
          last consideration will only be rightly understood by a few, and
          that it will be displeasing and even offensive to all who do not
          understand it, but I shall never on this account omit anything that
          can serve to illustrate my fundamental thought.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the beginning
          of this chapter I have explained that the great clinging to life,
          or rather fear of death, by no means springs from knowledge, in
          which case it would be the result of the known value of life; but
          that that fear of death has its root directly in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em>,
          out of the original nature of which it proceeds, in which it is
          entirely without knowledge, and therefore blind will to live. As we
          are allured into life by the wholly illusory inclination to sensual
          pleasure, so we are retained in it by the fear of death, which is
          certainly just as illusory. Both spring directly from the will,
          which in itself is unconscious. If, on the contrary, man were
          merely a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">knowing</span></em> being, then death would
          necessarily be to him not only indifferent, but even welcome. The
          reflection to which we have here attained now teaches that what is
          affected by death is merely the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">knowing</span></em>
          consciousness, and the will, on the other hand, because it is the
          thing in itself, which lies at the foundation of every phenomenon,
          is free from all that depends upon temporal determinations, thus is
          also imperishable. Its striving towards existence and
          manifestation, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page295">[pg
          295]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg295"></a>
          from which the world results, is constantly satisfied, for this
          accompanies it as the shadow accompanies the body, for it is merely
          the visibility of its nature. That yet in us it fears death results
          from the fact that here knowledge presents its existence to it as
          merely in the individual phenomenon, whence the illusion arises
          that it will perish with this, as my image in a mirror seems to be
          destroyed along with it if the mirror is broken; this then, as
          contrary to its original nature, which is a blind striving towards
          existence, fills it with horror. From this now it follows that that
          in us which alone is capable of fearing death, and also alone fears
          it, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em>, is not affected by it; and
          that, on the other hand, what is affected by it and really perishes
          is that which from its nature is capable of no fear, and in general
          of no desire or emotion, and is therefore indifferent to being and
          not being, the mere subject of knowledge, the intellect, whose
          existence consists in its relation to the world of idea,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the objective world, whose
          correlative it is, and with whose existence its own is ultimately
          one. Thus, although the individual consciousness does not survive
          death, yet that survives it which alone struggles against it—the
          will. This also explains the contradiction that from the standpoint
          of knowledge philosophers have always proved with cogent reasons
          that death is no evil; yet the fear of death remains inevitable for
          all, because it is rooted, not in knowledge, but in the will. It is
          also a result of the fact that only the will, and not the
          intellect, is indestructible, that all religions and philosophies
          promise a reward in eternity only to the virtues of the will, or
          heart, not to those of the intellect, or head.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The following
          may also serve to illustrate this consideration. The will, which
          constitutes our true being, is of a simple nature; it merely wills,
          and does not know. The subject of knowledge, on the other hand, is
          a secondary phenomenon, arising from the objectification of the
          will; <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page296">[pg 296]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg296"></a> it is the point of
          unity of the sensibility of the nervous system, as it were the
          focus in which the rays of the activity of all the parts of the
          brain unite. With this, then, it must perish. In
          self-consciousness, as that which alone knows, it stands over
          against the will as its spectator, and, although sprung from it,
          knows it as something different from itself, something foreign to
          it, and consequently also only empirically, in time, by degrees, in
          its successive excitements and acts, and also learns its decisions
          only <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a posteriori</span></span>,
          and often very indirectly. This explains the fact that our own
          nature is a riddle to us, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, to our intellect, and that
          the individual regards itself as having newly arisen and as
          perishable; although its true nature is independent of time, thus
          is eternal. As now the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em> does not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">know</span></em>,
          so conversely the intellect, or the subject of knowledge, is simply
          and solely <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">knowing</span></em>, without ever <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">willing</span></em>. This can be proved even
          physically in the fact that, as was already mentioned in the second
          book, according to Bichat, the various emotions directly affect all
          parts of the organism and disturb their functions, with the
          exception of the brain, which can only be affected by them very
          indirectly, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, just in consequence of
          those disturbances (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De la vie et de la mort</span></span>, art. 6,
          § 2). But from this it follows that the subject of knowledge, for
          itself and as such, cannot take part or interest in anything, but
          for it the being or not being of everything, nay, even of its own
          self, is a matter of indifference. Now why should this purely
          neutral being be immortal? It ends with the temporal manifestation
          of the will, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the individual, as it
          arose with it. It is the lantern which is extinguished when it has
          served its end. The intellect, like the perceptible world which
          exists only in it, is a mere phenomenon; but the finiteness of both
          does not affect that of which they are the phenomenal appearance.
          The intellect is the function of the cerebral nervous system; but
          the latter, like the rest of the body, is the objectivity of the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em>. Therefore the intellect
          depends <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page297">[pg
          297]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg297"></a>
          upon the somatic life of the organism; but this itself depends upon
          the will. The organised body may thus, in a certain sense, be
          regarded as the link between the will and the intellect; although
          really it is only the will itself exhibiting itself spatially in
          the perception of the intellect. Death and birth are the constant
          renewal of the consciousness of the will, in itself without end and
          without beginning, which alone is, as it were, the substance of
          existence (but each such renewal brings a new possibility of the
          denial of the will to live). Consciousness is the life of the
          subject of knowledge, or the brain, and death is its end. And
          therefore, finally, consciousness is always new, in each case
          beginning at the beginning. The will alone is permanent; and,
          moreover, it is it alone that permanence concerns; for it is the
          will to live. The knowing subject for itself is not concerned about
          anything. In the ego, however, the two are bound up together. In
          every animal existence the will has achieved an intellect which is
          the light by which it here pursues its ends. It may be remarked by
          the way that the fear of death may also partly depend upon the fact
          that the individual will is so loath to separate from the intellect
          which has fallen to its lot through the course of nature, its guide
          and guard, without which it knows that it is helpless and
          blind.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Finally, this
          explanation also agrees with the commonplace moral experience which
          teaches us that the will alone is real, while its objects, on the
          other hand, as conditioned by knowledge, are only phenomena, are
          only froth and vapour, like the wine which Mephistopheles provided
          in Auerbach's cellar: after every sensuous pleasure we also say,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“And yet it seemed as I were drinking
          wine.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The terrors of
          death depend for the most part upon the false illusion that now the
          ego vanishes and the world remains. But rather is the opposite the
          case; the world vanishes, but the inmost kernel of the ego, the
          supporter <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page298">[pg
          298]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg298"></a>
          and producer of that subject, in whose idea alone the world has its
          existence, remains. With the brain the intellect perishes, and with
          the intellect the objective world, its mere idea. That in other
          brains, afterwards as before, a similar world lives and moves is,
          with reference to the intellect which perishes, a matter of
          indifference. If, therefore, reality proper did not lie in the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em>, and if the moral existence
          were not that which extends beyond death, then, since the
          intellect, and with it its world, is extinguished, the true nature
          of things in general would be no more than an endless succession of
          short and troubled dreams, without connection among themselves; for
          the permanence of unconscious nature consists merely in the idea of
          time of conscious nature. Thus a world-spirit dreaming without end
          or aim, dreams which for the most part are very troubled and heavy,
          would then be all in all.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When, now, an
          individual experiences the fear of death, we have really before us
          the extraordinary, nay, absurd, spectacle of the lord of the
          worlds, who fills all with his being, and through whom alone
          everything that is has its existence, desponding and afraid of
          perishing, of sinking into the abyss of eternal nothingness;—while,
          in truth, all is full of him, and there is no place where he is
          not, no being in which he does not live; for it is not existence
          that supports him, but he that supports existence. Yet it is he who
          desponds in the individual who suffers from the fear of death, for
          he is exposed to the illusion produced by the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium individuationis</span></span> that
          his existence is limited to the nature which is now dying. This
          illusion belongs to the heavy dream into which, as the will to
          live, he has fallen. But one might say to the dying individual:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou ceasest to be something which thou
          hadst done better never to become.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So long as no
          denial of the will takes place, what death leaves untouched is the
          germ and kernel of quite another existence, in which a new
          individual finds itself again, so <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page299">[pg 299]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg299"></a> fresh and original that it broods over itself
          in astonishment. What sleep is for the individual, death is for the
          will as thing in itself. It would not endure to continue the same
          actions and sufferings throughout an eternity without true gain, if
          memory and individuality remained to it. It flings them off, and
          this is lethe; and through this sleep of death it reappears
          refreshed and fitted out with another intellect, as a new
          being—<span class="tei tei-q">“a new day tempts to new
          shores.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As the
          self-asserting will to live man has the root of his existence in
          the species. Accordingly death is the loss of one individuality and
          the assumption of another, consequently a change of individuality
          under the exclusive guidance of one's own will. For in this alone
          lies the eternal power which could produce its existence with its
          ego, yet, on account of its nature, was not able to maintain it in
          existence. For death is the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">démenti</span></span> which the essence
          (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">essentia</span></span>) of every one receives
          in its claim to existence (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">existentia</span></span>), the appearance of a
          contradiction which lies in every individual existence:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But an infinite
          number of such existences, each with its ego, stands within reach
          of this power, thus of the will, which, however, will again prove
          just as transitory and perishable. Since now every ego has its
          separate consciousness, that infinite number of them is, with
          reference to such an ego, not different from a single one. From
          this point of view it appears to me not accidental that <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ævum</span></span>, αἰων, signifies both the
          individual term of life and infinite time. Indeed from this point
          of view it may be seen, although indistinctly, that ultimately and
          in themselves both are the same; and according to this there would
          really be no difference whether I existed only through my term of
          life or for an infinite time.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Certainly,
          however, we cannot obtain an idea of all that <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page300">[pg 300]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg300"></a> is said above entirely without
          time-concepts; yet when we are dealing with the thing in itself
          these ought to be excluded. But it belongs to the unalterable
          limitations of our intellect that it can never entirely cast off
          this first and most immediate form of all its ideas, in order to
          operate without it. Therefore we certainly come here upon a kind of
          metempsychosis, although with the important difference that it does
          not concern the whole ψυχη, not the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">knowing</span></em>
          being, but the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em> alone; and thus, with the
          consciousness that the form of time only enters here as an
          unavoidable concession to the limitation of our intellect, so many
          absurdities which accompany the doctrine of metempsychosis
          disappear. If, indeed, we now call in the assistance of the fact,
          to be explained in chapter 43, that the character, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          the will, is inherited from the father, and the intellect, on the
          other hand, from the mother, it agrees very well with our view that
          the will of a man, in itself individual, separated itself in death
          from the intellect received from the mother in generation, and in
          accordance with its now modified nature, under the guidance of the
          absolutely necessary course of the world harmonising with this,
          received through a new generation a new intellect, with which it
          became a new being, which had no recollection of an earlier
          existence; for the intellect, which alone has the faculty of
          memory, is the mortal part or the form, while the will is the
          eternal part, the substance. In accordance with this, this doctrine
          is more correctly denoted by the word palingenesis than by
          metempsychosis. These constant new births, then, constitute the
          succession of the life-dreams of a will which in itself is
          indestructible, until, instructed and improved by so much and such
          various successive knowledge in a constantly new form, it abolishes
          or abrogates itself.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The true and, so
          to speak, esoteric doctrine of Buddhism, as we have come to know it
          through the latest investigations, also agrees with this view, for
          it teaches not metempsychosis, but a peculiar palingenesis, resting
          upon a moral <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page301">[pg
          301]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg301"></a>
          basis which it works out and explains with great profundity. This
          may be seen from the exposition of the subject, well worth reading
          and pondering, which is given in Spence Hardy's <span class="tei tei-q">“Manual of Buddhism,”</span> pp. 394-96 (with which
          compare pp. 429, 440, and 445 of the same book), the confirmation
          of which is to be found in Taylor's <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Prabodh Chandro Daya</span></span>,”</span>
          London, 1812, p. 35; also in Sangermano's <span class="tei tei-q">“Burmese Empire,”</span> p. 6, and in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Asiatic Researches,”</span> vol. vi. p. 179, and vol.
          ix. p. 256. The very useful German compendium of Buddhism by Köppen
          is also right upon this point. Yet for the great mass of Buddhists
          this doctrine is too subtle; therefore to them simple
          metempsychosis is preached as a comprehensible substitute.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Besides, it must
          not be neglected that even empirical grounds support a palingenesis
          of this kind. As a matter of fact there does exist a connection
          between the birth of the newly appearing beings and the death of
          those that are worn out. It shows itself in the great fruitfulness
          of the human race which appears as a consequence of devastating
          diseases. When in the fourteenth century the black death had for
          the most part depopulated the old world, a quite abnormal
          fruitfulness appeared among the human race, and twin-births were
          very frequent. The circumstance was also very remarkable that none
          of the children born at this time obtained their full number of
          teeth; thus nature, exerting itself to the utmost, was niggardly in
          details. This is related by F. Schnurrer, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Chronik der Seuchen</span></span>,”</span>
          1825. Casper also, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ueber die
          wahrscheinliche Lebensdauer des Menschen</span></span>,”</span>
          1835, confirms the principle that the number of births in a given
          population has the most decided influence upon the length of life
          and mortality in it, as this always keeps pace with the mortality:
          so that always and everywhere the deaths and the births increase
          and decrease in like proportion; which he places beyond doubt by an
          accumulation of evidence collected from many lands and their
          various <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page302">[pg
          302]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg302"></a>
          provinces. And yet it is impossible that there can be a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">physical</span></em> causal connection between
          my early death and the fruitfulness of a marriage with which I have
          nothing to do, or conversely. Thus here the metaphysical appears
          undeniably and in a stupendous manner as the immediate ground of
          explanation of the physical. Every new-born being indeed comes
          fresh and blithe into the new existence, and enjoys it as a free
          gift: but there is, and can be, nothing freely given. Its fresh
          existence is paid for by the old age and death of a worn-out
          existence which has perished, but which contained the
          indestructible seed out of which this new existence has arisen:
          they are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> being. To show the bridge
          between the two would certainly be the solution of a great
          riddle.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The great truth
          which is expressed here has never been entirely unacknowledged,
          although it could not be reduced to its exact and correct meaning,
          which is only possible through the doctrine of the primacy and
          metaphysical nature of the will and the secondary, merely organic
          nature of the intellect. We find the doctrine of metempsychosis,
          springing from the earliest and noblest ages of the human race,
          always spread abroad in the earth as the belief of the great
          majority of mankind, nay, really as the teaching of all religions,
          with the exception of that of the Jews and the two which have
          proceeded from it: in the most subtle form, however, and coming
          nearest to the truth, as has already been mentioned, in Buddhism.
          Accordingly, while Christians console themselves with the thought
          of meeting again in another world, in which one regains one's
          complete personality and knows oneself at once, in those other
          religions the meeting again is already going on now, only
          incognito. In the succession of births, and by virtue of
          metempsychosis or palingenesis, the persons who now stand in close
          connection or contact with us will also be born along with us at
          the next birth, and will have the same or analogous relations and
          sentiments towards us as now, whether these are of a friendly or a
          hostile description. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page303">[pg
          303]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg303"></a>
          (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cf.</span></span>, for example, Spence Hardy's
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Manual of Buddhism,”</span> p. 162.)
          Recognition is certainly here limited to an obscure intimation, a
          reminiscence which cannot be brought to distinct consciousness, and
          refers to an infinitely distant time;—with the exception, however,
          of Buddha himself, who has the prerogative of distinctly knowing
          his own earlier births and those of others;—as this is described in
          the <span class="tei tei-q">“Jâtaka.”</span> But, in fact, if at
          favourable moment one contemplates, in a purely objective manner,
          the action of men in reality; the intuitive conviction is forced
          upon one that it not only is and remains constantly the same,
          according to the (Platonic) Idea, but also that the present
          generation, in its true inner nature, is precisely and
          substantially identical with every generation that has been before
          it. The question simply is in what this true being consists. The
          answer which my doctrine gives to this question is well known. The
          intuitive conviction referred to may be conceived as arising from
          the fact that the multiplying-glasses, time and space, lose for a
          moment their effect. With reference to the universality of the
          belief in metempsychosis, Obry says rightly, in his excellent book,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Du Nirvana Indien</span></span>,”</span> p.
          13: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">Cette vieille croyance a fait le tour du
          monde, et était tellement répandue dans la haute antiquité, qu'un
          docte Anglican l'avait jugée sans père, sans mère, et sans
          généalogie</span></span>”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ths. Burnet, dans
          Beausobre, Hist. du Manichéisme</span></span>, ii. p. 391). Taught
          already in the "Vedas," as in all the sacred books of India,
          metempsychosis is well known to be the kernel of Brahmanism and
          Buddhism. It accordingly prevails at the present day in the whole
          of non-Mohammedan Asia, thus among more than half of the whole
          human race, as the firmest conviction, and with an incredibly
          strong practical influence. It was also the belief of the Egyptians
          (Herod., ii. 123), from whom it was received with enthusiasm by
          Orpheus. Pythagoras, and Plato: the Pythagoreans, however,
          specially retained it. That it was also taught in the mysteries
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page304">[pg 304]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg304"></a> of the Greeks
          undeniably follows from the ninth book of Plato's <span class="tei tei-q">“Laws”</span> (pp. 38 and 42, ed. Bip.) Nemesius indeed
          (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De nat.
          hom.</span></span>, c. 2) says: <span class="tei tei-q">“Κοινη μεν
          οὐν παντες Ἑλληνες, οἱ την ψυχην αθανατον αποφηναμενοι, την
          μετενσωματωσιν δογματιζουσι.”</span> (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Communiter igitur omnes Græci, qui animam
          immortalem statuerunt, eam de uno corpore in aliud transferri
          censuerunt.</span></span>) The <span class="tei tei-q">“Edda”</span> also, especially in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Völuspá,”</span> teaches metempsychosis. Not less was
          it the foundation of the religion of the Druids (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cæs. de bello
          Gall.</span></span>, vi.; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">A. Pictet, Le mystère des Bardes de l'ile de
          Bretagne</span></span>, 1856). Even a Mohammedan sect in Hindostan,
          the Bohrahs, of which Colebrooke gives a full account in the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Asiatic Researches,”</span> vol. vii. p.
          336 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sqq.</span></span>, believes in
          metempsychosis, and accordingly refrains from all animal food. Also
          among American Indians and negro tribes, nay, even among the
          natives of Australia, traces of this belief are found, as appears
          from a minute description given in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Times</span></span>
          of 29th January 1841 of the execution of two Australian savages for
          arson and murder. It is said there: <span class="tei tei-q">“The
          younger of the two prisoners met his end with a dogged and a
          determined spirit, as it appeared, of revenge; the only
          intelligible expressions made use of conveyed an impression that he
          would rise up a <span class="tei tei-q">‘white fellow,’</span>
          which it was considered strengthened his resolution.”</span> Also
          in a book by Ungewitter, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Der Welttheil
          Australien</span></span>,”</span> it is related that the Papuas in
          Australia regarded the whites as their own relations who had
          returned to the world. According to all this, the belief in
          metempsychosis presents itself as the natural conviction of man,
          whenever he reflects at all in an unprejudiced manner. It would
          really be that which Kant falsely asserts of his three pretended
          Ideas of the reason, a philosopheme natural to human reason, which
          proceeds from its forms; and when it is not found it must have been
          displaced by positive religious doctrines coming from a different
          source. I have also remarked that it is at once obvious to every
          one who hears of it for the first time. Let any one only
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page305">[pg 305]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg305"></a> observe how
          earnestly Lessing defends it in the last seven paragraphs of his
          <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Erziehung des
          Menschengeschlechts</span></span>.”</span> Lichtenberg also says in
          his <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Selbstcharacteristik</span></span>:”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“I cannot get rid of the thought that I
          died before I was born.”</span> Even the excessively empirical Hume
          says in his sceptical essay on immortality, p. 23: <span class="tei tei-q">“The metempsychosis is therefore the only system of
          this kind that philosophy can hearken to.”</span><a href="#note_31" id="noteref_31" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">31</span></span></a> What
          resists this belief, which is spread over the whole human race and
          commends itself alike to the wise and to the vulgar, is Judaism,
          together with the two religions which have sprung from it, because
          they teach the creation of man out of nothing, and he has then the
          hard task of linking on to this the belief in an endless existence
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a parte post</span></span>. They certainly
          have succeeded, with fire and sword, in driving out of Europe and
          part of Asia that consoling primitive belief of mankind; it is
          still doubtful for how long. Yet how difficult this was is shown by
          the oldest Church histories. Most of the heretics were attached to
          this primitive belief; for example, Simonists, Basilidians,
          Valentinians, Marcionists, Gnostics, and Manichæans. The Jews
          themselves have in part fallen into it, as Tertullian and Justinus
          (in his dialogues) inform us. In the Talmud it is related that
          Abel's soul passed into the body of Seth, and then into that of
          Moses. Even the passage of the Bible, Matt. xvi. 13-15, only
          obtains a rational meaning if we understand it as spoken under the
          assumption of the dogma of metempsychosis. Luke, it is true, who
          also has the passage (ix. 18-20), adds the words ὁτι προφητης τις
          των αρχαιων ανεστῃ, and thus attributes to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page306">[pg 306]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg306"></a> the Jews the assumption that such an ancient
          prophet can rise again body and all, which, since they know that he
          has already lain between six and seven hundred years in his grave,
          and consequently has long since turned to dust, would be a palpable
          absurdity. In Christianity, however, the doctrine of original sin,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the doctrine of punishment
          for the sins of another individual, has taken the place of the
          transmigration of souls and the expiation in this way of all the
          sins committed in an earlier life. Both identify, and that with a
          moral tendency, the existing man with one who has existed before;
          the transmigration of souls does so directly, original sin
          indirectly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Death is the
          great reprimand which the will to live, or more especially the
          egoism, which is essential to this, receives through the course of
          nature; and it may be conceived as a punishment for our
          existence.<a href="#note_32" id="noteref_32" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">32</span></span></a> It is
          the painful loosing of the knot which the act of generation had
          tied with sensual pleasure, the violent destruction coming from
          without of the fundamental error of our nature: the great
          disillusion. We are at bottom something that ought not to be:
          therefore we cease to be. Egoism consists really in the fact that
          man limits all reality to his own person, in that he imagines that
          he lives in this alone and not in others. Death teaches him better,
          for it destroys this person, so that the true nature of man, which
          is his will, will henceforth live only in other individuals; while
          his intellect, which itself belonged only to the phenomenon,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, to the world as idea, and
          was merely the form of the external world, also continues to exist
          in the condition of being idea, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">objective</span></em> being of things as such,
          thus also only in the existence of what was hitherto the external
          world. His whole ego thus lives from this time forth only in that
          which he had hitherto regarded as non-ego: for the difference
          between external and internal ceases. We call to mind <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page307">[pg 307]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg307"></a> here that the better man is he who
          makes the least difference between himself and others, does not
          regard them as absolute non-ego, while for the bad man this
          difference is great, nay, absolute. I have worked this out in my
          prize essay on the foundation of morals. According to what was said
          above, the degree in which death can be regarded as the
          annihilation of the man is in proportion to this difference. But if
          we start from the fact that the distinction of outside me and in
          me, as a spatial distinction, is only founded in the phenomenon,
          not in the thing in itself, thus is no absolutely real distinction,
          then we shall see in the losing of our own individuality only the
          loss of a phenomenon, thus only an apparent loss. However much
          reality that distinction has in the empirical consciousness, yet
          from the metaphysical standpoint the propositions, <span class="tei tei-q">“I perish, but the world endures,”</span> and
          <span class="tei tei-q">“The world perishes but I endure,”</span>
          are at bottom not really different.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But, besides all
          this, death is the great opportunity no longer to be I;—to him who
          uses it. During life the will of man is without freedom: his action
          takes place with necessity upon the basis of his unalterable
          character in the chain of motives. But every one remembers much
          that he has done, and on account of which he is by no means
          satisfied with himself. If now he were to go on living, he would go
          on acting in the same way, on account of the unalterable nature of
          his character. Accordingly he must cease to be what he is in order
          to be able to arise out of the germ of his nature as a new and
          different being. Therefore death looses these bonds; the will again
          becomes free; for freedom lies in the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Esse</span></span>, not in the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Operari</span></span>. <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Finditur nodus cordis,
          dissolvuntur omnes dubitationes, ejusque opera
          evanescunt</span></span>,”</span> is a very celebrated saying of
          the Vedas, which all Vedantic writers frequently repeat.<a href="#note_33" id="noteref_33" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">33</span></span></a> Death
          is the moment of that deliverance from the one-sidedness
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page308">[pg 308]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg308"></a> of an individuality
          which does not constitute the inmost kernel of our being, but is
          rather to be thought of as a kind of aberration of it. The true
          original freedom re-enters at this moment, which, in the sense
          indicated, may be regarded as a <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">restitutio in integrum</span></span>. The
          peace and quietness upon the countenance of most dead persons seems
          to have its origin in this. Quiet and easy is, as a rule, the death
          of every good man: but to die willingly, to die gladly, to die
          joyfully, is the prerogative of the resigned, of him who surrenders
          and denies the will to live. For only he wills to die <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">really</span></em>,
          and not merely <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">apparently</span></em>, and consequently he
          needs and desires no continuance of his person. The existence which
          we know he willingly gives up: what he gets instead of it is in our
          eyes <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nothing</span></em>, because our existence is,
          with reference to that, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nothing</span></em>. The Buddhist faith calls
          it Nirvana,<a href="#note_34" id="noteref_34" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">34</span></span></a>

<span style="font-size: 144%">Chapter XLII. The Life Of The
          Species.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the preceding
          chapter it was called to mind that the (Platonic) Ideas of the
          different grades of beings, which are the adequate objectification
          of the will to live, exhibit themselves in the knowledge of the
          individual, which is bound to the form of time, as the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">species</span></em>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          as the successive individuals of one kind connected by the bond of
          generation, and that therefore the species is the Idea (εἰδος,
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">species</span></em>) broken up in time.
          Accordingly the true nature of every living thing lies primarily in
          its species: yet the species again has its existence only in the
          individuals. Now, although the will only attains to
          self-consciousness in the individual, thus knows itself immediately
          only as the individual, yet the deep-seated consciousness that it
          is really the species in which his true nature objectifies itself
          appears in the fact that for the individual the concerns of the
          species as such, thus the relations of the sexes, the production
          and nourishment of the offspring, are of incomparably greater
          importance and consequence than everything else. Hence, then,
          arises in the case of the brutes, heat or rut (an excellent
          description of the vehemence of which will be found in Burdach's
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Physiology,”</span> vol. i. §§ 247, 257),
          and, in the case of man, the careful and capricious selection of
          the other individual for the satisfaction of the sexual impulse,
          which can rise to the height of passionate love, to the fuller
          investigation of which I shall devote a special chapter: hence
          also, finally the excessive love of parents for their
          offspring.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page310">[pg
          310]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg310"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the
          supplements to the second book the will was compared to the root
          and the intellect to the crown of the tree; and this is the case
          inwardly or psychologically. But outwardly or physiologically the
          genitals are the root and the head the crown. The nourishing part
          is certainly not the genitals, but the villi of the intestines: yet
          not the latter but the former are the root; because through them
          the individual is connected with the species in which it is rooted.
          For physically the individual is a production of the species,
          metaphysically a more or less perfect picture of the Idea, which,
          in the form of time, exhibits itself as species. In agreement with
          the relation expressed here, the greatest vitality, and also the
          decrepitude of the brain and the genital organs, is simultaneous
          and stands in connection. The sexual impulse is to be regarded as
          the inner life of the tree (the species) upon which the life of the
          individual grows, like a leaf that is nourished by the tree, and
          assists in nourishing the tree; this is why that impulse is so
          strong, and springs from the depths of our nature. To castrate an
          individual means to cut him off from the tree of the species upon
          which he grows, and thus severed, leave him to wither: hence the
          degradation of his mental and physical powers. That the service of
          the species, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, fecundation, is followed
          in the case of every animal individual by momentary exhaustion and
          debility of all the powers, and in the case of most insects indeed
          by speedy death, on account of which Celsus said, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Seminis emissio est partis
          animæ jactura</span></span>;”</span> that in the case of man the
          extinction of the generative power shows that the individual
          approaches death; that excessive use of this power at every age
          shortens life, while, on the other hand, temperance in this respect
          increases all the powers, and especially the muscular powers, on
          which account it was part of the training of the Greek athletes;
          that the same restraint lengthens the life of the insect even to
          the following spring; all this points to the fact that the life of
          the individual is <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page311">[pg
          311]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg311"></a>
          at bottom only borrowed from the species, and that all vital force
          is, as it were, force of the species restricted by being dammed up.
          But this is to be explained from the fact that the metaphysical
          substratum of life reveals itself directly in the species and only
          by means of this in the individual. Accordingly the Lingam with the
          Yoni, as the symbol of the species and its immortality, is
          worshipped in India, and, as the counterpoise of death, is ascribed
          as an attribute to the very divinity who presides over death,
          Siva.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But without myth
          or symbol, the vehemence of the sexual impulse, the keen intentness
          and profound seriousness with which every animal, including man,
          pursues its concerns, shows that it is through the function which
          serves it that the animal belongs to that in which really and
          principally its true being lies, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">species</span></em>; while all other functions
          and organs directly serve only the individual, whose existence is
          at bottom merely secondary. In the vehemence of that impulse, which
          is the concentration of the whole animal nature, the consciousness
          further expresses itself that the individual does not endure, and
          therefore all must be staked on the maintenance of the species, in
          which its true existence lies.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To illustrate
          what has been said, let us now imagine a brute in rut, and in the
          act of generation. We see a seriousness and intentness never known
          in it at any other time. Now what goes on in it? Does it know that
          it must die, and that through its present occupation a new
          individual, which yet entirely resembles itself, will arise in
          order to take its place? Of all this it knows nothing, for it does
          not think. But it is as intently careful for the continuance of the
          species in time as if it knew all that. For it is conscious that it
          desires to live and exist, and it expresses the highest degree of
          this volition in the act of generation; this is all that then takes
          place in its consciousness. This is also quite sufficient for the
          permanence of the kind; just because the will is the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page312">[pg 312]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg312"></a> radical and knowledge the adventitious.
          On this account the will does not require to be guided by knowledge
          throughout; but whenever in its primitive originality it has
          resolved, this volition will objectify itself of its own accord in
          the world of the idea. If now in this way it is that definite
          animal form which we have thought of that wills life and existence,
          it does not will life and existence in general, but in this
          particular form. Therefore it is the sight of its form in the
          female of its species that stimulates the will of the brute to the
          act of generation. This volition of the brute, when regarded from
          without and under the form of time, presents itself as such an
          animal form maintained through an infinite time by the constantly
          repeated replacement of one individual by another, thus by the
          alternation of death and reproduction, which so regarded appear
          only as the pulse-beats of that form (ιδεα, εἰδος, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">species</span></em>) which endures through all
          time. They may be compared to the forces of attraction and
          repulsion in which matter consists. That which is shown here in the
          brute holds good also of man; for although in him the act of
          generation is accompanied by complete knowledge of its final cause,
          yet it is not guided by this knowledge, but proceeds directly from
          the will to live as its concentration. It is accordingly to be
          reckoned among instinctive actions. For in reproduction the brute
          is just as little guided by knowledge of the end as in mechanical
          instincts; in these also the will manifests itself, in the main,
          without the mediation of knowledge, which here, as there, is only
          concerned with details. Reproduction is, to a certain extent, the
          most marvellous of all instincts, and its work the most
          astonishing.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These
          considerations explain why the sexual desire has a very different
          character from every other; it is not only the strongest, but even
          specifically of a more powerful kind than any other. It is
          everywhere tacitly assumed as necessary and inevitable, and is not,
          like other desires, a matter of taste and disposition. For it is
          the desire which <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page313">[pg
          313]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg313"></a>
          even constitutes the nature of man. In conflict with it no motive
          is so strong that it would be certain of victory. It is so
          pre-eminently the chief concern that no other pleasures make up for
          the deprivation of its satisfaction; and, moreover, for its sake
          both brute and man undertake every danger and every conflict. A
          very naïve expression of this disposition is the well-known
          inscription on the door of the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">fornix</span></span> at Pompeii, decorated
          with the phallus: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Heic habitat felicitas</span></span>:”</span>
          this was for those going in naïve, for those coming out ironical,
          and in itself humorous. On the other hand, the excessive power of
          the sexual passion is seriously and worthily expressed in the
          inscription which (according to Theon of Smyrna, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De
          Musica</span></span>, c. 47), Osiris had placed upon the column he
          erected to the eternal gods: <span class="tei tei-q">“To Eros, the
          spirit, the heaven, the sun, the moon, the earth, the night, the
          day, and the father of all that is and that shall be;”</span> also

          which the relation of the sexes plays in the world of men, where it
          is really the invisible central point of all action and conduct,
          and peeps out everywhere in spite of all veils thrown over it. It
          is the cause of war and the end of peace, the basis of what is
          serious, and the aim of the jest, the inexhaustible source of wit,
          the key to all allusions, and the meaning of all mysterious hints,
          of all unspoken offers and all stolen glances, the daily meditation
          of the young, and often also of the old, the hourly thought of the
          unchaste, and even against their will the constantly recurring
          imagination of the chaste, the ever ready material of a joke, just
          because the profoundest seriousness lies at its foundation. It is,
          however, the piquant element and the joke of life that the chief
          concern of all men is secretly pursued and ostensibly ignored
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page314">[pg 314]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg314"></a> as much as possible.
          But, in fact, we see it every moment seat itself, as the true and
          hereditary lord of the world, out of the fulness of its own
          strength, upon the ancestral throne, and looking down from thence
          with scornful glances, laugh at the preparations which have been
          made to bind it, imprison it, or at least to limit it and wherever
          it is possible to keep it concealed, or even so to master it that
          it shall only appear as a subordinate, secondary concern of life.
          But all this agrees with the fact that the sexual passion is the
          kernel of the will to live, and consequently the concentration of
          all desire; therefore in the text I have called the genital organs
          the focus of the will. Indeed, one may say man is concrete sexual
          desire; for his origin is an act of copulation and his wish of
          wishes is an act of copulation, and this tendency alone perpetuates
          and holds together his whole phenomenal existence. The will to live
          manifests itself indeed primarily as an effort to sustain the
          individual; yet this is only a step to the effort to sustain the
          species, and the latter endeavour must be more powerful in
          proportion as the life of the species surpasses that of the
          individual in duration, extension, and value. Therefore sexual
          passion is the most perfect manifestation of the will to live, its
          most distinctly expressed type; and the origin of the individual in
          it, and its primacy over all other desires of the natural man, are
          both in complete agreement with this.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One other remark
          of a physiological nature is in place here, a remark which throws
          light upon my fundamental doctrine expounded in the second book. As
          the sexual impulse is the most vehement of desires, the wish of
          wishes, the concentration of all our volition, and accordingly the
          satisfaction of it which exactly corresponds to the individual wish
          of any one, that is, the desire fixed upon a definite individual,
          is the summit and crown of his happiness, the ultimate goal of his
          natural endeavours, with the attainment of which everything seems
          to him to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page315">[pg
          315]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg315"></a>
          have been attained, and with the frustrating of which everything
          seems to him to have been lost:—so we find, as its physiological
          correlative, in the objectified will, thus in the human organism,
          the sperm or semen as the secretion of secretions, the quintessence
          of all animal fluids, the last result of all organic functions, and
          have in it a new proof of the fact that the body is only the
          objectivity of the will, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, is the will itself under
          the form of the idea.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With
          reproduction is connected the maintenance of the offspring, and
          with the sexual impulse, parental love; and thus through these the
          life of the species is carried on. Accordingly the love of the
          brute for its young has, like the sexual impulse, a strength which
          far surpasses that of the efforts which merely concerns itself as
          an individual. This shows itself in the fact that even the mildest
          animals are ready to undertake for the sake of their young even the
          most unequal battle for life and death, and with almost all species
          of animals the mother encounters any danger for the protection of
          her young, nay, in many cases even faces certain death. In the case
          of man this instinctive parental love is guided and directed by
          reason, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, by reflection. Sometimes,
          however, it is also in this way restricted, and with bad characters
          this may extend to the complete repudiation of it. Therefore we can
          observe its effects most purely in the lower animals. In itself,
          however, it is not less strong in man; here also, in particular
          cases, we see it entirely overcome self-love, and even extend to
          the sacrifice of life. Thus, for example, the French newspapers
          have just announced that at Cahors, in the department of Lot, a
          father has taken his own life in order that his son, who had been
          drawn for military service, should be the eldest son of a widow,
          and therefore exempt (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Galignani's Messenger</span></span> of 22d
          June 1843). Yet in the case of the lower animals, since they are
          capable of no reflection, the instinctive maternal affection (the
          male is generally ignorant <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page316">[pg 316]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg316"></a> of his paternity) shows itself directly and
          unsophisticated, and therefore with perfect distinctness and in its
          whole strength. At bottom it is the expression of the consciousness
          in the brute that its true being lies more immediately in the
          species than in the individual, and therefore, when necessary, it
          sacrifices its life that the species may be maintained in the
          young. Thus here, as also in the sexual impulse, the will to live
          becomes to a certain extent transcendent, for its consciousness
          extends beyond the individual, in which it is inherent, to the
          species. In order to avoid expressing this second manifestation of
          the life of the species in a merely abstract manner, and to present
          it to the reader in its magnitude and reality, I will give a few
          examples of the extraordinary strength of instinctive maternal
          affection.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sea-otter,
          when pursued, seizes its young one and dives with it; when it comes
          up again to take breath, it covers the young one with its body, and
          receives the harpoon of the hunter while the young one is escaping.
          A young whale is killed merely to attract the mother, who hurries
          to it and seldom forsakes it so long as it still lives, even
          although she is struck with several harpoons (Scoresby's
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Journal of a Whaling Voyage;”</span> from
          the English of Kreis, p. 196). At Three Kings Island, near New
          Zealand, there are colossal seals called sea-elephants (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">phoca proboscidea</span></span>). They swim
          round the island in regular herds and feed upon fishes, but yet
          have certain terrible enemies below water unknown to us, by whom
          they are often severely wounded; hence their swimming together
          requires special tactics. The females bring forth their young upon
          the shore; while they are suckling them, which lasts from seven to
          eight weeks, all the males form a circle round them in order to
          prevent them, driven by hunger, from entering the sea, and if this
          is attempted they prevent it by biting. Thus they all fast together
          for between seven and eight weeks, and all become very thin, simply
          in order that the young may not enter the sea before they
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page317">[pg 317]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg317"></a> are able to swim
          well and observe the necessary tactics which are then taught them
          with blows and bites (Freycinet, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Voy. aux terres
          Australes</span></span>, 1826). We also see here how parental
          affection, like every strong exertion of the will (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">cf.</span></span>
          chap. xix. 6), heightens the intelligence. Wild ducks,
          white-throats, and many other birds, when the sportsman comes near
          their nest, fly in front of him with loud cries and flap about as
          if their wings were injured, in order to attract his attention from
          their young to themselves. The lark tries to entice the dog away
          from its nest by exposing itself. In the same way hinds and does
          induce the hunter to pursue them in order that their young may not
          be attacked. Swallows have flown into burning houses to rescue
          their young or perish with them. At Delft, in a great fire, a stork
          allowed itself to be burnt in its nest rather than forsake its
          tender young, which could not yet fly (Hadr. Junius, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Descriptio
          Hollandiæ</span></span>). Mountain-cocks and woodcocks allow
          themselves to be taken upon the nest when brooding. <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Muscicapa tyrannus</span></span> protects its
          nest with remarkable courage, and defends itself against eagles. An
          ant has been cut in two, and the fore half been seen to bring the
          pupæ to a place of safety. A bitch whose litter had been cut out of
          her belly crept up to them dying, caressed them, and began to whine
          violently only when they were taken from her (Burdach, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Physiologie als

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now whether this
          also holds good of mental (subjective, internal) qualities, so that
          these also are transmitted by the parents to the children, is a
          question which has already often been raised, and almost always
          answered in the affirmative. More difficult, however, is the
          problem whether it is possible to distinguish what belongs to the
          father and what to the mother, thus what is the mental inheritance
          which we receive from each of our parents. If now we cast upon this
          problem the light of our fundamental knowledge that the will is the
          true being, the kernel, the radical element in man, and the
          intellect, on the other hand, is what is secondary, adventitious,
          the accident of that substance; before questioning experience we
          will assume it as at least probable that the father, as <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">sexus potior</span></span> and the procreative
          principle, imparts the basis, the radical element, of the new life,
          thus the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em>, and the mother, as
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">sexus sequior</span></span> and merely
          conceiving principle, imparts the secondary element, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intellect</span></em>; that thus the man
          inherits his moral nature, his character, his inclinations, his
          heart, from the father, and, on the other hand, the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page319">[pg 319]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg319"></a> grade, quality, and tendency of his
          intelligence from the mother. Now this assumption actually finds
          its confirmation in experience; only this cannot be decided by a
          physical experiment upon the table, but results partly from the
          careful and acute observation of many years, and partly from
          history.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One's own
          experience has the advantage of complete certainty and the greatest
          speciality, and this outweighs the disadvantage that arises from
          it, that its sphere is limited and its examples not generally
          known. Therefore, primarily, I refer every one to his own
          experience. First of all let him consider himself, confess to
          himself his inclinations and passions, his characteristic errors
          and weaknesses, his vices, and also his excellences and virtues, if
          he has any. Then let him think of his father, and he cannot fail to
          recognise all these characteristic traits in him also. On the other
          hand, he will often find his mother of an entirely different
          character, and a moral agreement with her will very seldom occur,
          indeed only through the exceptional accident of a similarity of the
          character of the two parents. Let him make this examination, for
          example, with reference to quick temper or patience, avarice or
          prodigality, inclination to sensuality, or to intemperance, or to
          gambling, hard-heartedness or kindliness, honesty or hypocrisy,
          pride or condescension, courage or cowardice, peaceableness or
          quarrelsomeness, placability or resentfulness, &amp;c. Then let him
          make the same investigation with regard to all those whose
          characters and whose parents he has accurately known. If he
          proceeds attentively, with correct judgment, and candidly, the
          confirmation of our principle will not be lacking. Thus, for
          example, he will find the special tendency to lie, which belongs to
          many men, equally present in two brothers, because they have
          inherited it from the father; on this account also the comedy,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“The Liar and his Son,”</span> is
          psychologically correct. However, two inevitable limitations must
          here be borne in mind, which only open <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page320">[pg 320]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg320"></a> injustice could interpret as evasions. First,
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">pater semper incertus</span></span>. Only a
          decided physical resemblance to the father removes this limitation;
          a superficial resemblance, on the other hand, is not sufficient to
          do so; for there is an after-effect of earlier impregnation by
          virtue of which the children of the second marriage have sometimes
          still a slight resemblance to the first husband, and children
          begotten in adultery to the legitimate father. Such an after-effect
          has been still more distinctly observed in the case of brutes. The
          second limitation is, that in the son the moral character of the
          father certainly appears, yet under the modification which it has
          received through another and often very different <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intellect</span></em> (the inheritance from
          the mother), and thus a correction of the observation becomes
          necessary. This modification may be important or trifling in
          proportion to that difference, but it can never be so great that
          the fundamental traits of the paternal character do not always
          appear under it recognisably enough, like a man who has disguised
          himself by an entirely different kind of dress, wig, and beard. For
          example, if by inheritance from the mother a man is pre-eminently
          endowed with reason, thus with the power of reflection and
          deliberation, the passions inherited from his father are partly
          bridled by this, partly concealed, and accordingly only attain to a
          methodical, systematic, or secret manifestation, and thus a very
          different phenomenon from that of the father, who perhaps had only
          a very limited mind, will then result; and in the same way the
          converse case may occur. The inclinations and passions of the
          mother, on the other hand, do not reappear at all in the children,
          often indeed their opposite.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Historical
          examples have the advantage over those of private life of being
          universally known; but, on the other hand, they are of course
          impaired by the uncertainty and frequent falsification of all
          tradition, and especially also by the fact that as a rule they only
          contain the public, not the private life, and consequently only the
          political actions, not the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page321">[pg 321]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg321"></a> finer manifestations of character. However, I
          wish to support the truth we are speaking of by a few historical
          examples, to which those who have made a special study of history
          can no doubt add a far larger number of equally pertinent
          cases.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is well known
          that P. Decius Mus sacrificed his life for his country with heroic
          nobleness; for, solemnly committing himself and the enemy to the

          Latins. About forty years later his son, of the same name, did
          exactly the same thing in the war against the Gauls (Liv. viii. 6;

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Early Roman
          history presents to us whole families whose members in long
          succession distinguished themselves by devoted patriotism and
          courage; such were the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">gens Fabia</span></span> and the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">gens
          Fabricia</span></span>. Again, Alexander the Great was fond of
          power and conquest, like his father Philip. The pedigree of Nero
          which, with a moral intention, Suetonius (c. 4 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">et</span></span> 5)
          gives at the beginning of his sketch of this monster is very well
          worth considering. It is the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">gens Claudia</span></span> he describes, which
          flourished in Rome through six centuries, and produced not only
          capable, but arrogant and cruel men. From it sprang Tiberius,
          Caligula, and finally Nero. In his grandfather, and still more
          strongly in his father, all those atrocious qualities show
          themselves, which could only attain their perfect development in
          Nero, partly because his higher position afforded them freer scope,
          partly because he had for his mother the irrational Bacchante,
          Agrippina, who could impart to him no intellect to bridle his
          passions. Quite in our sense, therefore, Suetonius relates that at
          his birth <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">præsagio fuit etiam Domitii,
          patris, vox, inter gratulationes amicorum, negantis, quidquam ex

          the other hand, Cimon was the son of Miltiades, and Hannibal of
          Hamilcar, and the Scipios make up a whole family of heroes and
          noble defenders of their country. But the son of Pope Alexander VI.
          was his hideous image, Cæsar Borgia. The son of the notorious Duke
          of Alba was just as cruel and wicked a man as his father. The
          malicious and unjust Philip IV. of France, who is specially known
          by his cruel torture and execution of the knights templars, had for
          his daughter Isabella, wife of Edward II. of England, who rebelled
          against her husband, took him prisoner, and after he had signed his
          abdication, since the attempt to kill him by ill-usage was
          unsuccessful, caused him to be put to death in prison in a manner
          which is too horrible for me to care to relate. The blood-thirsty
          tyrant and <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">defensor fidei</span></span>,
          Henry VIII. of England had a daughter by his first marriage, Queen
          Mary, equally distinguished for bigotry and cruelty, who from her
          numerous burnings of heretics has won the name of Bloody Mary. His
          daughter by his second marriage, Elizabeth, received an excellent
          understanding from her mother, Anne Boleyn, which prevented bigotry
          and curbed the parental character in her, yet did not do away with
          it; so that it still always shone through on occasions, and
          distinctly appeared in her cruel treatment of Mary of Scotland. Van
          Geuns<a href="#note_35" id="noteref_35" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">35</span></span></a> tells
          a story, after Marcus Donatus, of a Scotch girl whose father had
          been burnt as a highway robber and a cannibal when she was only one
          year old. Although she was brought up among quite different people,
          there developed in her the same craving for human flesh, and being
          caught in the act of satisfying it, she was buried alive. In the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Freimüthigen</span></span> of the 13th July
          1821 we read that in the department of Aube the police pursued a
          girl because she had murdered two children, whom she ought to have
          taken to the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page323">[pg
          323]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg323"></a>
          foundling hospital, in order to keep the little money given to the
          children. At last the police found the girl on the road to Paris,
          near Romilly, drowned, and her own father gave himself up as her
          murderer. Finally, let me mention a couple of cases which have
          occurred recently, and have therefore only the newspapers as their
          vouchers. In October 1836 a Count Belecznai was condemned to death
          in Hungary because he had murdered an official and severely wounded
          his own relations. His elder brother was executed earlier as a
          patricide, and his father also had been a murderer (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Frankfurter
          Postzeitung</span></span> of the 26th October 1836). A year later
          the youngest brother of this Count, in the same street where the
          latter had murdered the official, fired a pistol at the steward of
          his estates, but missed him (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Frankfurter Journal</span></span>, 16th
          September 1837). In the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Frankfurter Postzeitung</span></span> of the
          19th November 1857 a correspondent in Paris announces the
          condemnation to death of a very dangerous highway robber, Lemaire,
          and his companions, and adds: <span class="tei tei-q">“The criminal
          tendency seems hereditary in his family and in those of his
          confederates, as several of their race have died on the
          scaffold.”</span> It follows from a passage in the Laws of Plato
          that similar cases were already known in Greece (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Stob.
          Flor.</span></span>, vol. ii. p. 213). The annals of crime will
          certainly have many similar pedigrees to show. The tendency to
          suicide is specially hereditary.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the other
          hand, when we see the excellent Marcus Aurelius have the wicked
          Commodus for a son, this does not not lead us astray; for we know
          that the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Diva Faustina</span></span> was a <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">uxor infamis</span></span>. On the contrary,
          we mark this case in order in analogous cases to presume an
          analogous reason; for example, that Domitian was the full brother
          of Titus I can never believe, but that Vespasian also was a
          deceived husband.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now, as regards
          the second part of the principle set up thus the inheritance of the
          intellect from the mother, this enjoys a far more general
          acceptance than the first part, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page324">[pg 324]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg324"></a> which in itself appeals to the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">liberum arbitrium indifferentiæ</span></span>,
          while its separate apprehension is opposed by the doctrine of the
          simplicity and indivisibility of the soul. Even the old and popular
          expression <span class="tei tei-q">“mother-wit”</span> shows the
          early recognition of this second truth, which depends upon the
          experience both with regard to small and great intellectual
          endowments, that they are the possession of those whose mothers
          proportionately distinguished themselves by their intelligence.
          That, on the other hand, the intellectual qualities of the father
          are not transmitted to the son is proved both by the fathers and
          the sons of men distinguished by the most eminent faculties, for,
          as a rule, they are quite ordinary men, without a trace of the
          paternal mental gifts. But if now an isolated exception to this
          experience, so often confirmed, should appear; such, for example,
          as is presented by Pitt and his father, Lord Chatham, we are
          warranted in ascribing it to accident, nay, obliged to do so,
          although, on account of the exceptional rarity of great talents, it
          is certainly an accident of a most extraordinary kind. Here,
          however, the rule holds good: it is improbable that the improbable
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">never</span></em> happens. Besides, great
          statesmen (as was already mentioned in chapter 22) are so just as
          much through the qualities of their character, thus through what is
          inherited from the father, as through the superiority of their
          mind. On the other hand, among artists, poets, and philosophers, to
          whose works alone <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">genius</span></em> is properly ascribed, I
          know of no case analogous to that. Raphael's father was certainly a
          painter, but not a great one; Mozart's father, and also his son,
          were musicians, but not great ones. However, it is indeed wonderful
          that the fate which had destined a very short life to both of these
          men, each the greatest in his own sphere, as it were by way of
          compensation, took care, by letting them be born already in their
          workshop, that, without suffering the loss of time in youth which
          for the most part occurs in the case of other men of genius, they
          received even from childhood, through <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page325">[pg 325]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg325"></a> paternal example and instruction, the
          necessary introduction into the art to which they were exclusively
          destined. This secret and mysterious power which seems to guide the
          individual life I have made the subject of special investigations,
          which I have communicated in the essay, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ueber die scheinbare Absichtlichkeit im
          Schicksale des Einzelnen</span></span>”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Parerga</span></span>, vol. i.). It is further
          to be observed here that there are certain scientific occupations
          which certainly presuppose good native faculties, yet not those
          which are really rare and extraordinary; while the principal
          requirements are zealous efforts, diligence, patience, early
          instruction, sustained study, and much practice. From this, and not
          from the inheritance of the intellect of the father, the fact is to
          be explained that, since the son always willingly follows the path
          that has been opened up by the father, and almost all businesses
          are hereditary in certain families, in some sciences also, which
          before everything demand diligence and persistence, individual
          families can show a succession of men of merit; such are the
          Scaligers, the Bernouillis, the Cassinis, the Herschels.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The number of
          proofs of the actual inheritance of the intellect of the mother
          would be much greater than it appears if it were not that the
          character and disposition of the female sex is such that women
          rarely give public proof of their mental faculties; and therefore
          these do not become historical, and thus known to posterity.
          Besides, on account of the weaker nature in general of the female
          sex, these faculties themselves can never reach the grade in them
          to which they may afterwards rise in the son; thus, with reference
          to themselves, we have to estimate their achievements higher in
          this proportion. Accordingly, in the first instance, only the
          following examples present themselves as proofs of our truth.
          Joseph II. was the son of Maria Theresia. Cardanus says in the
          third chapter, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De vita
          propria</span></span>:”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Mater mea fuit memoria et ingenio
          pollens</span></span>.”</span> J. J. Rousseau says in the first
          book of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Confessions:”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">La beauté de ma
          mère, son</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page326">[pg
          326]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg326"></a><span style="font-style: italic">esprit, ses
          talents,—elle en avait de trop brillans pour son
          état</span></span>,”</span> &amp;c., and then quotes some
          delightful lines of hers. D'Alembert was the illegitimate son of
          Claudine de Tencin, a woman of superior mind, and the author of
          several romances and similar works, which met with great
          approbation in her day, and should even still be enjoyable (see her
          biography in the <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Blätter für
          litterarische Unterhaltung</span></span>,”</span> March 1845, Nos.
          71-73). That Buffon's mother was a remarkable woman is shown by the
          following passage from the <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Voyage à Montbar, par
          Hérault de Sechelles</span></span>,”</span> which Flourens quotes
          in his <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Histoire des travaux
          de Buffon</span></span>,”</span> p. 288: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">Buffon avait ce principe
          qu'en général les enfants tenaient de leur mère leurs qualités
          intellectuelles et morales: et lorsqu'il l'avait développé dans la
          conversation, il en faisait sur-le-champ l'application à lui-même,
          en faisant un éloge pompeux de sa mère, qui avait en effet,
          beaucoup d'esprit, des connaissances étandues, et une tête très
          bien organisée.</span></span>”</span> That he includes the moral
          qualities is an error which is either committed by the reporter, or
          depends upon the fact that his mother had accidentally the same
          character as himself and his father. The contrary of this is shown
          in innumerable cases in which the mother and the son have opposite
          characters. Hence the greatest dramatists could present, in Orestes
          and Hamlet, mother and son in hostile conflict, in which the son
          appears as the moral representative and avenger of his father. On
          the other hand, the converse case, that the son should appear as
          the moral representative and avenger of the mother against the
          father, would be revolting and, at the same time, almost absurd.
          This depends upon the fact that between father and son there is
          actual identity of nature, which is the will, but between mother
          and son there is merely identity of intellect, and even this only
          in a conditioned manner. Between mother and son the greatest moral
          opposition can exist, between father and son only an intellectual
          opposition. From this point of view, also, one should recognise the
          necessity of the Salic <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page327">[pg
          327]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg327"></a>
          law: the woman cannot carry on the race. Hume says in his short
          autobiography: <span class="tei tei-q">“Our mother was a woman of
          singular merit.”</span> It is said of Kant's mother in the most
          recent biography by F. W. Schubert: <span class="tei tei-q">“According to the judgment of her son himself, she was
          a woman of great natural understanding. For that time, when there
          was so little opportunity for the education of girls, she was
          exceptionally well instructed, and she also continued later to care
          for her further education by herself. In the course of walks she
          drew the attention of her son to all kinds of natural phenomena,
          and tried to explain to him through them the power of God.”</span>
          What a remarkably able, clever, and superior woman Goethe's mother
          was is now universally known. How much she has been spoken of in
          literature! while his father has not been spoken of at all; Goethe
          himself describes him as a man of subordinate faculties. Schiller's
          mother was susceptible to poetry, and made verses herself, a
          fragment of which will be found in his biography by Schwab. Bürger,
          that genuine poetic genius, to whom perhaps the first place after
          Goethe among German poets belongs—for compared with his ballads
          those of Schiller seem cold and laboured—has given an account of
          his parents which for us is significant, and which his friend and
          physician, Althof repeats in his biography which appeared in 1798,
          in these words: <span class="tei tei-q">“Bürger's father was
          certainly provided with a variety of knowledge after the manner of
          study prevalent at the time, and was also a good, honourable man;
          but he loved his quiet comfort and his pipe of tobacco so much,
          that, as my friend used to say, he had always first to pull himself
          together if he was going to apply himself for a quarter of an hour
          or so to the instruction of his son. His wife was a woman of
          extraordinary mental endowments, which, however, were so little
          cultivated that she had scarcely learnt to write legibly. Bürger
          thought that with proper culture his mother would have been the
          most famous of her sex, although he several times expressed a
          strong disapproval of different traits of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page328">[pg 328]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg328"></a> her moral character. However, he believed
          that he inherited from his mother some mental gifts, and from his
          father an agreement with his moral character.”</span> Walter
          Scott's mother was a poetess, and was in communication with the
          wits of her time, as we learn from the obituary notice of Walter
          Scott in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Globe</span></span> of 24th September 1832.
          That poems of hers appeared in print in 1789 I find from an article
          entitled <span class="tei tei-q">“Mother-wit,”</span> in the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Blätter
          für litterarische Unterhaltung</span></span> of 4th October 1841,
          published by Brockhaus, which gives a long list of clever mothers
          of distinguished men, from which I shall only take two:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Bacon's mother was a distinguished
          linguist, wrote and translated several works, and in all of them
          showed learning, acuteness, and taste. Boerhave's mother
          distinguished herself through medical knowledge.”</span> On the
          other hand, Haller has preserved for us a strong proof of the
          inheritance of the mental weakness of the mother, for he says:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">E duabus patriciis
          sororibus, ob divitias maritos nactis, quum tamen fatuis essent
          proximæ, novimus in nobilissimas gentes nunc a seculo retro ejus
          morbi manasse semina, ut etiam in quarta generatione, quintave,
          omnium posterorum aliqui fatui supersint</span></span>”</span>
          (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Elementa
          physiol.</span></span>, Lib. xxix. § 8). Also, according to
          Esquirol, madness is more frequently inherited from the mother than
          the father. If, however, it is inherited from the father, I
          attribute this to the disposition of the character whose influence
          occasions it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It seems to
          follow from our principle that sons of the same mother have equal
          mental capacity, and if one should be highly gifted the other must
          be so also. Sometimes it is so. Examples of this are the Carracci,
          Joseph and Michael Haydn, Bernard and Andreas Romberg, George and
          Frederic Cuvier. I would also add the brothers Schlegel, if it were
          not that the younger, Friedrich, made himself unworthy of the
          honour of being named along with his excellent, blameless, and
          highly distinguished brother, August Wilhelm, by the disgraceful
          obscurantism which in the last quarter of his life he pursued along
          with Adam <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page329">[pg
          329]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg329"></a>
          Müller. For obscurantism is a sin, possibly not against the Holy
          Spirit, but yet against the human spirit, which one ought therefore
          never to forgive, but always and everywhere implacably to remember
          against whoever has been guilty of it, and take every opportunity
          of showing contempt for him so long as he lives, nay, after he is
          dead. But just as often the above result does not take place; for
          example, Kant's brother was quite an ordinary man. To explain this
          I must remind the reader of what is said in the thirty-first
          chapter on the physiological conditions of genius. Not only an
          extraordinarily developed and absolutely correctly formed brain
          (the share of the mother) is required, but also a very energetic
          action of the heart to animate it, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          subjectively a passionate will, a lively temperament: this is the
          inheritance from the father. But this quality is at its height only
          during the father's strongest years; and the mother ages still more
          quickly. Accordingly the highly gifted sons will, as a rule, be the
          eldest, begotten in the full strength of both parents; thus Kant's
          brother was eleven years younger than him. Even in the case of two
          distinguished brothers, as a rule, the elder will be the superior.
          But not only the age, but every temporary ebb of the vital force or
          other disturbance of health in the parents at the time when the
          child is begotten may interfere with the part of one or other, and
          prevent the appearance of a man of eminent talent, which is
          therefore so exceedingly rare a phenomenon. It may be said, in
          passing, that in the case of twins the absence of all the
          differences just mentioned is the cause of the quasi-identity of
          their nature.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If single cases
          should be found in which a highly gifted son had a mother who was
          not mentally distinguished at all, this may be explained from the
          fact that this mother herself had a phlegmatic father, and on this
          account her more than ordinarily developed brain was not adequately
          excited by a corresponding energy of the circulation—a necessary
          condition, as I have explained <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page330">[pg 330]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg330"></a> above in chapter 31. Nevertheless, her highly
          perfected nervous and cerebral system was transmitted to the son,
          in whose case a father with a lively and passionate disposition and
          an energetic action of the heart was added, and thus the other
          physical condition of great mental power first appeared here.
          Perhaps this was Byron's case, since we nowhere find the mental
          advantages of his mother mentioned. The same explanation is also to
          be applied to the case in which the mother of a son of genius who
          was herself distinguished for mental gifts had a mother who was by
          no means clever, for the father of the latter has been a man of a
          phlegmatic disposition.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
          inharmonious, disproportionate, ambiguous element in the character
          of most men might perhaps be referred to the fact that the
          individual has not a simple origin, but derives the will from the
          father and the intellect from the mother. The more heterogeneous
          and ill-adapted to each other the two parents were, the greater
          will that want of harmony, that inner variance, be. While some
          excel through their heart and others through their head, there are
          still others whose excellence lies in a certain harmony and unity
          of the whole nature, which arises from the fact that in them heart
          and head are so thoroughly adapted that they mutually support and
          advance each other; which leads us to assume that the parents were
          peculiarly suited to each other, and agreed in an exceptional
          measure.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With reference
          to the physiological side of the theory set forth, I wish now to
          mention that Burdach, who erroneously assumes that the same
          psychical qualities may be inherited now from the father, now from
          the mother, yet adds (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Physiologie als
          Erfahrungswissenschaft</span></span>, vol. i. § 306): <span class="tei tei-q">“As a whole, the male element has more influence in
          determining the irritable life, and the female element, on the
          other hand, has more influence on the sensibility.”</span> What
          Linné says in the <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Systema
          naturæ</span></span>,”</span> Tom. i. p. 8, is also in point here:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Mater prolifera
          promit, ante generationem,</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page331">[pg 331]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg331"></a><span style="font-style: italic">vivum

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If we now
          connect the conviction we have gained here of the inheritance of
          the character from the father and the intellect from the mother
          with our earlier investigation of the wide gulf which nature has
          placed between man and man in a moral as in an intellectual regard,
          and also with our knowledge of the absolute unalterableness both of
          the character and of the mental faculties, we shall be led to the
          view that a real and thorough improvement of the human race might
          be attained to not so much from without as from within, thus not so
          much by instruction and culture as rather upon the path of
          generation. Plato had already something of the kind in his mind
          when in the fifth book of his Republic he set forth his wonderful
          plan for increasing and improving his class of warriors. If we
          could castrate all scoundrels, and shut up all stupid geese in
          monasteries, and give persons of noble character a whole harem, and
          provide men, and indeed complete men, for all maidens of mind and
          understanding, a generation would soon arise which would produce a
          better age than that of Pericles. But, without entering into such
          utopian plans, it might be taken into consideration that if, as, if
          I am not mistaken, was actually the case among certain ancient
          nations, castration was the severest punishment after death, the
          world would be delivered from whole races of scoundrels, all the
          more certainly as it is well known that most crimes are committed
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page332">[pg 332]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg332"></a> between the age of
          twenty and thirty.<a href="#note_36" id="noteref_36" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">36</span></span></a> In the
          same way, it might be considered whether, as regards results, it
          would not be more advantageous to give the public dowries which
          upon certain occasions have to be distributed, not, as is now
          customary, to the girls who are supposed to be the most virtuous,
          but to those who have most understanding and are the cleverest;
          especially as it is very difficult to judge as to virtue, for, as
          it is said, only God sees the heart. The opportunities for
          displaying a noble character are rare, and a matter of chance;
          besides, many a girl has a powerful support to her virtue in her
          plainness; on the other hand, as regards understanding, those who
          themselves are gifted with it can judge with great certainty after
          some examination. The following is another practical application.
          In many countries, among others in South Germany, the bad custom
          prevails of women carrying burdens, often very considerable, upon
          the head. This must act disadvantageously upon the brain, which
          must thereby gradually deteriorate in the female sex of the nation;
          and since from that sex the male sex receives its brain, the whole
          nation becomes ever more stupid; which in many cases is by no means
          necessary. Accordingly by the abolition of this custom the quantum
          of intelligence in the whole nation would be increased, which would
          positively be the greatest increase of the national wealth.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But if now,
          leaving such practical applications to others, we return to our
          special point of view, the ethico-metaphysical standpoint—since we
          connect the content of chapter 41 with that of the present
          chapter—the following <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page333">[pg
          333]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg333"></a>
          result will present itself to us, which, with all its
          transcendence, has yet a direct empirical support. It is the same
          character, thus the same individually determined will, that lives
          in all the descendants of one stock, from the remote ancestor to
          the present representative of the family. But in each of these a
          different intellect is given with it, thus a different degree and a
          different kind of knowledge. Thus in each of these life presents
          itself to it from another side and in a different light: it
          receives a new fundamental view of it, a new instruction. It is
          true that, since the intellect is extinguished with the individual,
          that will cannot supplement the insight of one course of life with
          that of another. But in consequence of each fundamentally new view
          of life, such as only a renewed personality can impart to it, its
          willing itself receives a different tendency, thus experiences a
          modification from it, and what is the chief concern, the will, has,
          in this new direction, either to assert life anew or deny it. In
          this way does the arrangement of nature of an ever-changing
          connection of a will with an intellect, which arises from the
          necessity of two sexes for reproduction, become the basis of a
          method of salvation. For by virtue of this arrangement life
          unceasingly presents new sides to the will (whose image and mirror
          it is), turns itself about, as it were, without intermission before
          its sight, allows different and ever different modes of perception
          to try their effect upon it, so that upon each of these it must
          decide for assertion or denial, both of which constantly stand open
          to it, only that, if once denial is chosen, the whole phenomenon
          ceases for it with death. Now because, according to this, it is
          just the constant renewal and complete alteration of the intellect
          for the same will which, as imparting a new view of the world,
          holds open the path of salvation, and because the intellect comes
          from the mother, the profound reason may lie here on account of
          which all nations (with very few and doubtful exceptions) abominate
          and forbid the marriage of brothers and sisters, nay, even on
          account of which sexual love does not arise at all between brothers
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page334">[pg 334]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg334"></a> and sisters, unless
          in very rare exceptions, which depend upon an unnatural perversity
          of the instinct, if not upon the fact that one of the two is
          illegitimate. For from a marriage of brothers and sisters nothing
          could proceed but constantly ever the same will with the same
          intellect, as both already exist united in both the parents, thus
          the hopeless repetition of the phenomenon which has already
          been.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But if now, in
          the particular case and close at hand, we contemplate the
          incredibly great and yet manifest difference of characters—find one
          so good and philanthropic, another so wicked, nay, ferocious;
          again, behold one just, honest, and upright, and another completely
          false, as a sneak, a swindler, a traitor, an incorrigible
          scoundrel—there discloses itself to us a chasm in our
          investigation, for in vain we ponder, reflecting on the origin of
          such a difference. Hindus and Buddhists solve the problem by
          saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“It is the consequence of the deeds
          of the preceding courses of life.”</span> This solution is
          certainly the oldest, also the most comprehensible, and has come
          from the wisest of mankind; but it only pushes the question further
          back. Yet a more satisfactory answer will hardly be found. From the
          point of view of my whole teaching, it remains for me to say that
          here, where we are speaking of the will as thing in itself, the
          principle of sufficient reason, as merely the form of the
          phenomenon, is no longer applicable; with it, however, all why and
          whence disappear. Absolute freedom just consists in this, that
          something is not subject at all to the principle of sufficient
          reason, as the principle of all necessity. Such freedom, therefore,
          only belongs to the thing in itself. And this is just the will.
          Accordingly, in its phenomenal manifestation, consequently in the
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Operari</span></span>, it is subject to
          necessity; but in the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Esse</span></span>,
          where it has determined itself as thing in itself, it is free.
          Whenever, therefore, we come to this, as happens here, all
          explanation by means of reasons and consequents ceases, and nothing
          remains for us but to say that here manifests itself <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page335">[pg 335]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg335"></a> the true freedom of the will, which
          belongs to it because it is the thing in itself, which, however,
          just as such, is groundless, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, knows no why. But on this
          account all understanding ceases for us here, because all our
          understanding depends upon the principle of sufficient reason, for
          it consists in the mere application of that principle.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We are

          romances which for centuries every year has produced in all the
          civilised countries of Europe as regularly as the fruits of the
          earth. As regards their main contents, all these works are nothing
          else than many-sided brief or lengthy descriptions of the passion
          we are speaking of. Moreover, the most successful pictures of
          it—such, for example, as Romeo and Juliet, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">La Nouvelle
          Hélöise</span></span>, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Werther</span></span>—have gained <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page337">[pg 337]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg337"></a> immortal fame. Yet, when Rochefoucauld
          imagines that it is the same with passionate love as with ghosts,
          of which every one speaks, but which no one has seen; and
          Lichtenberg also in his essay, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ueber die Macht der
          Liebe</span></span>,”</span> disputes and denies the reality and
          naturalness of that passion, they are greatly in error. For it is
          impossible that something which is foreign and contrary to human
          nature, thus a mere imaginary caricature, could be unweariedly
          represented by poetic genius in all ages, and received by mankind
          with unaltered interest; for nothing that is artistically beautiful
          can be without truth:—</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Certainly,
          however, it is also confirmed by experience, although not by the
          experience of every day, that that which as a rule only appears as
          a strong yet still controllable inclination may rise under certain
          circumstances to a passion which exceeds all others in vehemence,
          and which then sets aside all considerations, overcomes all
          obstacles with incredible strength and perseverance, so that for
          its satisfaction life is risked without hesitation, nay, if that
          satisfaction is still withheld, is given as the price of it.
          Werthers and Jacopo Ortis exist not only in romance, but every year
          can show at least half a dozen of them in Europe: <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Sed ignotis perierunt mortibus
          illi</span></span>; for their sorrows find no other chroniclers
          than the writers of official registers or the reporters of the
          newspapers. Yet the readers of the police news in English and
          French journals will attest the correctness of my assertion. Still
          greater, however, is the number of those whom the same passion
          brings to the madhouse. Finally, every year can show cases of the
          double suicide of a pair of lovers who are opposed by outward
          circumstances. In such cases, however, it is inexplicable to me how
          those who, certain of mutual love, expect to find the supremest
          bliss in the enjoyment of this, do not withdraw themselves from all
          connections <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page338">[pg
          338]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg338"></a>
          by taking the extremest steps, and endure all hardships, rather
          than give up with life a pleasure which is greater than any other
          they can conceive. As regards the lower grades of that passion, and
          the mere approaches to it, every one has them daily before his
          eyes, and, as long as he is not old, for the most part also in his
          heart.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So then, after
          what has here been called to mind, no one can doubt either the
          reality or the importance of the matter; and therefore, instead of
          wondering that a philosophy should also for once make its own this
          constant theme of all poets, one ought rather to be surprised that
          a thing which plays throughout so important a part in human life
          has hitherto practically been disregarded by philosophers
          altogether, and lies before us as raw material. The one who has
          most concerned himself with it is Plato, especially in the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Symposium”</span> and the <span class="tei tei-q">“Phædrus.”</span> Yet what he says on the subject is
          confined to the sphere of myths, fables, and jokes, and also for
          the most part concerns only the Greek love of youths. The little
          that Rousseau says upon our theme in the <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Discours sur l'inégalité</span></span>”</span>
          (p. 96, ed. Bip.) is false and insufficient. Kant's explanation of
          the subject in the third part of the essay, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ueber das Gefühl des Schönen und
          Erhabenen</span></span>”</span> (p. 435 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">seq.</span></span> of
          Rosenkranz's edition), is very superficial and without practical
          knowledge, therefore it is also partly incorrect. Lastly, Platner's
          treatment of the matter in his <span class="tei tei-q">“Anthropology”</span> (§ 1347 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">seq.</span></span>)
          every one will find dull and shallow. On the other hand, Spinoza's
          definition, on account of its excessive naïveté, deserves to be
          quoted for the sake of amusement: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Amor est titillatio,
          concomitante idea causæ externæ</span></span>”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Eth.</span></span>
          iv., prop. 44, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">dem.</span></span>) Accordingly I have no
          predecessors either to make use of or to refute. The subject has
          pressed itself upon me objectively, and has entered of its own
          accord into the connection of my consideration of the world.
          Moreover, least of all can I hope for approbation from those who
          are themselves under the power of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page339">[pg 339]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg339"></a> this passion, and who accordingly seek to
          express the excess of their feelings in the sublimest and most
          ethereal images. To them my view will appear too physical, too
          material, however metaphysical and even transcendent it may be at
          bottom. Meanwhile let them reflect that if the object which to-day
          inspires them to write madrigals and sonnets had been born eighteen
          years earlier it would scarcely have won a glance from them.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For all love,
          however ethereally it may bear itself, is rooted in the sexual
          impulse alone, nay, it absolutely is only a more definitely
          determined, specialised, and indeed in the strictest sense
          individualised sexual impulse. If now, keeping this in view, one
          considers the important part which the sexual impulse in all its
          degrees and nuances plays not only on the stage and in novels, but
          also in the real world, where, next to the love of life, it shows
          itself the strongest and most powerful of motives, constantly lays
          claim to half the powers and thoughts of the younger portion of
          mankind, is the ultimate goal of almost all human effort, exerts an
          adverse influence on the most important events, interrupts the most
          serious occupations every hour, sometimes embarrasses for a while
          even the greatest minds, does not hesitate to intrude with its
          trash interfering with the negotiations of statesmen and the
          investigations of men of learning, knows how to slip its love
          letters and locks of hair even into ministerial portfolios and
          philosophical manuscripts, and no less devises daily the most
          entangled and the worst actions, destroys the most valuable
          relationships, breaks the firmest bonds, demands the sacrifice
          sometimes of life or health, sometimes of wealth, rank, and
          happiness, nay, robs those who are otherwise honest of all
          conscience, makes those who have hitherto been faithful, traitors;
          accordingly, on the whole, appears as a malevolent demon that
          strives to pervert, confuse, and overthrow everything;—then one
          will be forced to cry, Wherefore all this noise? Wherefore the
          straining and storming, the anxiety and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page340">[pg 340]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg340"></a> want? It is merely a question of every Hans
          finding his Grethe.<a href="#note_37" id="noteref_37" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">37</span></span></a> Why
          should such a trifle play so important a part, and constantly
          introduce disturbance and confusion into the well-regulated life of
          man? But to the earnest investigator the spirit of truth gradually
          reveals the answer. It is no trifle that is in question here; on
          the contrary, the importance of the matter is quite proportionate
          to the seriousness and ardour of the effort. The ultimate end of
          all love affairs, whether they are played in sock or cothurnus, is
          really more important than all other ends of human life, and is
          therefore quite worthy of the profound seriousness with which every
          one pursues it. That which is decided by it is nothing less than
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the
          composition of the next generation</span></em>. The <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">dramatis personæ</span></span> who shall
          appear when we are withdrawn are here determined, both as regards
          their existence and their nature, by these frivolous love affairs.
          As the being, the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">existentia</span></span>, of
          these future persons is absolutely conditioned by our sexual
          impulse generally, so their nature, <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">essentia</span></span>, is determined by the
          individual selection in its satisfaction, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          by sexual love, and is in every respect irrevocably fixed by this.
          This is the key of the problem: we shall arrive at a more accurate
          knowledge of it in its application if we go through the degrees of
          love, from the passing inclination to the vehement passion, when we
          shall also recognise that the difference of these grades arises
          from the degree of the individualisation of the choice.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The collective
          love affairs of the present generation taken together are
          accordingly, of the whole human race, the serious <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">meditatio compositionis generationis futuræ, e
          qua iterum pendent innumeræ generationes</span></span>. This high
          importance of the matter, in which it is not a question of
          individual weal or woe, as in all other matters, but of the
          existence and special nature of the human race in future times, and
          therefore the will of the individual appears <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page341">[pg 341]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg341"></a> at a higher power as the will of the
          species;—this it is on which the pathetic and sublime elements in
          affairs of love depend, which for thousands of years poets have
          never wearied of representing in innumerable examples; because no
          theme can equal in interest this one, which stands to all others
          which only concern the welfare of individuals as the solid body to
          the surface, because it concerns the weal and woe of the species.
          Just on this account, then, is it so difficult to impart interest
          to a drama without the element of love, and, on the other hand,
          this theme is never worn out even by daily use.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That which
          presents itself in the individual consciousness as sexual impulse
          in general, without being directed towards a definite individual of
          the other sex, is in itself, and apart from the phenomenon, simply
          the will to live. But what appears in consciousness as a sexual
          impulse directed to a definite individual is in itself the will to
          live as a definitely determined individual. Now in this case the
          sexual impulse, although in itself a subjective need, knows how to
          assume very skilfully the mask of an objective admiration, and thus
          to deceive our consciousness; for nature requires this stratagem to
          attain its ends. But yet that in every case of falling in love,
          however objective and sublime this admiration may appear, what
          alone is looked to is the production of an individual of a definite
          nature is primarily confirmed by the fact that the essential matter
          is not the reciprocation of love, but possession, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          the physical enjoyment. The certainty of the former can therefore
          by no means console us for the want of the latter; on the contrary,
          in such a situation many a man has shot himself. On the other hand,
          persons who are deeply in love, and can obtain no return of it, are
          contented with possession, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, with the physical
          enjoyment. This is proved by all forced marriages, and also by the
          frequent purchase of the favour of a woman, in spite of her
          dislike, by large presents or other sacrifices, nay, even by cases
          of rape. That this particular child <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page342">[pg 342]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg342"></a> shall be begotten is, although unknown to the
          parties concerned, the true end of the whole love story; the manner
          in which it is attained is a secondary consideration. Now, however
          loudly persons of lofty and sentimental soul, and especially those
          who are in love, may cry out here about the gross realism of my
          view, they are yet in error. For is not the definite determination
          of the individualities of the next generation a much higher and
          more worthy end than those exuberant feelings and super-sensible
          soap bubbles of theirs? Nay, among earthly aims, can there be one
          which is greater or more important? It alone corresponds to the
          profoundness with which passionate love is felt, to the seriousness
          with which it appears, and the importance which it attributes even
          to the trifling details of its sphere and occasion. Only so far as
          this end is assumed as the true one do the difficulties
          encountered, the infinite exertions and annoyances made and endured
          for the attainment of the loved object, appear proportionate to the
          matter. For it is the future generation, in its whole individual
          determinateness, that presses into existence by means of those
          efforts and toils. Nay, it is itself already active in that
          careful, definite, and arbitrary choice for the satisfaction of the
          sexual impulse which we call love. The growing inclination of two
          lovers is really already the will to live of the new individual
          which they can and desire to produce; nay, even in the meeting of
          their longing glances its new life breaks out, and announces itself
          as a future individuality harmoniously and well composed. They feel
          the longing for an actual union and fusing together into a single
          being, in order to live on only as this; and this longing receives
          its fulfilment in the child which is produced by them, as that in
          which the qualities transmitted by them both, fused and united in
          one being, live on. Conversely, the mutual, decided and persistent
          aversion between a man and a maid is a sign that what they could
          produce would only be a badly organised, in itself inharmonious
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page343">[pg 343]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg343"></a> and unhappy being.
          Hence there lies a deeper meaning in the fact that Calderon, though
          he calls the atrocious Semiramis the daughter of the air, yet
          introduces her as the daughter of rape followed by the murder of
          the husband.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But, finally,
          what draws two individuals of different sex exclusively to each
          other with such power is the will to live, which exhibits itself in
          the whole species, and which here anticipates in the individual
          which these two can produce an objectification of its nature
          answering to its aims. This individual will have the will, or
          character, from the father, the intellect from the mother, and the
          corporisation from both; yet, for the most part, the figure will
          take more after the father, the size after the mother,—according to
          the law which comes out in the breeding of hybrids among the
          brutes, and principally depends upon the fact that the size of the
          fœtus must conform to the size of the uterus. Just as inexplicable
          as the quite special individuality of any man, which is exclusively
          peculiar to him, is also the quite special and individual passion
          of two lovers; indeed at bottom the two are one and the same: the
          former is <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">explicite</span></span> what
          the latter was <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">implicite</span></span>. The
          moment at which the parents begin to love each other—to fancy each
          other, as the very happy English expression has it—is really to be
          regarded as the first appearance of a new individual and the true
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">punctum saliens</span></span> of its life,
          and, as has been said, in the meeting and fixing of their longing
          glances there appears the first germ of the new being, which
          certainly, like all germs, is generally crushed out. This new
          individual is to a certain extent a new (Platonic) Idea; and now,
          as all Ideas strive with the greatest vehemence to enter the
          phenomenal world, eagerly seizing for this end upon the matter
          which the law of causality divides among them all, so also does
          this particular Idea of a human individuality strive with the
          greatest eagerness and vehemence towards its realisation in the
          phenomenon. This eagerness and vehemence <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page344">[pg 344]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg344"></a> is just the passion of the two future parents
          for each other. It has innumerable degrees, the two extremes of
          which may at any rate be described as Αφροδιτη πανδημος and
          ουρανια; in its nature, however, it is everywhere the same. On the
          other hand, it will be in degree so much the more powerful the more
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">individualised</span></em> it is; that is, the
          more the loved individual is exclusively suited, by virtue of all
          his or her parts and qualities, to satisfy the desire of the lover
          and the need established by his or her own individuality. What is
          really in question here will become clear in the further course of
          our exposition. Primarily and essentially the inclination of love
          is directed to health, strength, and beauty, consequently also to
          youth; because the will first of all seeks to exhibit the specific
          character of the human species as the basis of all individuality:
          ordinary amorousness (Αφροδιτη πανδημος) does not go much further.
          To these, then, more special claims link themselves on, which we
          shall investigate in detail further on, and with which, when they
          see satisfaction before them, the passion increases. But the
          highest degrees of this passion spring from that suitableness of
          two individualities to each other on account of which the will,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the character, of the
          father and the intellect of the mother, in their connection, make
          up precisely that individual towards which the will to live in
          general which exhibits itself in the whole species feels a longing
          proportionate to this its magnitude, and which therefore exceeds
          the measure of a mortal heart, and the motives of which, in the
          same way, lie beyond the sphere of the individual intellect. This
          is thus the soul of a true and great passion. Now the more perfect
          is the mutual adaptation of two individuals to each other in each
          of the many respects which have further to be considered, the
          stronger will be their mutual passion. Since there do not exist two
          individuals exactly alike, there must be for each particular man a
          particular woman—always with reference to what is to be
          produced—who corresponds <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page345">[pg
          345]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg345"></a>
          most perfectly. A really passionate love is as rare as the accident
          of these two meeting. Since, however, the possibility of such a
          love is present in every one, the representations of it in the
          works of the poets are comprehensible to us. Just because the
          passion of love really turns about that which is to be produced,
          and its qualities, and because its kernel lies here, a friendship
          without any admixture of sexual love can exist between two young
          and good-looking persons of different sex, on account of the
          agreement of their disposition, character, and mental tendencies;
          nay, as regards sexual love there may even be a certain aversion
          between them. The reason of this is to be sought in the fact that a
          child produced by them would have physical or mental qualities
          which were inharmonious; in short, its existence and nature would
          not answer the ends of the will to live as it exhibits itself in
          the species. On the other hand, in the case of difference of
          disposition, character, and mental tendency, and the dislike, nay,
          enmity, proceeding from this, sexual love may yet arise and exist;
          when it then blinds us to all that; and if it here leads to
          marriage it will be a very unhappy one.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Let us now set
          about the more thorough investigation of the matter. Egoism is so
          deeply rooted a quality of all individuals in general, that in
          order to rouse the activity of an individual being egoistical ends
          are the only ones upon which we can count with certainty. Certainly
          the species has an earlier, closer, and greater claim upon the
          individual than the perishable individuality itself. Yet when the
          individual has to act, and even make sacrifices for the continuance
          and quality of the species, the importance of the matter cannot be
          made so comprehensible to his intellect, which is calculated merely
          with regard to individual ends, as to have its proportionate
          effect. Therefore in such a case nature can only attain its ends by
          implanting a certain illusion in the individual, on account of
          which that which is only a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page346">[pg 346]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg346"></a> good for the species appears to him as a good
          for himself, so that when he serves the species he imagines he is
          serving himself; in which process a mere chimera, which vanishes
          immediately afterwards, floats before him, and takes the place of a
          real thing as a motive. This illusion is instinct. In the great
          majority of cases this is to be regarded as the sense of the
          species, which presents what is of benefit to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">it</span></em> to
          the will. Since, however, the will has here become individual, it
          must be so deluded that it apprehends through the sense of the
          individual what the sense of the species presents to it, thus
          imagines it is following individual ends while in truth it is
          pursuing ends which are merely general (taking this word in its
          strictest sense). The external phenomenon of instinct we can best
          observe in the brutes where its rôle is most important; but it is
          in ourselves alone that we arrive at a knowledge of its internal
          process, as of everything internal. Now it is certainly supposed
          that man has almost no instinct; at any rate only this, that the
          new-born babe seeks for and seizes the breast of its mother. But,
          in fact, we have a very definite, distinct, and complicated
          instinct, that of the selection of another individual for the
          satisfaction of the sexual impulse, a selection which is so fine,
          so serious, and so arbitrary. With this satisfaction in itself,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, so far as it is a sensual
          pleasure resting upon a pressing want of the individual, the beauty
          or ugliness of the other individual has nothing to do. Thus the
          regard for this which is yet pursued with such ardour, together
          with the careful selection which springs from it, is evidently
          connected, not with the chooser himself—although he imagines it is
          so—but with the true end, that which is to be produced, which is to
          receive the type of the species as purely and correctly as
          possible. Through a thousand physical accidents and moral
          aberrations there arise a great variety of deteriorations of the
          human form; yet its true type, in all its parts, is always again
          established: and this takes place under the guidance <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page347">[pg 347]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg347"></a> of the sense of beauty, which always
          directs the sexual impulse, and without which this sinks to the
          level of a disgusting necessity. Accordingly, in the first place,
          every one will decidedly prefer and eagerly desire the most
          beautiful individuals, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, those in whom the
          character of the species is most purely impressed; but, secondly,
          each one will specially regard as beautiful in another individual
          those perfections which he himself lacks, nay, even those
          imperfections which are the opposite of his own. Hence, for
          example, little men love big women, fair persons like dark, &amp;c.
          &amp;c. The delusive ecstasy which seizes a man at the sight of a
          woman whose beauty is suited to him, and pictures to him a union
          with her as the highest good, is just the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sense of the
          species</span></em>, which, recognising the distinctly expressed
          stamp of the same, desires to perpetuate it with this individual.
          Upon this decided inclination to beauty depends the maintenance of
          the type of the species: hence it acts with such great power. We
          shall examine specially further on the considerations which it
          follows. Thus what guides man here is really an instinct which is
          directed to doing the best for the species, while the man himself
          imagines that he only seeks the heightening of his own pleasure. In
          fact, we have in this an instructive lesson concerning the inner
          nature of all instinct, which, as here, almost always sets the
          individual in motion for the good of the species. For clearly the
          pains with which an insect seeks out a particular flower, or fruit,
          or dung, or flesh, or, as in the case of the ichneumonidæ, the
          larva of another insect, in order to deposit its eggs there only,
          and to attain this end shrinks neither from trouble nor danger, is
          thoroughly analogous to the pains with which for his sexual
          satisfaction a man carefully chooses a woman with definite
          qualities which appeal to him individually, and strives so eagerly
          after her that in order to attain this end he often sacrifices his
          own happiness in life, contrary to all reason, by a foolish
          marriage, by love affairs which cost him wealth, honour, and life,
          even by crimes such as <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page348">[pg
          348]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg348"></a>
          adultery or rape, all merely in order to serve the species in the
          most efficient way, although at the cost of the individual, in
          accordance with the will of nature which is everywhere sovereign.
          Instinct, in fact, is always an act which seems to be in accordance
          with the conception of an end, and yet is entirely without such a
          conception. Nature implants it wherever the acting individual is
          incapable of understanding the end, or would be unwilling to pursue
          it. Therefore, as a rule, it is given only to the brutes, and
          indeed especially to the lowest of them which have least
          understanding; but almost only in the case we are here considering
          it is also given to man, who certainly could understand the end,
          but would not pursue it with the necessary ardour, that is, even at
          the expense of his individual welfare. Thus here, as in the case of
          all instinct, the truth assumes the form of an illusion, in order
          to act upon the will. It is a voluptuous illusion which leads the
          man to believe he will find a greater pleasure in the arms of a
          woman whose beauty appeals to him than in those of any other; or
          which indeed, exclusively directed to a single individual, firmly
          convinces him that the possession of her will ensure him excessive
          happiness. Therefore he imagines he is taking trouble and making
          sacrifices for his own pleasure, while he does so merely for the
          maintenance of the regular type of the species, or else a quite
          special individuality, which can only come from these parents, is
          to attain to existence. The character of instinct is here so
          perfectly present, thus an action which seems to be in accordance
          with the conception of an end, and yet is entirely without such a
          conception, that he who is drawn by that illusion often abhors the
          end which alone guides it, procreation, and would like to hinder
          it; thus it is in the case of almost all illicit love affairs. In
          accordance with the character of the matter which has been
          explained, every lover will experience a marvellous disillusion
          after the pleasure he has at last attained, and will wonder that
          what was so <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page349">[pg
          349]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg349"></a>
          longingly desired accomplishes nothing more than every other sexual
          satisfaction; so that he does not see himself much benefited by it.
          That wish was related to all his other wishes as the species is
          related to the individual, thus as the infinite to the finite. The
          satisfaction, on the other hand, is really only for the benefit of
          the species, and thus does not come within the consciousness of the
          individual, who, inspired by the will of the species, here served
          an end with every kind of sacrifice, which was not his own end at
          all. Hence, then, every lover, after the ultimate consummation of
          the great work, finds himself cheated; for the illusion has
          vanished by means of which the individual was here the dupe of the
          species, Accordingly Plato very happily says: <span class="tei tei-q">“ἡδονη ἁπαντων αλαζονεστατον”</span> (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">voluptas ommlum maxime
          vaniloqua</span></span>), <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phileb.</span></span> 319.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But all this
          reflects light on the instincts and mechanical tendencies of the
          brutes. They also are, without doubt, involved in a kind of
          illusion, which deceives them with the prospect of their own
          pleasure, while they work so laboriously and with so much
          self-denial for the species, the bird builds its nest, the insect
          seeks the only suitable place for its eggs, or even hunts for prey
          which, unsuited for its own enjoyment, must be laid beside the eggs
          as food for the future larvæ, the bees, the wasps, the ants apply
          themselves to their skilful dwellings and highly complicated
          economy. They are all guided with certainty by an illusion, which
          conceals the service of the species under the mask of an
          egotistical end. This is probably the only way to comprehend the
          inner or subjective process that lies at the foundation of the
          manifestations of instinct. Outwardly, however, or objectively, we
          find in those creatures which are to a large extent governed by
          instinct, especially in insects, a preponderance of the ganglion
          system, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">subjective</span></em> nervous system, over
          the objective or cerebral system; from which we must conclude that
          they are moved, not so much by objective, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page350">[pg 350]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg350"></a> proper apprehension as by subjective ideas
          exciting desire, which arise from the influence of the ganglion
          system upon the brain, and accordingly by a kind of illusion; and
          this will be the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">physiological</span></em> process in the case
          of all instinct. For the sake of illustration I will mention as
          another example of instinct in the human species, although a weak
          one, the capricious appetite of women who are pregnant. It seems to
          arise from the fact that the nourishment of the embryo sometimes
          requires a special or definite modification of the blood which
          flows to it, upon which the food which produces such a modification
          at once presents itself to the pregnant woman as an object of
          ardent longing, thus here also an illusion arises. Accordingly
          woman has one instinct more than man; and the ganglion system is
          also much more developed in the woman. That man has fewer instincts
          than the brutes and that even these few can be easily led astray,
          may be explained from the great preponderance of the brain in his
          case. The sense of beauty which instinctively guides the selection
          for the satisfaction of sexual passion is led astray when it
          degenerates into the tendency to pederasty; analogous to the fact
          that the blue-bottle (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Musca
          vomitoria</span></span>), instead of depositing its eggs, according
          to instinct, in putrefying flesh, lays them in the blossom of the
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Arum dracunculus</span></span>, deceived by
          the cadaverous smell of this plant.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now that an
          instinct entirely directed to that which is to be produced lies at
          the foundation of all sexual love will receive complete
          confirmation from the fuller analysis of it, which we cannot
          therefore avoid. First of all we have to remark here that by nature
          man is inclined to inconstancy in love, woman to constancy. The
          love of the man sinks perceptibly from the moment it has obtained
          satisfaction; almost every other woman charms him more than the one
          he already possesses; he longs for variety. The love of the woman,
          on the other hand, increases just from that moment. This is a
          consequence of the aim of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page351">[pg
          351]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg351"></a>
          nature which is directed to the maintenance, and therefore to the
          greatest possible increase, of the species. The man can easily
          beget over a hundred children a year; the woman, on the contrary,
          with however many men, can yet only bring one child a year into the
          world (leaving twin births out of account). Therefore the man
          always looks about after other women; the woman, again, sticks
          firmly to the one man; for nature moves her, instinctively and
          without reflection, to retain the nourisher and protector of the
          future offspring. Accordingly faithfulness in marriage is with the
          man artificial, with the woman it is natural, and thus adultery on
          the part of the woman is much less pardonable than on the part of
          the man, both objectively on account of the consequences and also
          subjectively on account of its unnaturalness.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But in order to
          be thorough and gain full conviction that the pleasure in the other
          sex, however objective it may seem to us, is yet merely disguised
          instinct, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, sense of the species,
          which strives to maintain its type, we must investigate more fully
          the considerations which guide us in this pleasure, and enter into
          the details of this, rarely as these details which will have to be
          mentioned here may have figured in a philosophical work before.
          These considerations divide themselves into those which directly
          concern the type of the species, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          beauty, those which are concerned with physical qualities, and
          lastly, those which are merely relative, which arise from the
          requisite correction or neutralisation of the one-sided qualities
          and abnormities of the two individuals by each other. We shall go
          through them one by one.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first
          consideration which guides our choice and inclination is age. In
          general we accept the age from the years when menstruation begins
          to those when it ceases, yet we give the decided preference to the
          period from the eighteenth to the twenty-eighth year. Outside of
          those years, on the other hand, no woman can attract us: an old
          woman, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, one who no longer
          menstruates, excites our <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page352">[pg
          352]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg352"></a>
          aversion. Youth without beauty has still always attraction; beauty
          without youth has none. Clearly the unconscious end which guides us
          here is the possibility of reproduction in general: therefore every
          individual loses attraction for the opposite sex in proportion as
          he or she is removed from the fittest period for begetting or
          conceiving. The second consideration is that of health. Acute
          diseases only temporarily disturb us, chronic diseases or cachexia
          repel us, because they are transmitted to the child. The third
          consideration is the skeleton, because it is the basis of the type
          of the species. Next to age and disease nothing repels us so much
          as a deformed figure; even the most beautiful face cannot atone for
          it; on the contrary, even the ugliest face when accompanied by a
          straight figure is unquestionably preferred. Further, we feel every
          disproportion of the skeleton most strongly; for example, a
          stunted, dumpy, short-boned figure, and many such; also a halting
          gait, where it is not the result of an extraneous accident. On the
          other hand, a strikingly beautiful figure can make up for all
          defects: it enchants us. Here also comes in the great value which
          all attach to the smallness of the feet: it depends upon the fact
          that they are an essential characteristic of the species, for no
          animal has the tarsus and the metatarsus taken together so small as
          man, which accords with his upright walk; he is a plantigrade.
          Accordingly Jesus Sirach also says (xxvi. 23, according to the
          revised translation by Kraus): <span class="tei tei-q">“A woman
          with a straight figure and beautiful feet is like columns of gold
          in sockets of silver.”</span> The teeth also are important; because
          they are essential for nourishment and quite specially hereditary.
          The fourth consideration is a certain fulness of flesh; thus a
          predominance of the vegetative function, of plasticity; because
          this promises abundant nourishment for the fœtus; hence great
          leanness repels us in a striking degree. A full female bosom exerts
          an exceptional charm upon the male sex; because, standing in direct
          connection with <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page353">[pg
          353]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg353"></a>
          the female functions of propagation, it promises abundant
          nourishment to the new-born child. On the other hand, excessively
          fat women excite our disgust: the cause is that this indicates
          atrophy of the uterus, thus barrenness; which is not known by the
          head, but by instinct. The last consideration of all is the beauty
          of the face. Here also before everything else the bones are
          considered; therefore we look principally for a beautiful nose, and
          a short turned-up nose spoils everything. A slight inclination of
          the nose downwards or upwards has decided the happiness in life of
          innumerable maidens, and rightly so, for it concerns the type of
          the species. A small mouth, by means of small maxillæ, is very
          essential as specifically characteristic of the human countenance,
          as distinguished from the muzzle of the brutes. A receding or, as
          it were, cut-away chin is especially disagreeable, because
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">mentum prominulum</span></span> is an
          exclusive characteristic of our species. Finally comes the regard
          for beautiful eyes and forehead; it is connected with the psychical
          qualities, especially the intellectual which are inherited from the
          mother.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The unconscious
          considerations which, on the other hand, the inclination of women
          follows naturally cannot be so exactly assigned. In general the
          following may be asserted: They give the preference to the age from
          thirty to thirty-five years, especially over that of youths who yet
          really present the height of human beauty. The reason is that they
          are not guided by taste but by instinct, which recognises in the
          age named the acme of reproductive power. In general they look less
          to beauty, especially of the face. It is as if they took it upon
          themselves alone to impart this to the child. They are principally
          won by the strength of the man, and the courage which is connected
          with this; for these promise the production of stronger children,
          and also a brave protector for them. Every physical defect of the
          man, every divergence from the type, may with regard to the child
          be removed by the woman in reproduction, through the fact that she
          herself <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page354">[pg
          354]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg354"></a>
          is blameless in these respects, or even exceeds in the opposite
          direction. Only those qualities of the man have to be excepted
          which are peculiar to his sex, and which therefore the mother
          cannot give to the child: such are the manly structure of the
          skeleton, broad shoulders, slender hips, straight bones, muscular
          power, courage, beard, &amp;c. Hence it arises that women often
          love ugly men, but never an unmanly man, because they cannot
          neutralise his defects.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The second class
          of the considerations which lie at the foundation of sexual love
          are those which regard psychical qualities. Here we shall find that
          the woman is throughout attracted by the qualities of the heart or
          character in the man, as those which are inherited from the father.
          The woman is won especially by firmness of will, decision, and
          courage, and perhaps also by honesty and good-heartedness. On the
          other hand, intellectual gifts exercise no direct and instinctive
          power over her, just because they are not inherited from the
          father. Want of understanding does a man no harm with women; indeed
          extraordinary mental endowment, or even genius, might sooner
          influence them unfavourably as an abnormity. Hence one often sees
          an ugly, stupid, and coarse fellow get the better of a cultured,
          able, and amiable man with women. Also marriages from love are
          sometimes consummated between natures which are mentally very
          different: for example, the man is rough, powerful, and stupid; the
          woman tenderly sensitive, delicately thoughtful, cultured,
          æsthetic, &amp;c.; or the man is a genius and learned, the woman a
          goose:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The reason is,
          that here quite other considerations than the intellectual
          predominate,—those of instinct. In marriage what is looked to is
          not intellectual entertainment, but the production of children: it
          is a bond of the heart, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page355">[pg
          355]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg355"></a>
          not of the head. It is a vain and absurd pretence when women assert
          that they have fallen in love with the mind of a man, or else it is
          the over-straining of a degenerate nature. Men, on the other hand,
          are not determined in their instinctive love by the qualities of
          character of the woman; hence so many Socrateses have found their
          Xantippes; for example, Shakspeare, Albrecht Dürer, Byron, &amp;c.
          The intellectual qualities, however, certainly influence here,
          because they are inherited from the mother. Yet their influence is
          easily outweighed by that of physical beauty, which acts directly,
          as concerning a more essential point. However, it happens, either
          from the feeling or the experience of that influence, that mothers
          have their daughters taught the fine arts, languages, and so forth
          in order to make them attractive to men, whereby they wish to
          assist the intellect by artificial means, just as, in case of need,
          they assist the hips and the bosom. Observe that here we are
          speaking throughout only of that entirely immediate instinctive
          attraction from which alone love properly so called grows. That a
          woman of culture and understanding prizes understanding and
          intellect in a man, that a man from rational reflection should test
          and have regard to the character of his bride, has nothing to do
          with the matter with which we are dealing here. Such things lie at
          the bottom of a rational choice in marriage, but not of the
          passionate love, which is our theme.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hitherto I have
          only taken account of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">absolute</span></em> considerations,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, those which hold good for
          every one: I come now to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">relative</span></em> considerations, which are
          individual, because in their case what is looked to is the
          rectification of the type of the species, which is already
          defectively presented, the correction of the divergences from it
          which the chooser's own person already bears in itself, and thus
          the return to the pure presentation of the type. Here, then, each
          one loves what he lacks. Starting from the individual constitution,
          and directed to the individual constitution, the choice which rests
          upon <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page356">[pg 356]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg356"></a> such relative
          considerations is much more definite, decided, and exclusive than
          that which proceeds merely from the absolute considerations;
          therefore the source of really passionate love will lie, as a rule,
          in these relative considerations, and only that of the ordinary and
          slighter inclination in the absolute considerations. Accordingly it
          is not generally precisely correct and perfect beauties that kindle
          great passions. For such a truly passionate inclination to arise
          something is required which can only be expressed by a chemical
          metaphor: two persons must neutralise each other, like acid and
          alkali, to a neutral salt. The essential conditions demanded for
          this are the following. First: all sex is one-sided. This
          one-sidedness is more distinctly expressed in one individual than
          in another; therefore in every individual it can be better
          supplemented and neutralised by one than by another individual of
          the opposite sex, for each one requires a one-sidedness which is
          the opposite of his own to complete the type of humanity in the new
          individual that is to be produced, the constitution of which is
          always the goal towards which all tends. Physiologists know that
          manhood and womanhood admit of innumerable degrees, through which
          the former sinks to the repulsive gynander and hypospadæus, and the
          latter rises to the graceful androgyne; from both sides complete
          hermaphrodism can be reached, at which point stand those
          individuals who, holding the exact mean between the two sexes, can
          be attributed to neither, and consequently are unfit to propagate
          the species. Accordingly, the neutralisation of two individualities
          by each other, of which we are speaking, demands that the definite
          degree of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">his</span></em> manhood shall exactly
          correspond to the definite degree of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">her</span></em>
          womanhood; so that the one-sidedness of each exactly annuls that of
          the other. Accordingly, the most manly man will seek the most
          womanly woman, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vice versâ</span></span>, and in the same way
          every individual will seek another corresponding to him or her in
          degree of sex. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page357">[pg
          357]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg357"></a>
          Now how far the required relation exists between two individuals is
          instinctively felt by them, and, together with the other relative
          considerations, lies at the foundation of the higher degrees of
          love. While, therefore, the lovers speak pathetically of the
          harmony of their souls, the heart of the matter is for the most
          part the agreement or suitableness pointed out here with reference
          to the being which is to be produced and its perfection, and which
          is also clearly of much more importance than the harmony of their
          souls, which often, not long after the marriage, resolves itself
          into a howling discord. Now, here come in the further relative
          considerations, which depend upon the fact that every one
          endeavours to neutralise by means of the other his weaknesses,
          defects, and deviations from the type, so that they will not
          perpetuate themselves, or even develop into complete abnormities in
          the child which is to be produced. The weaker a man is as regards
          muscular power the more will he seek for strong women; and the
          woman on her side will do the same. But since now a less degree of
          muscular power is natural and regular in the woman, women as a rule
          will give the preference to strong men. Further, the size is an
          important consideration. Little men have a decided inclination for
          big women, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vice versâ</span></span>; and indeed in a
          little man the preference for big women will be so much the more
          passionate if he himself was begotten by a big father, and only
          remains little through the influence of his mother; because he has
          inherited from his father the vascular system and its energy, which
          was able to supply a large body with blood. If, on the other hand,
          his father and grandfather were both little, that inclination will
          make itself less felt. At the foundation of the aversion of a big
          woman to big men lies the intention of nature to avoid too big a
          race, if with the strength which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em>
          woman could impart to them they would be too weak to live long. If,
          however, such a woman selects a big husband, perhaps for the sake
          of being more presentable in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page358">[pg 358]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg358"></a> society, then, as a rule, her offspring will
          have to atone for her folly. Further, the consideration as to the
          complexion is very decided. Blondes prefer dark persons, or
          brunettes; but the latter seldom prefer the former. The reason is,
          that fair hair and blue eyes are in themselves a variation from the
          type, almost an abnormity, analogous to white mice, or at least to
          grey horses. In no part of the world, not even in the vicinity of
          the pole, are they indigenous, except in Europe, and are clearly of
          Scandinavian origin. I may here express my opinion in passing that
          the white colour of the skin is not natural to man, but that by
          nature he has a black or brown skin, like our forefathers the
          Hindus; that consequently a white man has never originally sprung
          from the womb of nature, and that thus there is no such thing as a
          white race, much as this is talked of, but every white man is a
          faded or bleached one. Forced into the strange world, where he only
          exists like an exotic plant, and like this requires in winter the
          hothouse, in the course of thousands of years man became white. The
          gipsies, an Indian race which immigrated only about four centuries
          ago, show the transition from the complexion of the Hindu to our
          own.<a href="#note_38" id="noteref_38" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">38</span></span></a>
          Therefore in sexual love nature strives to return to dark hair and
          brown eyes as the primitive type; but the white colour of the skin
          has become a second nature, though not so that the brown of the
          Hindu repels us. Finally, each one also seeks in the particular
          parts of the body the corrective of his own defects and
          aberrations, and does so the more decidedly the more important the
          part is. Therefore snub-nosed individuals have an inexpressible
          liking for hook-noses, parrot-faces; and it is the same with regard
          to all other parts. Men with excessively slim, long bodies and
          limbs can find beauty in a body which is even beyond measure stumpy
          and short. The considerations with regard to temperament act in an
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page359">[pg 359]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg359"></a> analogous manner.
          Each will prefer the temperament opposed to his own; yet only in
          proportion as his one is decided. Whoever is himself in some
          respect very perfect does not indeed seek and love imperfection in
          this respect, but is yet more easily reconciled to it than others;
          because he himself insures the children against great imperfection
          of this part. For example, whoever is himself very white will not
          object to a yellow complexion; but whoever has the latter will find
          dazzling whiteness divinely beautiful. The rare case in which a man
          falls in love with a decidedly ugly woman occurs when, besides the
          exact harmony of the degree of sex explained above, the whole of
          her abnormities are precisely the opposite, and thus the
          corrective, of his. The love is then wont to reach a high
          degree.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The profound
          seriousness with which we consider and ponder each bodily part of
          the woman, and she on her part does the same, the critical
          scrupulosity with which we inspect a woman who begins to please us,
          the capriciousness of our choice, the keen attention with which the
          bridegroom observes his betrothed, his carefulness not to be
          deceived in any part, and the great value which he attaches to
          every excess or defect in the essential parts, all this is quite in
          keeping with the importance of the end. For the new being to be
          produced will have to bear through its whole life a similar part.
          For example, if the woman is only a little crooked, this may easily
          impart to her son a hump, and so in all the rest. Consciousness of
          all this certainly does not exist. On the contrary, every one
          imagines that he makes that careful selection in the interest of
          his own pleasure (which at bottom cannot be interested in it at
          all); but he makes it precisely as, under the presupposition of his
          own corporisation, is most in keeping with the interest of the
          species, to maintain the type of which as pure as possible is the
          secret task. The individual acts here, without knowing it, by order
          of something higher than itself, the species; hence <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page360">[pg 360]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg360"></a> the importance which it attaches to
          things which may and indeed must be, indifferent to itself as such.
          There is something quite peculiar in the profound unconscious
          seriousness with which two young persons of opposite sex who see
          each other for the first time regard each other, in the searching
          and penetrating glance they cast at one another, in the careful
          review which all the features and parts of their respective persons
          have to endure. This investigating and examining is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">meditation of the
          genius of the species</span></em> on the individual which is
          possible through these two and the combination of its qualities.
          According to the result of this meditation is the degree of their
          pleasure in each other and their yearning for each other. This
          yearning, even after it has attained a considerable degree, may be
          suddenly extinguished again by the discovery of something that had
          previously remained unobserved. In this way, then, the genius of
          the species meditates concerning the coming race in all who are
          capable of reproduction. The nature of this race is the great work
          with which Cupid is occupied, unceasingly active, speculating, and
          pondering. In comparison with the importance of his great affair,
          which concerns the species and all coming races, the affairs of
          individuals in their whole ephemeral totality are very trifling;
          therefore he is always ready to sacrifice these regardlessly. For
          he is related to them as an immortal to mortals, and his interests
          to theirs as infinite to finite. Thus, in the consciousness of
          managing affairs of a higher kind than all those which only concern
          individual weal or woe, he carries them on sublimely, undisturbed
          in the midst of the tumult of war, or in the bustle of business
          life, or during the raging of a plague, and pursues them even into
          the seclusion of the cloister.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have seen in
          the above that the intensity of love increases with its
          individualisation, because we have shown that the physical
          qualities of two individuals can be such that, for the purpose of
          restoring as far as possible <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page361">[pg 361]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg361"></a> the type of the species, the one is quite
          specially and perfectly the completion or supplement of the other,
          which therefore desires it exclusively. Already in this case a
          considerable passion arises, which at once gains a nobler and more
          sublime appearance from the fact that it is directed to an
          individual object, and to it alone; thus, as it were, arises at the
          special order of the species. For the opposite reason, the mere
          sexual impulse is ignoble, because without individualisation it is
          directed to all, and strives to maintain the species only as
          regards quantity, with little respect to quality. But the
          individualising, and with it the intensity of the love, can reach
          so high a degree that without its satisfaction all the good things
          in the world, and even life itself, lose their value. It is then a
          wish which attains a vehemence that no other wish ever reaches, and
          therefore makes one ready for any sacrifice, and in case its
          fulfilment remains unalterably denied, may lead to madness or
          suicide. At the foundation of such an excessive passion there must
          lie, besides the considerations we have shown above, still others
          which we have not thus before our eyes. We must therefore assume
          that here not only the corporisation, but the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em> of
          the man and the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intellect</span></em> of the woman are
          specially suitable to each other, in consequence of which a
          perfectly definite individual can be produced by them alone, whose
          existence the genius of the species has here in view, for reasons
          which are inaccessible to us, since they lie in the nature of the
          thing in itself. Or, to speak more exactly, the will to live
          desires here to objectify itself in a perfectly definite
          individual, which can only be produced by this father with this
          mother. This metaphysical desire of the will in itself has
          primarily no other sphere of action in the series of existences
          than the hearts of the future parents, which accordingly are seized
          with this ardent longing, and now imagine themselves to desire on
          their own account what really for the present has only a purely
          metaphysical end, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, an end which lies outside
          the series of actually existing <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page362">[pg 362]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg362"></a> things. Thus it is the ardent longing to
          enter existence of the future individual which has first become
          possible here, a longing which proceeds from the primary source of
          all being, and exhibits itself in the phenomenal world as the lofty
          passion of the future parents for each other, paying little regard
          to all that is outside itself; in fact, as an unparalleled
          illusion, on account of which such a lover would give up all the
          good things of this world to enjoy the possession of this woman,
          who yet can really give him nothing more than any other. That yet
          it is just this possession that is kept in view here is seen from
          the fact that even this lofty passion, like all others, is
          extinguished in its enjoyment—to the great astonishment of those
          who are possessed by it. It also becomes extinct when, through the
          woman turning out barren (which, according to Hufeland, may arise
          from nineteen accidental constitutional defects), the real
          metaphysical end is frustrated; just as daily happens in millions
          of germs trampled under foot, in which yet the same metaphysical
          life principle strives for existence; for which there is no other
          consolation than that an infinity of space, time, and matter, and
          consequently inexhaustible opportunity for return, stands open to
          the will to live.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The view which
          is here expounded must once have been present to the mind of
          Theophrastus Paracelsus, even if only in a fleeting form, though he
          has not handled this subject, and my whole system of thought was
          foreign to him; for, in quite a different context and in his
          desultory manner, he wrote the following remarkable words:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Hi sunt, quos Deus
          copulavit, ut eam, quæ fuit Uriæ et David; quamvis ex diametro (sic

          pugnaret hoc.... sed propter Salomonem</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">qui aliunde

          (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De vita
          longa</span></span>, i. 5).</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The longing of
          love, the ἱμερος, which the poets of all ages are unceasingly
          occupied with expressing in innumerable <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page363">[pg 363]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg363"></a> forms, and do not exhaust the subject, nay,
          cannot do it justice, this longing, which attaches the idea of
          endless happiness to the possession of a particular woman, and
          unutterable pain to the thought that this possession cannot be
          attained,—this longing and this pain cannot obtain their material
          from the wants of an ephemeral individual; but they are the sighs
          of the spirit of the species, which sees here, to be won or lost, a
          means for the attainment of its ends which cannot be replaced, and
          therefore groans deeply. The species alone has infinite life, and
          therefore is capable of infinite desires, infinite satisfaction,
          and infinite pain. But these are here imprisoned in the narrow
          breast of a mortal. No wonder, then, if such a breast seems like to
          burst, and can find no expression for the intimations of infinite
          rapture or infinite misery with which it is filled. This, then,
          affords the materials for all erotic poetry of a sublime kind,
          which accordingly rises into transcendent metaphors, soaring above
          all that is earthly. This is the theme of Petrarch, the material
          for the St. Preuxs, Werthers, and Jacopo Ortis, who apart from it
          could not be understood nor explained. For that infinite esteem for
          the loved one cannot rest upon some spiritual excellences, or in
          general upon any objective, real qualities of hers; for one thing,
          because she is often not sufficiently well known to the lover, as
          was the case with Petrarch. The spirit of the species alone can see
          at one glance what <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">worth</span></em> she has for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">it</span></em>, for
          its ends. And great passions also arise, as a rule, at the first
          glance:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this regard a
          passage in the romance of <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Guzman de
          Alfarache</span></span>,”</span> by Mateo Aleman, which has been
          famous for 250 years, is remarkable: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="es"><span style="font-style: italic">No es necessario, para que
          uno ame, que pase distancia de tiempo, que siga discurso, ni haga

          acá</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page364">[pg

          necessary that much time should pass, that he should set about
          reflecting and make a choice; but only that at that first and only
          glance a certain correspondence and consonance should be
          encountered on both sides, or that which in common life we are wont
          to call a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sympathy of the blood</span></em>, and to
          which a special influence of the stars generally impels), P. ii.
          lib. iii. c. 5. Accordingly the loss of the loved one, through a
          rival, or through death, is also for the passionate lover a pain
          that surpasses all others, just because it is of a transcendental
          kind, since it affects him not merely as an individual, but attacks
          him in his <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">essentia
          æterna</span></span>, in the life of the species into whose special
          will and service he was here called. Hence jealousy is such torment
          and so grim, and the surrender of the loved one is the greatest of
          all sacrifices. A hero is ashamed of all lamentations except the
          lamentation of love, because in this it is not he but the species
          that laments. In Calderon's <span class="tei tei-q">“Zenobia the
          Great”</span> there is in the first act a scene between Zenobia and
          Decius in which the latter says:</p>

</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here, honour,
          which hitherto outweighed every interest, is beaten out of the
          field as soon as sexual love, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the interest of the
          species, comes into play, and sees before it a decided advantage;
          for this is infinitely superior to every interest of mere
          individuals, however important it may be. Therefore to this alone
          honour, duty, and fidelity yield after they have withstood every
          other temptation, including the threat of death. In the same way we
          find in private life that conscientiousness is in no point so rare
          as in this: it is here sometimes set aside even by <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page365">[pg 365]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg365"></a> persons who are otherwise honest and
          just, and adultery is recklessly committed when passionate love,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the interest of the
          species, has mastered them. It even seems as if in this they
          believed themselves to be conscious of a higher right than the
          interests of individuals can ever confer; just because they act in
          the interest of the species. In this reference Chamfort's remark is
          worth noticing: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">Quand un homme et une femme ont l'un pour
          l'autre une passion violente, il me semble toujours que quelque
          soient les obstacles qui les séparent, un mari, des parens, etc.,
          les deux amans sont l'un a l'autre, de par la Nature, qu'ils
          s'appartiennent de droit divin, malgré les lois et les conventions
          humaines</span></span>.”</span> Whoever is inclined to be incensed
          at this should be referred to the remarkable indulgence which the
          Saviour shows in the Gospel to the woman taken in adultery, in that
          He also assumes the same guilt in the case of all present. From
          this point of view the greater part of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Decameron”</span> appears as mere mocking and jeering
          of the genius of the species at the rights and interests of
          individuals which it tramples under foot. Differences of rank and
          all similar circumstances, when they oppose the union of passionate
          lovers, are set aside with the same ease and treated as nothing by
          the genius of the species, which, pursuing its ends that concern
          innumerable generations, blows off as spray such human laws and
          scruples. From the same deep-lying grounds, when the ends of
          passionate love are concerned, every danger is willingly
          encountered, and those who are otherwise timorous here become
          courageous. In plays and novels also we see, with ready sympathy,
          the young persons who are fighting the battle of their love,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the interest of the
          species, gain the victory over their elders, who are thinking only
          of the welfare of the individuals. For the efforts of the lovers
          appear to us as much more important, sublime, and therefore right,
          than anything that can be opposed to them, as the species is more
          important than the individual. Accordingly the fundamental theme of
          almost all <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page366">[pg
          366]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg366"></a>
          comedies is the appearance of the genius of the species with its
          aims, which are opposed to the personal interest of the individuals
          presented, and therefore threaten to undermine their happiness. As
          a rule it attains its end, which, as in accordance with poetical
          justice, satisfies the spectator, because he feels that the aims of
          the species are much to be preferred to those of the individual.
          Therefore at the conclusion he leaves the victorious lovers quite
          confidently, because he shares with them the illusion that they
          have founded their own happiness, while they have rather sacrificed
          it to the choice of the species, against the will and foresight of
          their elders. It has been attempted in single, abnormal comedies to
          reverse the matter and bring about the happiness of the individuals
          at the cost of the aims of the species; but then the spectator
          feels the pain which the genius of the species suffers, and is not
          consoled by the advantages which are thereby assured to the
          individuals. As examples of this kind two very well-known little
          pieces occur to me: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">La reine de 16
          ans</span></span>,”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Le marriage de raison</span></span>.”</span>
          In tragedies containing love affairs, since the aims of the species
          are frustrated, the lovers who were its tools, generally perish
          also; for example, in <span class="tei tei-q">“Romeo and
          Juliet,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Tancred,”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Don Carlos,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Wallenstein,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“The
          Bride of Messina,”</span> and many others.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The love of a
          man often affords comical, and sometimes also tragical phenomena;
          both because, taken possession of by the spirit of the species, he
          is now ruled by this, and no longer belongs to himself: his conduct
          thereby becomes unsuited to the individual. That which in the
          higher grades of love imparts such a tinge of poetry and
          sublimeness to his thoughts, which gives them even a transcendental
          and hyperphysical tendency, on account of which he seems to lose
          sight altogether of his real, very physical aim, is at bottom this,
          that he is now inspired by the spirit of the species whose affairs
          are infinitely more important than all those which concern mere
          individuals, in order to find <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page367">[pg 367]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg367"></a> under the special directions of this spirit
          the whole existence of an indefinitely long posterity with this
          individual and exactly determined nature, which it can receive only
          from him as father and the woman he loves as mother, and which
          otherwise could never, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as such</span></em>, attain to existence,
          while the objectification of the will to live expressly demands
          this existence. It is the feeling that he is acting in affairs of
          such transcendent importance which raises the lover so high above
          everything earthly, nay, even above himself, and gives such a
          hyperphysical clothing to his very physical desires, that love
          becomes a poetical episode even in the life of the most prosaic
          man; in which last case the matter sometimes assumes a comical
          aspect. That mandate of the will which objectifies itself in the
          species exhibits itself in the consciousness of the lover under the
          mask of the anticipation of an infinite blessedness which is to be
          found for him in the union with this female individual. Now, in the
          highest grades of love this chimera becomes so radiant that if it
          cannot be attained life itself loses all charm, and now appears so
          joyless, hollow, and insupportable that the disgust at it even
          overcomes the fear of death, so that it is then sometimes
          voluntarily cut short. The will of such a man has been caught in
          the vortex of the will of the species, or this has obtained such a
          great predominance over the individual will that if such a man
          cannot be effective in the first capacity, he disdains to be so in
          the last. The individual is here too weak a vessel to be capable of
          enduring the infinite longing of the will of the species
          concentrated upon a definite object. In this case, therefore, the
          issue is suicide, sometimes the double suicide of the two lovers;
          unless, to save life, nature allows madness to intervene, which
          then covers with its veil the consciousness of that hopeless state.
          No year passes without proving the reality of what has been
          expounded by several cases of all these kinds.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Not only,
          however, has the unsatisfied passion of love <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page368">[pg 368]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg368"></a> sometimes a tragic issue, but the
          satisfied passion also leads oftener to unhappiness than to
          happiness. For its demands often conflict so much with the personal
          welfare of him who is concerned that they undermine it, because
          they are incompatible with his other circumstances, and disturb the
          plan of life built upon them. Nay, not only with external
          circumstances is love often in contradiction, but even with the
          lover's own individuality, for it flings itself upon persons who,
          apart from the sexual relation, would be hateful, contemptible, and
          even abhorrent to the lover. But so much more powerful is the will
          of the species than that of the individual that the lover shuts his
          eyes to all those qualities which are repellent to him, overlooks
          all, ignores all, and binds himself for ever to the object of his
          passion—so entirely is he blinded by that illusion, which vanishes
          as soon as the will of the species is satisfied, and leaves behind
          a detested companion for life. Only from this can it be explained
          that we often see very reasonable and excellent men bound to
          termagants and she-devils, and cannot conceive how they could have
          made such a choice. On this account the ancients represented love
          as blind. Indeed, a lover may even know distinctly and feel
          bitterly the faults of temperament and character of his bride,
          which promise him a miserable life, and yet not be frightened
          away:—</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For ultimately
          he seeks not his own things, but those of a third person, who has
          yet to come into being, although he is involved in the illusion
          that what he seeks is his own affair. But it is just this not
          seeking of one's own things which is everywhere the stamp of
          greatness, that gives to passionate love also a touch of sublimity,
          and makes it a worthy subject of poetry. Finally, sexual love is
          compatible even with the extremest hatred towards its object:
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page369">[pg 369]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg369"></a> therefore Plato has
          compared it to the love of the wolf for the sheep. This case
          appears when a passionate lover, in spite of all efforts and
          entreaties, cannot obtain a favourable hearing on any
          condition:—</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The hatred of
          the loved one which then is kindled sometimes goes so far that the
          lover murders her, and then himself. One or two examples of this
          generally happen every year; they will be found in the newspapers.
          Therefore Goethe's lines are quite correct:—</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is really no
          hyperbole if a lover describes the coldness of his beloved and the
          delight of her vanity, which feeds on his sufferings, as cruelty;
          for he is under the influence of an impulse which, akin to the
          instinct of insects, compels him, in spite of all grounds of
          reason, to pursue his end unconditionally, and to undervalue
          everything else: he cannot give it up. Not one but many a Petrarch
          has there been who was compelled to drag through life the
          unsatisfied ardour of love, like a fetter, an iron weight at his
          foot, and breathe his sighs in lonely woods; but only in the one
          Petrarch dwelt also the gift of poetry; so that Goethe's beautiful
          lines hold good of him:—</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In fact, the
          genius of the species wages war throughout with the guardian
          geniuses of individuals, is their pursuer and enemy, always ready
          relentlessly to destroy personal happiness in order to carry out
          its ends; nay, the welfare of whole nations has sometimes been
          sacrificed to its humours. An example of this is given us by
          Shakspeare in <span class="tei tei-q">“Henry VI.,”</span> pt. iii.,
          act 3, sc. 2 and 3. All this depends upon <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page370">[pg 370]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg370"></a> the fact that the species, as that in which
          the root of our being lies, has a closer and earlier right to us
          than the individual; hence its affairs take precedence. From the
          feeling of this the ancients personified the genius of the species
          in Cupid, a malevolent, cruel, and therefore ill-reputed god, in
          spite of his childish appearance; a capricious, despotic demon, but
          yet lord of gods and men:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A deadly shot,
          blindness, and wings are his attributes. The latter signify
          inconstancy; and this appears, as a rule, only with the disillusion
          which is the consequence of satisfaction.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Because the
          passion depended upon an illusion, which represented that which has
          only value for the species as valuable for the individual, the
          deception must vanish after the attainment of the end of the
          species. The spirit of the species which took possession of the
          individual sets it free again. Forsaken by this spirit, the
          individual falls back into its original limitation and narrowness,
          and sees with wonder that after such a high, heroic, and infinite
          effort nothing has resulted for its pleasure but what every sexual
          gratification affords. Contrary to expectation, it finds itself no
          happier than before. It observes that it has been the dupe of the
          will of the species. Therefore, as a rule, a Theseus who has been
          made happy will forsake his Ariadne. If Petrarch's passion had been
          satisfied, his song would have been silenced from that time forth,
          like that of the bird as soon as the eggs are laid.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here let me
          remark in passing that however much my metaphysics of love will
          displease the very persons who are entangled in this passion, yet
          if rational considerations in general could avail anything against
          it, the fundamental truth disclosed by me would necessarily fit one
          more than anything else to subdue it. But the saying of the old
          comedian will, no doubt, remain true: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Quæ res in se</span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page371">[pg 371]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg371"></a><span style="font-style: italic">neque consilium, neque modum habet ullum, eam
          consilio regere non potes.</span></span>”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Marriages from
          love are made in the interest of the species, not of the
          individuals. Certainly the persons concerned imagine they are
          advancing their own happiness; but their real end is one which is
          foreign to themselves, for it lies in the production of an
          individual which is only possible through them. Brought together by
          this aim, they ought henceforth to try to get on together as well
          as possible. But very often the pair brought together by that
          instinctive illusion, which is the essence of passionate love,
          will, in other respects, be of very different natures. This comes
          to light when the illusion vanishes, as it necessarily must.
          Accordingly love marriages, as a rule, turn out unhappy; for
          through them the coming generation is cared for at the expense of
          the present. <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="es"><span style="font-style: italic">Quien se casa por amores, ha de vivir con
          dolores</span></span>”</span> (Who marries from love must live in
          sorrow), says the Spanish proverb. The opposite is the case with
          marriages contracted for purposes of convenience, generally in
          accordance with the choice of the parents. The considerations
          prevailing here, of whatever kind they may be, are at least real,
          and cannot vanish of themselves. Through them, however, the
          happiness of the present generation is certainly cared for, to the
          disadvantage of the coming generation, and notwithstanding this it
          remains problematical. The man who in his marriage looks to money
          more than to the satisfaction of his inclination lives more in the
          individual than in the species; which is directly opposed to the
          truth; hence it appears unnatural, and excites a certain contempt.
          A girl who, against the advice of her parents, rejects the offer of
          a rich and not yet old man, in order, setting aside all
          considerations of convenience, to choose according to her
          instinctive inclination alone, sacrifices her individual welfare to
          the species. But just on this account one cannot withhold from her
          a certain approbation; for she has preferred what is of most
          importance, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page372">[pg
          372]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg372"></a>
          and has acted in the spirit of nature (more exactly, of the
          species), while the parents advised in the spirit of individual
          egoism. In accordance with all this, it appears as if in making a
          marriage either the individual or the interests of the species must
          come off a loser. And this is generally the case; for that
          convenience and passionate love should go hand in hand is the
          rarest of lucky accidents. The physical, moral, or intellectual
          deficiency of the nature of most men may to some extent have its
          ground in the fact that marriages are ordinarily entered into not
          from pure choice and inclination, but from all kinds of external
          considerations, and on account of accidental circumstances. If,
          however, besides convenience, inclination is also to a certain
          extent regarded, this is, as it were, an agreement with the genius
          of the species. Happy marriages are well known to be rare; just
          because it lies in the nature of marriage that its chief end is not
          the present but the coming generation. However, let me add, for the
          consolation of tender, loving natures, that sometimes passionate
          sexual love associates itself with a feeling of an entirely
          different origin—real friendship based upon agreement of
          disposition, which yet for the most part only appears when sexual
          love proper is extinguished in its satisfaction. This friendship
          will then generally spring from the fact that the supplementing and
          corresponding physical, moral, and intellectual qualities of the
          two individuals, from which sexual love arose, with reference to
          the child to be produced, are, with reference also to the
          individuals themselves, related to each other in a supplementary
          manner as opposite qualities of temperament and mental gifts, and
          thereby form the basis of a harmony of disposition.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The whole
          metaphysics of love here dealt with stands in close connection with
          my metaphysics in general, and the light which it throws upon this
          may be summed up as follows.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have seen
          that the careful selection for the satisfaction of the sexual
          impulse, a selection which rises through <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page373">[pg 373]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg373"></a> innumerable degrees up to that of passionate
          love, depends upon the highly serious interest which man takes in
          the special personal constitution of the next generation. Now this
          exceedingly remarkable interest confirms two truths which have been
          set forth in the preceding chapters. (1.) The indestructibility of
          the true nature of man, which lives on in that coming generation.
          For that interest which is so lively and eager, and does not spring
          from reflection and intention, but from the inmost characteristics
          and tendencies of our nature, could not be so indelibly present and
          exercise such great power over man if he were absolutely
          perishable, and were merely followed in time by a race actually and
          entirely different from him. (2.) That his true nature lies more in
          the species than in the individual. For that interest in the
          special nature of the species, which is the root of all love, from
          the passing inclination to the serious passion, is for every one
          really the highest concern, the success or failure of which touches
          him most sensibly; therefore it is called <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">par
          excellence</span></span> the affair of the heart. Moreover, when
          this interest has expressed itself strongly and decidedly,
          everything which merely concerns one's own person is postponed and
          necessarily sacrificed to it. Through this, then, man shows that
          the species lies closer to him than the individual, and he lives
          more immediately in the former than in the latter. Why does the
          lover hang with complete abandonment on the eyes of his chosen one,
          and is ready to make every sacrifice for her? Because it is his
          immortal part that longs after her; while it is only his mortal
          part that desires everything else. That vehement or intense longing
          directed to a particular woman is accordingly an immediate pledge
          of the indestructibility of the kernel of our being, and of its
          continued existence in the species. But to regard this continued
          existence as something trifling and insufficient is an error which
          arises from the fact that under the conception of the continued
          life of the species one thinks nothing more <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page374">[pg 374]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg374"></a> than the future existence of beings
          similar to us, but in no regard identical with us; and this again
          because, starting from knowledge directed towards without, one
          takes into consideration only the external form of the species as
          we apprehend it in perception, and not its inner nature. But it is
          just this inner nature which lies at the foundation of our own
          consciousness as its kernel, and hence indeed is more immediate
          than this itself, and, as thing in itself, free from the
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium individuationis</span></span>, is
          really the same and identical in all individuals, whether they
          exist together or after each other. Now this is the will to live,
          thus just that which desires life and continuance so vehemently.
          This accordingly is spared and unaffected by death. It can attain
          to no better state than its present one; and consequently for it,
          with life, the constant suffering and striving of the individuals
          is certain. To free it from this is reserved for the denial of the
          will to live, as the means by which the individual will breaks away
          from the stem of the species, and surrenders that existence in it.
          We lack conceptions for that which it now is; indeed all data for
          such conceptions are wanting. We can only describe it as that which
          is free to be will to live or not. Buddhism denotes the latter case
          by the word Nirvana, the etymology of which was given in the note
          at the end of chapter 41. It is the point which remains for ever
          unattainable to all human knowledge, just as such.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If now, from the
          standpoint of this last consideration, we contemplate the turmoil
          of life, we behold all occupied with its want and misery, straining
          all their powers to satisfy its infinite needs and to ward off its
          multifarious sorrows, yet without daring to hope anything else than
          simply the preservation of this tormented existence for a short
          span of time. In between, however, in the midst of the tumult, we
          see the glances of two lovers meet longingly: yet why so secretly,
          fearfully, and stealthily? Because these lovers are the traitors
          who seek to perpetuate <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page375">[pg
          375]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg375"></a>
          the whole want and drudgery, which would otherwise speedily reach
          an end; this they wish to frustrate, as others like them have
          frustrated it before. This consideration already passes over into
          the subject of the following chapter.<a href="#note_39" id="noteref_39" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">39</span></span></a></p>

<span style="font-size: 144%">On The Assertion Of The Will To
          Live.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If the will to
          live exhibited itself merely as an impulse to self-preservation,
          this would only be an assertion of the individual phenomenon for
          the span of time of its natural duration. The cares and troubles of
          such a life would not be great, and consequently existence would be
          easy and serene. Since, on the contrary, the will wills life
          absolutely and for all time, it exhibits itself also as sexual
          impulse, which has in view an endless series of generations. This
          impulse does away with that carelessness, serenity, and innocence
          which would accompany a merely individual existence, for it brings
          unrest and melancholy into the consciousness; misfortunes, cares,
          and misery into the course of life. If, on the other hand, it is
          voluntarily suppressed, as we see in rare exceptions, then this is
          the turning of the will, which changes its course. The will does
          not then transcend the individual, but is abolished in it. Yet this
          can only take place by means of the individual doing painful
          violence to itself. If, however, it does take place, then the
          freedom from care and the serenity of the purely individual
          existence is restored to the consciousness, and indeed in a higher
          degree. On the other hand, to the satisfaction of that most
          vehement of all impulses and desires is linked the origin of a new
          existence, thus the carrying out of life anew, with all its
          burdens, cares, wants, and pains; certainly in another individual;
          yet if the two who are different in the phenomenon <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page377">[pg 377]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg377"></a> were so absolutely and in themselves,
          where would then be eternal justice? Life presents itself as a
          problem, a task to be worked out, and therefore, as a rule, as a
          constant conflict with necessity. Accordingly every one tries to
          get through with it and come off as well as he can. He performs
          life as a compulsory service which he owes. But who has contracted
          the debt?—His begetter, in the enjoyment of sensual pleasure. Thus,
          because the one has enjoyed this, the other must live, suffer, and
          die. However, we know and look back here to the fact that the
          difference of the similar is conditioned by space and time, which
          in this sense I have called the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium individuationis</span></span>.
          Otherwise eternal justice could not be vindicated. Paternal love,
          on account of which the father is ready to do, to suffer, and to
          risk more for his child than for himself, and at the same time
          knows that he owes this, depends simply upon the fact that the
          begetter recognises himself in the begotten.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The life of a
          man, with its endless care, want, and suffering, is to be regarded
          as the explanation and paraphrase of the act of procreation,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the decided assertion of
          the will to live; and further, it is also due to this that he owes
          to nature the debt of death, and thinks with anxiety of this debt.
          Is this not evidence of the fact that our existence involves guilt?
          At any rate, we always exist, subject to the periodical payment of
          the toll, birth and death, and successively partake of all the
          sorrows and joys of life, so that none can escape us: this is just
          the fruit of the assertion of the will to live. Thus the fear of
          death, which in spite of all the miseries of life holds us firmly
          to it, is really illusory; but just as illusory is the impulse
          which has enticed us into it. This enticement itself may be seen
          objectively in the reciprocal longing glances of two lovers; they
          are the purest expression of the will to live, in its assertion.
          How soft and tender it is here! It wills well-being, and quiet
          pleasure, and mild joys for itself, for others, for all. It is the
          theme of Anacreon. Thus by <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page378">[pg 378]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg378"></a> allurements and flattery it makes its way
          into life. But when once it is there, misery introduces crime, and
          crime misery; horror and desolation fill the scene. It is the theme
          of Æschylus.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But now the act
          through which the will asserts itself and man arises is one of
          which all are, in their inmost being, ashamed, which they therefore
          carefully conceal; nay, if they are caught in it, are terrified as
          if they had been taken in a crime. It is an action of which in cold
          reflection one generally thinks with dislike, and in a lofty mood
          with loathing. Reflections which in this regard approach the matter
          more closely are offered by Montaigne in the fifth chapter of the
          third book, under the marginal heading: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ce que c'est que
          l'amour</span></span>.”</span> A peculiar sadness and repentance
          follows close upon it, is yet most perceptible after the first
          performance of the act, and in general is the more distinct the
          nobler is the character. Hence even Pliny, the pagan, says:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Homini tantum primi
          coitus pœnitentia, augurium scilicet vitæ, a pœnitenda
          origine</span></span>”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hist.
          Nat.</span></span>, x. 83). And, on the other hand, in Goethe's
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Faust,”</span> what do devil and witches
          practise and sing of on their Sabbath? Lewdness and obscenity. And
          in the same work (in the admirable <span class="tei tei-q">“Paralipomena”</span> to <span class="tei tei-q">“Faust”</span>) what does incarnate Satan preach before
          the assembled multitude? Lewdness and obscenity. But simply and
          solely by means of the continual practice of such an act as this
          does the human race subsist. If now optimism were right, if our
          existence were to be thankfully recognised as the gift of the
          highest goodness guided by wisdom, and accordingly in itself
          praiseworthy, commendable, and agreeable, then certainly the act
          which perpetuates it would necessarily have borne quite another
          physiognomy. If, on the other hand, this existence is a kind of
          false step or error; if it is the work of an originally blind will,
          whose most fortunate development is that it comes to itself in
          order to abolish itself; then the act <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page379">[pg 379]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg379"></a> which perpetuates that existence must appear
          precisely as it does appear.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With reference
          to the first fundamental truth of my doctrine, the remark deserves
          a place here that the shame mentioned above which attaches to the
          act of generation extends even to the parts which are concerned in
          this, although, like all other parts, they are given us by nature.
          This is again a striking proof that not only the actions but even
          the body of man is to be regarded as the manifestation, the
          objectification, of his will, and as its work. For he could not be
          ashamed of a thing which existed without his will.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The act of
          generation is further related to the world, as the answer is
          related to the riddle. The world is wide in space and old in time,
          and of an inexhaustible multiplicity of forms. Yet all this is only
          the manifestation of the will to live; and the concentration, the
          focus of this will is the act of generation. Thus in this act the
          inner nature of the world expresses itself most distinctly. In this
          regard it is indeed worth noticing that this act itself is also
          distinctly called <span class="tei tei-q">“the will”</span> in the
          very significant German phrase, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">Er verlangte von ihr, sie
          sollte ihm zu Willen sein</span></span>”</span> (He desired her to
          comply with his wishes). As the most distinct expression of the
          will, then, this act is the kernel, the compendium, the
          quintessence of the world. Therefore from it we obtain light as to
          the nature and tendency of the world: it is the answer to the
          riddle. Accordingly it is understood under <span class="tei tei-q">“the tree of knowledge,”</span> for after acquaintance
          with it the eyes of every one are opened as to life, as Byron also
          says:</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">

            128.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is not less
          in keeping with this quality that it is the great αρρητον, the open
          secret, which must never and nowhere be distinctly mentioned, but
          always and everywhere is understood as the principal matter, and is
          therefore <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page380">[pg
          380]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg380"></a>
          constantly present to the thoughts of all, wherefore also the
          slightest allusion to it is instantly understood. The leading part
          which that act, and what is connected with it, plays in the world,
          because love intrigues are everywhere, on the one hand, pursued,
          and, on the other hand, assumed, is quite in keeping with the
          importance of this <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">punctum
          saliens</span></span> of the egg of the world. The source of the
          amusing is simply the constant concealment of the chief
          concern.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But see now how
          the young, innocent, human intellect, when that great secret of the
          world first becomes known to it, is startled at the enormity! The
          reason of this is that in the long course which the originally
          unconscious will had to traverse before it rose to intellect,
          especially to human, rational intellect, it became so strange to
          itself that it no longer knows its origin, that <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">pœnitenda origo</span></span>, and now, from
          the standpoint of pure, and therefore innocent, knowing, is
          horrified at it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Since now the
          focus of the will, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, its concentration and
          highest expression, is the sexual impulse and its satisfaction,
          this is very significantly and naïvely expressed in the symbolical
          language of nature through the fact that the individualised will,
          that is, the man and the brute, makes its entrance into the world
          through the door of the sexual organs.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The assertion of
          the will to live, which accordingly has its centre in the act of
          generation, is in the case of the brute infallible. For the will,
          which is the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">natura
          naturans</span></span>, first arrives at reflection in man. To
          arrive at reflection means, not merely to know the momentary
          necessity of the individual will, how to serve it in the pressing
          present—as is the case with the brute, in proportion to its
          completeness and its necessities, which go hand in hand—but to have
          attained a greater breadth of knowledge, by virtue of a distinct
          remembrance of the past, an approximate anticipation of the future,
          and thereby a general survey of the individual life, both one's
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page381">[pg 381]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg381"></a> own life and that of
          others, nay, of existence in general. Really the life of every
          species of brute, through the thousands of years of its existence,
          is to a certain extent like a single moment; for it is mere
          consciousness of the present, without that of the past and the
          future, and consequently without that of death. In this sense it is
          to be regarded as a permanent moment, a <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Nunc stans</span></span>. Here we see, in
          passing, most distinctly that in general the form of life, or the
          manifestation of the will with consciousness, is primarily and
          immediately merely the present. Past and future are added only in
          the case of man, and indeed merely in conception, are known
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">in abstracto</span></span>, and perhaps
          illustrated by pictures of the imagination. Thus after the will to
          live, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the inner being of nature,
          in the ceaseless striving towards complete objectification and
          complete enjoyment, has run through the whole series of the
          brutes,—which often occurs in the various periods of successive
          animal series each arising anew on the same planet,—it arrives at
          last at reflection in the being who is endowed with reason, man.
          Here now to him the thing begins to be doubtful, the question
          forces itself upon him whence and wherefore all this is, and
          chiefly whether the care and misery of his life and effort is
          really repaid by the gain? <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">Le jeu vaut-il bien la
          chandelle?</span></span>”</span> Accordingly here is the point at
          which, in the light of distinct knowledge, he decides for the
          assertion or denial of the will to live; although as a rule he can
          only bring the latter to consciousness in a mythical form. We have
          consequently no ground for assuming that a still more highly
          developed objectification of the will is ever reached, anywhere;
          for it has already reached its turning-point here.</p>

<span style="font-size: 144%">On The Vanity And Suffering Of
          Life.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Awakened to life
          out of the night of unconsciousness, the will finds itself an
          individual, in an endless and boundless world, among innumerable
          individuals, all striving, suffering, erring; and as if through a
          troubled dream it hurries back to its old unconsciousness. Yet till
          then its desires are limitless, its claims inexhaustible, and every
          satisfied desire gives rise to a new one. No possible satisfaction
          in the world could suffice to still its longings, set a goal to its
          infinite cravings, and fill the bottomless abyss of its heart. Then
          let one consider what as a rule are the satisfactions of any kind
          that a man obtains. For the most part nothing more than the bare
          maintenance of this existence itself, extorted day by day with
          unceasing trouble and constant care in the conflict with want, and
          with death in prospect. Everything in life shows that earthly
          happiness is destined to be frustrated or recognised as an
          illusion. The grounds of this lie deep in the nature of things.
          Accordingly the life of most men is troubled and short. Those who
          are comparatively happy are so, for the most part, only apparently,
          or else, like men of long life, they are the rare exceptions, a
          possibility of which there had to be,—as decoy-birds. Life presents
          itself as a continual deception in small things as in great. If it
          has promised, it does not keep its word, unless to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page383">[pg 383]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg383"></a> show how little worth desiring were the
          things desired: thus we are deluded now by hope, now by what was
          hoped for. If it has given, it did so in order to take. The
          enchantment of distance shows us paradises which vanish like
          optical illusions when we have allowed ourselves to be mocked by
          them. Happiness accordingly always lies in the future, or else in
          the past, and the present may be compared to a small dark cloud
          which the wind drives over the sunny plain: before and behind it
          all is bright, only it itself always casts a shadow. The present is
          therefore always insufficient; but the future is uncertain, and the
          past irrevocable. Life with its hourly, daily, weekly, yearly,
          little, greater, and great misfortunes, with its deluded hopes and
          its accidents destroying all our calculations, bears so distinctly
          the impression of something with which we must become disgusted,
          that it is hard to conceive how one has been able to mistake this
          and allow oneself to be persuaded that life is there in order to be
          thankfully enjoyed, and that man exists in order to be happy.
          Rather that continual illusion and disillusion, and also the nature
          of life throughout, presents itself to us as intended and
          calculated to awaken the conviction that nothing at all is worth
          our striving, our efforts and struggles, that all good things are
          vanity, the world in all its ends bankrupt, and life a business
          which does not cover its expenses;—so that our will may turn away
          from it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The way in which
          this vanity of all objects of the will makes itself known and
          comprehensible to the intellect which is rooted in the individual,
          is primarily <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">time</span></em>. It is the form by means of
          which that vanity of things appears as their perishableness; for on
          account of this all our pleasures and joys disappear in our hands,
          and we afterwards ask astonished where they have remained. That
          nothingness itself is therefore the only <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">objective</span></em> element in time,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, that which corresponds to
          it in the inner nature of things, thus that of which it is the
          expression. Just on this <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page384">[pg
          384]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg384"></a>
          account time is the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          priori</span></span> necessary form of all our perceptions; in it
          everything must present itself, even we ourselves. Accordingly,
          first of all, our life is like a payment which one receives in
          nothing but copper pence, and yet must then give a discharge for:
          the copper pence are the days; the discharge is death. For at last
          time makes known the judgment of nature concerning the work of all
          the beings which appear in it, in that it destroys them:—</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus old age and
          death, to which every life necessarily hurries on, are the sentence
          of condemnation on the will to live, coming from the hands of
          nature itself, and which declares that this will is an effort which
          frustrates itself. <span class="tei tei-q">“What thou hast
          wished,”</span> it says, <span class="tei tei-q">“ends thus: desire
          something better.”</span> Hence the instruction which his life
          affords to every one consists, as a whole, in this, that the
          objects of his desires continually delude, waver, and fall, and
          accordingly bring more misery than joy, till at last the whole

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We shall,
          however, enter into the details of the matter, for it is in these
          views that I have met with most contradiction. First of all, I have
          to confirm by the following remarks the proof given in the text of
          the negative nature of all satisfaction, thus of all pleasure and
          all happiness, in opposition to the positive nature of pain.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We feel pain,
          but not painlessness; we feel care, but <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page385">[pg 385]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg385"></a> not the absence of care; fear, but not
          security. We feel the wish as we feel hunger and thirst; but as
          soon as it has been fulfilled, it is like the mouthful that has
          been taken, which ceases to exist for our feeling the moment it is
          swallowed. Pleasures and joys we miss painfully whenever they are
          wanting; but pains, even when they cease after having long been
          present, are not directly missed, but at the most are intentionally
          thought of by means of reflection. For only pain and want can be
          felt positively, and therefore announce themselves; well-being, on
          the other hand, is merely negative. Therefore we do not become
          conscious of the three greatest blessings of life, health, youth,
          and freedom, so long as we possess them, but only after we have
          lost them; for they also are negations. We only observe that days
          of our life were happy after they have given place to unhappy ones.
          In proportion as pleasures increase, the susceptibility for them
          decreases: what is customary is no longer felt as a pleasure. Just
          in this way, however, is the susceptibility for suffering
          increased, for the loss of what we are accustomed to is painfully
          felt. Thus the measure of what is necessary increases through
          possession, and thereby the capacity for feeling pain. The hours
          pass the quicker the more agreeably they are spent, and the slower
          the more painfully they are spent; because pain, not pleasure, is
          the positive, the presence of which makes itself felt. In the same
          way we become conscious of time when we are bored, not when we are
          diverted. Both these cases prove that our existence is most happy
          when we perceive it least, from which it follows that it would be
          better not to have it. Great and lively joy can only be conceived
          as the consequence of great misery, which has preceded it; for
          nothing can be added to a state of permanent satisfaction but some
          amusement, or the satisfaction of vanity. Hence all poets are
          obliged to bring their heroes into anxious and painful situations,
          so that they may be able to free them from them. Dramas and Epics
          accordingly <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page386">[pg
          386]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg386"></a>
          always describe only fighting, suffering, tormented men; and every
          romance is a rareeshow in which we observe the spasms and
          convulsions of the agonised human heart. Walter Scott has naïvely
          expressed this æsthetic necessity in the conclusion to his novel,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Old Mortality.”</span> Voltaire, who was
          so highly favoured both by nature and fortune, says, in entire
          agreement with the truth proved by me: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">Le bonheur n'est qu'un rève,
          et la douleur est réelle</span></span>.”</span> And he adds:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">Il y a quatre-vingts
          ans que je l'éprouve. Je n'y sais autre chose que me résigner, et
          me dire que les mouches sont nées pour être mangées par les
          araignées, et les hommes pour être dévorés par les
          chagrins.</span></span>”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before so
          confidently affirming that life is a blessing worth desiring or
          giving thanks for, let one compare calmly the sum of the possible
          pleasures which a man can enjoy in his life with the sum of the
          possible sorrows which may come to him in his life. I believe the
          balance will not be hard to strike. At bottom, however, it is quite
          superfluous to dispute whether there is more good or evil in the
          world: for the mere existence of evil decides the matter. For the
          evil can never be annulled, and consequently can never be balanced
          by the good which may exist along with it or after it.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If the world and
          life were an end in themselves, and accordingly required
          theoretically no justification and practically no indemnification
          or compensation, but existed, for instance, as Spinoza and the
          Spinozists of the present day represent it, as the single
          manifestation of a God, who, <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">animi causa</span></span>, or else in order to
          mirror himself, undertook such an evolution of himself; and hence
          its existence neither required to be justified by reasons nor
          redeemed by results;—then the sufferings and miseries of life would
          not indeed have to be fully equalled by the pleasures and
          well-being in it; for this, as has been said, is impossible,
          because my present pain is never abolished by future joys, for the
          latter fill their time as the former fills its time: but there
          would have to be absolutely no suffering, and death also would
          either have not to be, or else to have no terrors for us. Only thus
          would life pay for itself.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But since now
          our state is rather something which had better not be, everything
          about us bears the trace of this,—just as in hell everything smells
          of sulphur—for everything is always imperfect and illusory,
          everything agreeable is displaced by something disagreeable, every
          enjoyment is only a half one, every pleasure introduces its own
          disturbance, every relief new difficulties, every aid of our daily
          and hourly need leaves us each moment in the lurch and denies its
          service, the step upon which we place <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page388">[pg 388]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg388"></a> our foot so often gives way under us, nay,
          misfortunes great and small are the element of our life; and, in a
          word, we are like Phineus, whose food was all tainted and made
          uneatable by the harpies.<a href="#note_42" id="noteref_42" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">42</span></span></a> Two
          remedies for this are tried: first, ευλαβεια, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          prudence, foresight, cunning; it does not fully instruct us, is
          insufficient, and leads to defeat. Secondly, the stoical equanimity
          which seeks to arm us against all misfortunes by preparedness for
          everything and contempt of all: practically it becomes cynical
          renunciation, which prefers once for all to reject all means of
          relief and all alleviations—it reduces us to the position of dogs,
          like Diogenes in his tub. The truth is, we ought to be wretched,
          and we are so. The chief source of the serious evils which affect
          men is man himself: <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">homo homini
          lupus</span></span>. Whoever keeps this last fact clearly in view
          beholds the world as a hell, which surpasses that of Dante in this
          respect, that one man must be the devil of another. For this, one
          is certainly more fitted than another; an arch-fiend, indeed, more
          fitted than all others, appearing in the form of a conqueror, who
          places several hundred thousand men opposite each other, and says
          to them: <span class="tei tei-q">“To suffer and die is your
          destiny; now shoot each other with guns and cannons,”</span> and
          they do so.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In general,
          however, the conduct of men towards each other is characterised as
          a rule by injustice, extreme unfairness, hardness, nay, cruelty: an
          opposite course of conduct appears only as an exception. Upon this
          depends the necessity of the State and legislation, and upon none
          of your false pretences. But in all cases which do not lie within
          the reach of the law, that regardlessness of his like, peculiar to
          man, shows itself at once; a regardlessness which springs from his
          boundless egoism, and sometimes also from wickedness. How man deals
          with man is shown, for example, by negro slavery, the final end of
          which is sugar and coffee. But we do not need to go so far:
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page389">[pg 389]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg389"></a> at the age of five
          years to enter a cotton-spinning or other factory, and from that
          time forth to sit there daily, first ten, then twelve, and
          ultimately fourteen hours, performing the same mechanical labour,
          is to purchase dearly the satisfaction of drawing breath. But this
          is the fate of millions, and that of millions more is analogous to
          it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We others,
          however, can be made perfectly miserable by trifling misfortunes;
          perfectly happy, not by the world. Whatever one may say, the
          happiest moment of the happy man is the moment of his falling
          asleep, and the unhappiest moment of the unhappy that of his
          awaking. An indirect but certain proof of the fact that men feel
          themselves unhappy, and consequently are so, is also abundantly
          afforded by the fearful envy which dwells in us all, and which in
          all relations of life, on the occasion of any superiority, of
          whatever kind it may be, is excited, and cannot contain its poison.
          Because they feel themselves unhappy, men cannot endure the sight
          of one whom they imagine happy; he who for the moment feels himself
          happy would like to make all around him happy also, and says:</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">

</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If life were in
          itself a blessing to be prized, and decidedly to be preferred to
          non-existence, the exit from it would not need to be guarded by
          such fearful sentinels as death and its terrors. But who would
          continue in life as it is if death were less terrible? And again,
          who could even endure the thought of death if life were a pleasure!
          But thus the former has still always this good, that it is the end
          of life, and we console ourselves with regard to the suffering of
          life with death, and with regard to death with the suffering of
          life. The truth is, that the two inseparably belong to each other,
          for together they constitute a deviation from the right path, to
          return to which is as difficult as it is desirable.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If the world
          were not something which, expressed <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">practically</span></em>, ought not to be, it
          would also not be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">theoretically</span></em> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page390">[pg 390]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg390"></a> a problem; but its existence would
          either require no explanation, inasmuch as it would be so entirely
          self-evident that wonder concerning it or a question about it could
          arise in no mind, or its end would present itself unmistakably.
          Instead of this, however, it is indeed an insoluble problem; for
          even the most perfect philosophy will yet always contain an
          unexplained element, like an insoluble deposit or the remainder
          which the irrational relation of two quantities always leaves over.
          Therefore if one ventures to raise the question why there is not
          rather nothing than this world, the world cannot be justified from
          itself, no ground, no final cause of its existence can be found in
          itself, it cannot be shown that it exists for its own sake,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, for its own advantage. In
          accordance with my teaching, this can certainly be explained from
          the fact that the principle of its existence is expressly one which
          is without ground, a blind will to live, which as thing in itself
          cannot be made subject to the principle of sufficient reason, which
          is merely the form of the phenomenon, and through which alone every
          why is justified. But this also agrees with the nature of the
          world, for only a blind will, no seeing will, could place itself in
          the position in which we behold ourselves. A seeing will would
          rather have soon made the calculation that the business did not
          cover the cost, for such a mighty effort and struggle with the
          straining of all the powers, under constant care, anxiety, and
          want, and with the inevitable destruction of every individual life,
          finds no compensation in the ephemeral existence itself, which is
          so obtained, and which passes into nothing in our hands. Hence,
          then, the explanation of the world from the Anaxagorean νους,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, from a will accompanied by
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">knowledge</span></em>, necessarily demands
          optimism to excuse it, which accordingly is set up and maintained
          in spite of the loudly crying evidence of a whole world full of
          misery. Life is there given out to be a gift, while it is evident
          that every one would have declined such a gift if he could have
          seen <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page391">[pg 391]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg391"></a> it and tested it
          beforehand; just as Lessing admired the understanding of his son,
          who, because he had absolutely declined to enter life, had to be
          forcibly brought into it with the forceps, but was scarcely there
          when he hurried away from it again. On the other hand, it is then
          well said that life should be, from one end to the other, only a
          lesson; to which, however, any one might reply: <span class="tei tei-q">“For this very reason I wish I had been left in the
          peace of the all-sufficient nothing, where I would have had no need
          of lessons or of anything else.”</span> If indeed it should now be
          added that he must one day give an account of every hour of his
          life, he would be more justified in himself demanding an account of
          why he had been transferred from that rest into such a
          questionable, dark, anxious, and painful situation. To this, then,
          we are led by false views. For human existence, far from bearing
          the character of a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">gift</span></em>, has entirely the character
          of a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">debt</span></em> that has been contracted. The
          calling in of this debt appears in the form of the pressing wants,
          tormenting desires, and endless misery established through this
          existence. As a rule, the whole lifetime is devoted to the paying
          off of this debt; but this only meets the interest. The payment of
          the capital takes place through death. And when was this debt
          contracted? At the begetting.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Accordingly, if
          we regard man as a being whose existence is a punishment and an
          expiation, we then view him in a right light. The myth of the fall
          (although probably, like the whole of Judaism, borrowed from the
          Zend-Avesta: Bundahish, 15), is the only point in the Old Testament
          to which I can ascribe metaphysical, although only allegorical,
          truth; indeed it is this alone that reconciles me to the Old
          Testament. Our existence resembles nothing so much as the
          consequence of a false step and a guilty desire. New Testament
          Christianity, the ethical spirit of which is that of Brahmanism and
          Buddhism, and is therefore very foreign to the otherwise optimistic
          spirit of the Old Testament, has also, very wisely, linked
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page392">[pg 392]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg392"></a> itself on precisely
          to that myth: indeed, without this it would have found no point of
          connection with Judaism at all. If any one desires to measure the
          degree of guilt with which our existence is tainted, then let him
          look at the suffering that is connected with it. Every great pain,
          whether bodily or mental, declares what we deserve: for it could
          not come to us if we did not deserve it. That Christianity also
          regards our existence in this light is shown by a passage in
          Luther's Commentary on Galatians, chap. 3, which I only have beside
          me in Latin: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Sumus autem nos omnes corporibus et rebus
          subjecti Diabolo, et hospites sumus in mundo, cujus ipse princeps
          et Deus est. Ideo panis, quem edimus, potus, quem bibimus, vestes,
          quibus utimur, imo aër et totum quo vivimus in carne, sub ipsius
          imperio est.</span></span>”</span> An outcry has been made about
          the melancholy and disconsolate nature of my philosophy; yet it
          lies merely in the fact that instead of inventing a future hell as
          the equivalent of sin, I show that where guilt lies in the world
          there is also already something akin to hell; but whoever is
          inclined to deny this can easily experience it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And to this
          world, to this scene of tormented and agonised beings, who only
          continue to exist by devouring each other, in which, therefore,
          every ravenous beast is the living grave of thousands of others,
          and its self-maintenance is a chain of painful deaths; and in which
          the capacity for feeling pain increases with knowledge, and
          therefore reaches its highest degree in man, a degree which is the
          higher the more intelligent the man is; to this world it has been
          sought to apply the system of optimism, and demonstrate to us that
          it is the best of all possible worlds. The absurdity is glaring.
          But an optimist bids me open my eyes and look at the world, how
          beautiful it is in the sunshine, with its mountains and valleys,
          streams, plants, animals, &amp;c. &amp;c. Is the world, then, a
          rareeshow? These things are certainly beautiful to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">look

          virtue of which it is taken care that the planets do not run their
          heads together, that land and sea do not get mixed into a pulp, but
          are held so beautifully apart, also that everything is neither
          rigid with continual frost nor roasted with heat; in the same way,
          that in consequence of the obliquity of the ecliptic there is no
          eternal spring, in which nothing could attain to ripeness, &amp;c.
          &amp;c. But this and all like it are mere <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">conditiones sine quibus non</span></span>. If
          in general there is to be a world at all, if its planets are to
          exist at least as long as the light of a distant fixed star
          requires to reach them, and are not, like Lessing's son, to depart
          again immediately after birth, then certainly it must not be so
          clumsily constructed that its very framework threatens to fall to
          pieces. But if one goes on to the results of this applauded work,
          considers the players who act upon the stage which is so durably
          constructed, and now sees how with sensibility pain appears, and
          increases in proportion as the sensibility develops to
          intelligence, and then how, keeping pace with this, desire and
          suffering come out ever more strongly, and increase till at last
          human life affords no other material than this for tragedies and
          comedies, then whoever is honest will scarcely be disposed to set
          up hallelujahs. David Hume, in his <span class="tei tei-q">“Natural
          History of Religion,”</span> §§ 6, 7, 8, and 13, has also exposed,
          mercilessly but with convincing truth, the real though concealed
          source of these last. He also explains clearly in the tenth and
          eleventh books of his <span class="tei tei-q">“Dialogues on Natural
          Religion,”</span> with very pertinent arguments, which are yet of
          quite a different kind from mine, the miserable nature of this
          world and the untenableness of all optimism; in doing which he
          attacks this in its origin. Both works of Hume's are as well worth
          reading as they are unknown at the present day in Germany, where,
          on the other hand, incredible pleasure is found, patriotically, in
          the most disgusting nonsense of home-bred boastful mediocrities,
          who are proclaimed great men. Hamann, however, translated these
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page394">[pg 394]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg394"></a> dialogues; Kant went
          through the translation, and late in life wished to induce Hamann's
          son to publish them because the translation of Platner did not
          satisfy him (see Kant's biography by F. W. Schubert, pp. 81 and
          165). From every page of David Hume there is more to be learned
          than from the collected philosophical works of Hegel, Herbart, and
          Schleiermacher together.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The founder of
          systematic optimism, again, is Leibnitz whose philosophical merit I
          have no intention of denying although I have never succeeded in
          thinking myself into the monadology, pre-established harmony, and
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">identitas indiscernibilium</span></span>. His
          <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Nouveaux essays sur
          l'entendement</span></span>”</span> are, however, merely an
          excerpt, with a full yet weak criticism, with a view to correction,
          of Locke's work which is justly of world-wide reputation. He here
          opposes Locke with just as little success as he opposes Newton in
          the <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tentamen de motuum cœlestium
          causis</span></span>,”</span> directed against the system of
          gravitation. The <span class="tei tei-q">“Critique of Pure
          Reason”</span> is specially directed against this Leibnitz-Wolfian
          philosophy, and has a polemical, nay, a destructive relation to it,
          just as it is related to Locke and Hume as a continuation and
          further construction. That at the present day the professors of
          philosophy are on all sides engaged in setting Leibnitz, with his
          juggling, upon his legs again, nay, in glorifying him, and, on the
          other hand, in depreciating and setting aside Kant as much as
          possible, has its sufficient reason in the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">primum vivere</span></span>; the <span class="tei tei-q">“Critique of Pure Reason”</span> does not admit of one
          giving out Judaistic mythology as philosophy, nor of one speaking,
          without ceremony, of the <span class="tei tei-q">“soul”</span> as a
          given reality, a well-known and well-accredited person, without
          giving account of how one arrived at this conception, and what
          justification one has for using it scientifically. But <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">primum vivere, deinde
          philosophari</span></span>! Down with Kant, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">vivat</span></span> our Leibnitz! To return,
          then, to Leibnitz, I cannot ascribe to the Théodicée, as a
          methodical and broad unfolding of optimism, any other merit than
          this, that it gave occasion later for <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page395">[pg 395]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg395"></a> the immortal <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Candide</span></span>”</span> of the great
          Voltaire; whereby certainly Leibnitz's often-repeated and lame
          excuse for the evil of the world, that the bad sometimes brings
          about the good, received a confirmation which was unexpected by
          him. Even by the name of his hero Voltaire indicates that it only
          requires sincerity to recognise the opposite of optimism. Really
          upon this scene of sin, suffering, and death optimism makes such an
          extraordinary figure that one would be forced to regard it as irony
          if one had not a sufficient explanation of its origin in the secret
          source of it (insincere flattery, with insulting confidence in its
          success), which, as was mentioned above, is so delightfully
          disclosed by Hume.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But indeed to
          the palpably sophistical proofs of Leibnitz that this is the best
          of all possible worlds, we may seriously and honestly oppose the
          proof that it is the worst of all possible worlds. For possible
          means, not what one may construct in imagination, but what can
          actually exist and continue. Now this world is so arranged as to be
          able to maintain itself with great difficulty; but if it were a
          little worse, it could no longer maintain itself. Consequently a
          worse world, since it could not continue to exist, is absolutely
          impossible: thus this world itself is the worst of all possible
          worlds. For not only if the planets were to run their heads
          together, but even if any one of the actually appearing
          perturbations of their course, instead of being gradually balanced
          by others, continued to increase, the world would soon reach its
          end. Astronomers know upon what accidental
          circumstances—principally the irrational relation to each other of
          the periods of revolution—this depends, and have carefully
          calculated that it will always go on well; consequently the world
          also can continue and go on. We will hope that, although Newton was
          of an opposite opinion, they have not miscalculated, and
          consequently that the mechanical perpetual motion realised in such
          a planetary system will not also, like the rest, ultimately come to
          a standstill. Again, under the firm <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page396">[pg 396]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg396"></a> crust of the planet dwell the powerful forces
          of nature which, as soon as some accident affords them free play,
          must necessarily destroy that crust, with everything living upon
          it, as has already taken place at least three times upon our
          planet, and will probably take place oftener still. The earthquake
          of Lisbon, the earthquake of Haiti, the destruction of Pompeii, are
          only small, playful hints of what is possible. A small alteration
          of the atmosphere, which cannot even be chemically proved, causes
          cholera, yellow fever, black death, &amp;c., which carry off
          millions of men; a somewhat greater alteration would extinguish all
          life. A very moderate increase of heat would dry up all the rivers
          and springs. The brutes have received just barely so much in the
          way of organs and powers as enables them to procure with the
          greatest exertion sustenance for their own lives and food for their
          offspring; therefore if a brute loses a limb, or even the full use
          of one, it must generally perish. Even of the human race, powerful
          as are the weapons it possesses in understanding and reason,
          nine-tenths live in constant conflict with want, always balancing
          themselves with difficulty and effort upon the brink of
          destruction. Thus throughout, as for the continuance of the whole,
          so also for that of each individual being the conditions are barely
          and scantily given, but nothing over. The individual life is a
          ceaseless battle for existence itself; while at every step
          destruction threatens it. Just because this threat is so often
          fulfilled provision had to be made, by means of the enormous excess
          of the germs, that the destruction of the individuals should not
          involve that of the species, for which alone nature really cares.
          The world is therefore as bad as it possibly can be if it is to
          continue to be at all. <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Q. E.
          D.</span></span> The fossils of the entirely different kinds of
          animal species which formerly inhabited the planet afford us, as a
          proof of our calculation, the records of worlds the continuance of
          which was no longer possible, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page397">[pg 397]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg397"></a> and which consequently were somewhat worse
          than the worst of possible worlds.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Optimism is at
          bottom the unmerited self-praise of the real originator of the
          world, the will to live, which views itself complacently in its
          works; and accordingly it is not only a false, but also a
          pernicious doctrine. For it presents life to us as a desirable
          condition, and the happiness of man as the end of it. Starting from
          this, every one then believes that he has the most just claim to
          happiness and pleasure; and if, as is wont to happen, these do not
          fall to his lot, then he believes that he is wronged, nay, that he
          loses the end of his existence; while it is far more correct to
          regard work, privation, misery, and suffering, crowned by death, as
          the end of our life (as Brahmanism and Buddhism, and also genuine
          Christianity do); for it is these which lead to the denial of the
          will to live. In the New Testament the world is represented as a
          valley of tears, life as a process of purifying or refining, and
          the symbol of Christianity is an instrument of torture. Therefore,
          when Leibnitz, Shaftesbury, Bolingbroke, and Pope brought forward
          optimism, the general offence which it gave depended principally
          upon the fact that optimism is irreconcilable with Christianity; as
          Voltaire states and explains in the preface to his excellent poem,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Le désastre de Lisbonne</span></span>,”</span>
          which is also expressly directed against optimism. This great man,
          whom I so gladly praise, in opposition to the abuse of venal German
          ink-slingers, is placed decidedly higher than Rousseau by the
          insight to which he attained in three respects, and which prove the
          greater depth of his thinking: (1) the recognition of the
          preponderating magnitude of the evil and misery of existence with
          which he is deeply penetrated; (2) that of the strict necessity of
          the acts of will; (3) that of the truth of Locke's principle, that
          what thinks may also be material: while Rousseau opposes all this
          with declamations in his <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Profession de foi du
          vicaire Savoyard</span></span>,”</span> a superficial Protestant
          pastor's philosophy; as he also in the same spirit <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page398">[pg 398]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg398"></a> attacks the beautiful poem of Voltaire
          which has just been referred to with ill-founded, shallow, and
          logically false reasoning, in the interests of optimism, in his
          long letter to Voltaire of 18th August 1756, which is devoted
          simply to this purpose. Indeed, the fundamental characteristic and
          the πρωτον ψευδος of Rousseau's whole philosophy is this, that in
          the place of the Christian doctrine of original sin, and the
          original depravity of the human race, he puts an original goodness
          and unlimited perfectibility of it, which has only been led astray
          by civilisation and its consequences, and then founds upon this his
          optimism and humanism.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As in
          <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Candide</span></span>”</span> Voltaire wages
          war in his facetious manner against optimism, Byron has also done
          so in his serious and tragic style, in his immortal masterpiece,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Cain,”</span> on account of which he also
          has been honoured with the invectives of the obscurantist,
          Friedrich Schlegel. If now, in conclusion, to confirm my view, I
          were to give what has been said by great men of all ages in this
          anti-optimistic spirit, there would be no end to the quotations,
          for almost every one of them has expressed in strong language his
          knowledge of the misery of this world. Thus, not to confirm, but
          merely to embellish this chapter, a few quotations of this kind may
          be given at the end of it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">First of all,
          let me mention here that the Greeks, far as they were from the
          Christian and lofty Asiatic conception of the world, and although
          they decidedly stood at the point of view of the assertion of the
          will, were yet deeply affected by the wretchedness of existence.
          This is shown even by the invention of tragedy, which belongs to
          them. Another proof of it is afforded us by the custom of the
          Thracians, which is first mentioned by Herodotus, though often
          referred to afterwards—the custom of welcoming the new-born child
          with lamentations, and recounting all the evils which now lie
          before it; and, on the other hand, burying the dead with mirth and
          jesting, because they are no longer exposed to so many and great
          sufferings. In a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page399">[pg

<span style="font-size: 144%">On Ethics.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here is the
          great gap which occurs in these supplements, on account of the
          circumstance that I have already dealt with moral philosophy in the
          narrower sense in the two prize essays published under the title,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Die Grundprobleme der
          Ethik</span></span>,”</span> an acquaintance with which is assumed,
          as I have said, in order to avoid useless repetition. Therefore
          there only remains for me here a small gleaning of isolated
          reflections which could not be discussed in that work, the contents
          of which were, in the main, prescribed by the Academies; least of
          all those reflections which demand a higher point of view than that
          which is common to all, and which I was there obliged to adhere to.
          Accordingly it will not surprise the reader to find these
          reflections here in a very fragmentary collection. This collection
          again has been continued in the eighth and ninth chapters of the
          second volume of the Parerga.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That moral
          investigations are incomparably more difficult than physical, and
          in general than any others, results from the fact that they are
          almost immediately concerned with the thing in itself, namely, with
          that manifestation of it in which, directly discovered by the light
          of knowledge, it reveals its nature as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em>.
          Physical truths, on the other hand, remain entirely in the province
          of the idea, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, of the phenomenon, and
          merely show how the lowest manifestations of the will present
          themselves in the idea in conformity to law. Further, the
          consideration <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page403">[pg
          403]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg403"></a>
          of the world from the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">physical</span></em> side, however far and
          successfully it may be pursued, is in its results without any
          consolation for us: on the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">moral</span></em> side alone is consolation to
          be found; for here the depths of our own inner nature disclose
          themselves to the consideration.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But my
          philosophy is the only one which confers upon ethics its complete
          and whole rights; for only if the true nature of man is his own
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em>, and consequently he is, in
          the strictest sense, his own work, are his deeds really entirely
          his and to be ascribed to him. On the other hand, whenever he has
          another origin, or is the work of a being different from himself,
          all his guilt falls back upon this origin, or originator. For
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">operari sequitur esse</span></span>.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To connect the
          force which produces the phenomenon of the world, and consequently
          determines its nature, with the morality of the disposition or
          character, and thus to establish a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">moral</span></em>
          order of the world as the foundation of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">physical</span></em>,—this has been since
          Socrates the problem of philosophy. Theism solved it in a childish
          manner, which could not satisfy mature humanity. Therefore
          pantheism opposed itself to it whenever it ventured to do so, and
          showed that nature bears in itself the power by virtue of which it
          appears. With this, however, ethics had necessarily to be given up.
          Spinoza, indeed, attempts here and there to preserve it by means of
          sophistry, but for the most part gives it up altogether, and, with
          a boldness which excites astonishment and repugnance, explains the
          distinction between right and wrong, and in general between good
          and evil, as merely conventional, thus in itself empty (for
          example, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Eth.</span></span> iv., prop. 37, schol. 2).
          After having met with unmerited neglect for more than a hundred
          years, Spinoza has, in general, become too much esteemed in this
          century through the reaction caused by the swing of the pendulum of
          opinion. All pantheism must ultimately be overthrown by the
          inevitable demands of ethics, and then by the evil and suffering of
          the world. If the world is a theophany, then all that man, or even
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page404">[pg 404]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg404"></a> the brute, does is
          equally divine and excellent; nothing can be censurable, and
          nothing more praiseworthy than the rest: thus there is no ethics.
          Hence, in consequence of the revived Spinozism of our own day, thus
          of pantheism, the treatment of ethics has sunk so low and become so
          shallow that it has been made a mere instruction as to the proper
          life of a citizen and a member of a family, in which the ultimate
          end of human existence is supposed to consist: thus in methodical,
          complete, smug, and comfortable philistinism. Pantheism, indeed,
          has only led to such shallow vulgarisms through the fact that (by a
          shameful misuse of the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">e quovis ligno fit
          Mercurius</span></span>) a common mind, Hegel, has, by the
          well-known means, been falsely stamped as a great philosopher, and
          a herd of his disciples, at first suborned, afterwards only stupid,
          received his weighty words. Such outrages on the human mind do not
          remain unpunished: the seed has sprouted. In the same spirit it was
          then asserted that ethics should have for its material not the
          conduct of individuals, but that of nations, that this alone was a
          theme worthy of it. Nothing can be more perverse than this view,
          which rests on the most vulgar realism. For in every individual
          appears the whole undivided will to live, the thing in itself, and
          the microcosm is like the macrocosm. The masses have no more
          content than each individual. Ethics is concerned not with actions
          and their results, but with willing, and willing itself takes place
          only in the individual. Not the fate of nations, which exists only
          in the phenomenon, but that of the individual is decided <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">morally</span></em>. Nations are really mere
          abstractions; individuals alone actually exist. Thus, then, is
          pantheism related to ethics. But the evil and misery of the world
          are not in accord even with theism; hence it sought assistance from
          all kinds of evasions, theodicies, which yet were irretrievably
          overthrown by the arguments of Hume and Voltaire. Pantheism,
          however, is completely untenable in the presence of that bad side
          of the world. Only when the world is <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page405">[pg 405]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg405"></a> regarded entirely from without and from the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">physical</span></em> side alone, and nothing
          else is kept in view but the constant restorative order, and the
          comparative imperishableness of the whole which is thereby
          introduced, is it perhaps possible to explain it as a god, yet
          always only symbolically. But if one enters within, thus considers
          also the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">subjective</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">moral</span></em>
          side, with its preponderance of want, suffering, and misery, of
          dissension, wickedness, madness, and perversity, then one soon
          becomes conscious with horror that the last thing imaginable one
          has before one is a theophany. I, however, have shown, and
          especially in my work <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ueber den Willen in
          der Natur</span></span>”</span> have proved, that the force which
          works and acts in nature is identical with the will in us. Thereby
          the moral order of the world is brought into direct connection with
          the force which produces the phenomenon of the world. For the
          phenomenon of the will must exactly correspond to its nature. Upon
          this depends the exposition of eternal justice given in §§ 63 and
          64 of the first volume, and the world, although subsisting by its
          own power, receives throughout a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">moral</span></em>
          tendency. Accordingly the problem which has been discussed from the
          time of Socrates is now for the first time really solved, and the
          demand of thinking reason directed to morality is satisfied. Yet I
          have never professed to propound a philosophy which leaves no
          questions unanswered. In this sense philosophy is really
          impossible: it would be the science of omniscience. But <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">est quadam prodire tenus, si non datur
          ultra</span></span>: there is a limit to which reflection can
          penetrate and can so far lighten the night of our existence,
          although the horizon always remains dark. My doctrine reaches this
          limit in the will to live, which in its own manifestation asserts
          or denies itself. To wish, however, to go beyond this is, in my
          eyes, like wishing to fly beyond the atmosphere. We must stop
          there; even although new problems arise out of those which have
          been solved. Besides this, however, we must refer to the fact that
          the validity of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page406">[pg
          406]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg406"></a>
          the principle of sufficient reason is limited to the phenomenon;
          this was the theme of my first essay on that principle, which was
          published as early as 1813.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I now go on to
          supplement particular points, and shall begin by supporting, with
          two passages from classical poetry, my explanation of weeping given
          in § 67 of the first volume, that it springs from sympathy the
          object of which is one's own self. At the end of the eighth book of
          the <span class="tei tei-q">“Odyssey,”</span> Ulysses, who in all
          his many sorrows is never represented as weeping, bursts into
          tears, when, still unknown, he hears his early heroic life and
          deeds sung by the bard Demodocus in the palace of the Phæacian
          king, for this remembrance of the brilliant period of his life
          contrasts with his present wretchedness. Thus not this itself
          directly, but the objective consideration of it, the picture of his
          present summoned up by his past, calls forth his tears; he feels
          sympathy with himself. Euripides makes the innocently condemned
          Hypolytus, bemoaning his own fate, express the same feeling:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Finally, as a
          proof of my explanation, an anecdote may be given here which I take
          from the English journal <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Herald</span></span> of the 16th July
          1836. A client, when he had heard his case set forth by his counsel
          in court, burst into a flood of tears, and cried, <span class="tei tei-q">“I never knew I had suffered half so much till I heard
          it here to-day.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I have shown in
          § 55 of the first volume how, notwithstanding the unalterable
          nature of the character, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, of the special fundamental
          will of a man, a real moral repentance is yet possible. I wish,
          however, to add the following explanation, which I must preface by
          a few definitions. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Inclination</span></em> is every strong
          susceptibility of the will for motives of a certain kind.
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Passion</span></em> is an inclination so
          strong that <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page407">[pg
          407]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg407"></a>
          the motives which excite it exercise a power over the will, which
          is stronger than that of every possible motive that can oppose
          them; thus its mastery over the will becomes absolute, and
          consequently with reference to it the will is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">passive</span></em>
          or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">suffering</span></em>. It must, however, be
          remarked here that passions seldom reach the degree at which they
          fully answer to the definition, but rather bear their name as mere
          approximations to it: therefore there are then still
          counter-motives which are able at least to restrict their effect,
          if only they appear distinctly in consciousness. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">emotion</span></em>
          is just as irresistible, but yet only a passing excitement of the
          will, by a motive which receives its power, not from a deeply
          rooted inclination, but merely from the fact that, appearing
          suddenly, it excludes for the moment the counter-effect of all
          other motives, for it consists of an idea, which completely
          obscures all others by its excessive vividness, or, as it were,
          conceals them entirely by its too close proximity, so that they
          cannot enter consciousness and act on the will, whereby, therefore,
          the capacity for reflection, and with it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intellectual
          freedom</span></em>, is to a certain extent abolished. Accordingly
          the emotion is related to the passion as delirium to madness.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Moral repentance
          is now conditioned by the fact that before the act the inclination
          to it did not leave the intellect free scope, because it did not
          allow it to contemplate clearly and fully the counter-motives, but
          rather turned it ever anew to the motives in its own favour. But
          now, after the act has been performed, these motives are, by this
          itself, neutralised, and consequently have become ineffective. Now
          reality brings before the intellect the counter-motives as the
          consequences of the act which have already appeared; and the
          intellect now knows that they would have been the stronger if it
          had only adequately contemplated and weighed them. Thus the man
          becomes conscious that he has done what was really not in
          accordance with his will. This knowledge is repentance, for he has
          not acted with full intellectual freedom; for all the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page408">[pg 408]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg408"></a> motives did not attain to efficiency.
          What excluded the motives opposed to the action was in the case of
          the hasty action the emotion, and in the case of the deliberate
          action the passion. It has also often depended upon the
          circumstance that his reason certainly presented to him the
          counter-motives in the abstract, but was not supported by a
          sufficiently strong imagination to present to him their whole
          content and true significance in images. Examples of what has been
          said are the cases in which revenge, jealousy, or avarice have led
          to murder. After it is committed they are extinguished, and now
          justice, sympathy, the remembrance of former friendship, raise
          their voices and say all that they would have said before if they
          had been allowed to speak. Then enters the bitter repentance, which
          says, <span class="tei tei-q">“If it were not done it would never
          happen.”</span> An incomparable representation of this is afforded
          by the old Scottish ballad, which has also been translated by
          Herder, <span class="tei tei-q">“Edward, Edward.”</span> In an
          analogous manner, the neglect of one's own good may occasion an
          egotistical repentance. For example, when an otherwise unadvisable
          marriage is concluded in consequence of passionate love, which now
          is extinguished just by the marriage, and for the first time the
          counter-motives of personal interest, lost independence, &amp;c.,
          &amp;c., come into consciousness, and speak as they would have
          spoken before if they had been allowed utterance. All such actions
          accordingly spring from a relative weakness of intellect, because
          it lets itself be mastered by the will, just where its function as
          the presenter of motives ought to have been inexorably fulfilled,
          without allowing itself to be disturbed by the will. The vehemence
          of the will is here only <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">indirectly</span></em> the cause, in that it
          interferes with the intellect, and thereby prepares for itself
          repentance. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">reasonableness</span></em> of the character
          σωφροσυνη, which is opposed to passionateness, really consists in
          this, that the will never overpowers the intellect to such an
          extent as to prevent it from correctly exercising its function of
          the distinct, full, and clear exposition of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page409">[pg 409]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg409"></a> motives in the abstract for the reason,
          in the concrete for the imagination. Now this may just as well
          depend upon the moderation and mildness of the will as upon the
          strength of the intellect. All that is required is that the latter
          should be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">relatively</span></em> strong enough for the
          will that is present, thus that the two should stand in a suitable
          relation to each other.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The following
          explanations have still to be added to the fundamental
          characteristics of the philosophy of law expounded in § 62 of the
          first volume, and also in my prize essay on the foundation of
          morals, § 17.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Those who, with
          Spinoza, deny that there is a right apart from the State, confound
          the means for enforcing the right with the right itself. Certainly
          the right is insured protection only in the State. But it itself
          exists independently of the State. For by force it can only be
          suppressed, never abolished. Accordingly the State is nothing more
          than an institution for protection, which has become necessary
          through the manifold attacks to which man is exposed, and which he
          would not be able to ward off alone, but only in union with others.
          So, then, the aims of the State are—</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(1.) First of
          all, outward protection, which may just as well become needful
          against lifeless forces of nature or wild beasts as against men,
          consequently against other nations; although this case is the most
          frequent and important, for the worst enemy of man is man:
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">homo homini lupus</span></span>. Since, in
          consequence of this aim, nations always set up the principle, in
          words if not with deeds, that they wish to stand to each other in a
          purely defensive, never in an aggressive relation, they recognise
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the law
          of nations</span></em>. This is at bottom nothing but natural law,
          in the only sphere of its practical activity that remains to it,
          between nation and nation, where it alone must reign, because its
          stronger son, positive law, cannot assert itself, since it requires
          a judge and an executive. Accordingly the law of nations consists
          of a certain degree of morality in the dealings of nations with
          each other, the maintenance of which <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page410">[pg 410]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg410"></a> is a question of honour for mankind. The bar
          at which cases based on this law are tried is that of public
          opinion.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(2.) Protection
          within, thus protection of the members of a State against each
          other, consequently security of private right, by means of the
          maintenance of an honest state of things, which consists in this,
          that the concentrated forces of all protect each individual, from
          which arises an appearance as if all were honest, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          just, thus as if no one wished to injure the others.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But, as is
          always the way in human affairs, the removal of one evil generally
          opens the way for a new one; thus the granting of that double
          protection introduces the need of a third, namely: (3.) Protection
          against the protector, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, against him or those to
          whom the society has transferred the management of the protection,
          thus the guarantee of public right. This appears most completely
          attainable by dividing and separating from each other the threefold
          unity of the protective power, thus the legislature, the
          judicature, and the executive, so that each is managed by others,
          and independently of the rest. The great value, indeed the
          fundamental idea of the monarchy appears to me to lie in the fact
          that because men remain men one must be placed so high, and so much
          power, wealth, security, and absolute inviolability given him that
          there remains nothing for him to desire, to hope, and to fear for
          himself; whereby the egoism which dwells in him, as in every one,
          is annihilated, as it were, by neutralisation, and he is now able,
          as if he were no longer a man, to practise justice, and to keep in
          view no longer his own but only the public good. This is the source
          of the seemingly superhuman nature that everywhere accompanies
          royalty, and distinguishes it so infinitely from the mere
          presidency. Therefore it must also be hereditary, not elective;
          partly in order that no one may see his equal in the king; partly
          that the king himself may only be able to provide for his
          successors by caring for the welfare of the State, which is
          absolutely one with that of his family.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page411">[pg 411]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg411"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If other ends
          besides that of protection, here explained, are ascribed to the
          State, this may easily endanger the true end.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">According to my
          explanation, the right of property arises only through the
          expenditure of labour upon things. This truth, which has already
          often been expressed, finds a noteworthy confirmation in the fact
          that it is asserted, even in a practical regard, in a declaration
          of the American ex-president, Quincey Adams, which is to be found
          in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Quarterly Review</span></span> of 1840, No.
          130; and also in French, in the <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bibliothèque universelle de
          Genêve</span></span>,”</span> July 1840, No. 55. I will give it
          here in German (English of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Quarterly Review</span></span>): <span class="tei tei-q">“There are moralists who have questioned the right of
          the Europeans to intrude upon the possessions of the aboriginals in
          any case, and under any limitations whatsoever; but have they
          maturely considered the whole subject? The Indian right of
          possession itself stands, with regard to the greatest part of the
          country, upon a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">questionable</span></em> foundation. Their
          cultivated fields, their constructed habitations, a space of ample
          sufficiency for their subsistence, and whatever they had annexed of
          themselves by personal labour, was undoubtedly by the laws of
          nature theirs. But what is the right of a huntsman to the forest of
          a thousand miles over which he has accidentally ranged in quest of
          prey?”</span> &amp;c. In the same way, those who in our own day
          have seen occasion to combat communism with reasons (for example,
          the Archbishop of Paris, in his pastoral of June 1851) have always
          brought forward the argument that property is the result of work,
          as it were only embodied work. This is further evidence that the
          right of property can only be established by the application of
          work to things, for only in this respect does it find free
          recognition and make itself morally valid.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">An entirely
          different kind of proof of the same truth is afforded by the moral
          fact that while the law punishes poaching just as severely as
          theft, and in many countries more severely, yet civil honour, which
          is irrevocably lost <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page412">[pg
          412]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg412"></a>
          by the latter, is really not affected by the former; but the
          poacher, if he has been guilty of nothing else, is certainly
          tainted with a fault, but yet is not regarded, like the thief, as
          dishonourable and shunned by all. For the principles of civil
          honour rest upon moral and not upon mere positive law; but game is
          not an object upon which labour is bestowed, and thus also is not
          an object of a morally valid possession: the right to it is
          therefore entirely a positive one, and is not morally
          recognised.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">According to my
          view, the principle ought to lie at the basis of criminal law that
          it is not really the man but only the deed which is punished, in
          order that it may not recur. The criminal is merely the subject in
          whom the deed is punished, in order that the law in consequence of
          which the punishment is inflicted may retain its deterrent power.
          This is the meaning of the expression, <span class="tei tei-q">“He
          is forfeited to the law.”</span> According to Kant's explanation,
          which amounts to a <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">jus
          talionis</span></span>, it is not the deed but the man that is
          punished. The penitentiary system also seeks not so much to punish
          the deed as the man, in order to reform him. It thereby sets aside
          the real aim of punishment, determent from the deed, in order to
          attain the very problematic end of reformation. But it is always a
          doubtful thing to attempt to attain two different ends by
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> means: how much more so if the
          two are in any sense opposite ends. Education is a benefit,
          punishment ought to be an evil; the penitentiary prison is supposed
          to accomplish both at once. Moreover, however large a share
          untutored ignorance, combined with outward distress, may have in
          many crimes, yet we dare not regard these as their principal cause,
          for innumerable persons living in the same ignorance and under
          absolutely similar circumstances commit no crimes. Thus the
          substance of the matter falls back upon the personal, moral
          character; but this, as I have shown in my prize essay on the
          freedom of the will, is absolutely unalterable. Therefore moral
          reformation is really not possible, but only determent <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page413">[pg 413]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg413"></a> from the deed through fear. At the same
          time, the correction of knowledge and the awakening of the desire
          to work can certainly be attained; it will appear what effect this
          can produce. Besides this, it appears to me, from the aim of
          punishment set forth in the text, that, when possible, the apparent
          severity of the punishment should exceed the actual: but solitary
          confinement achieves the reverse. Its great severity has no
          witnesses, and is by no means anticipated by any one who has not
          experienced it; thus it does not deter. It threatens him who is
          tempted to crime by want and misery with the opposite pole of human
          suffering, ennui: but, as Goethe rightly observes—</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
          contemplation of it will deter him just as little as the sight of
          the palatial prisons which are built by honest men for rogues. If,
          however, it is desired that these penitentiary prisons should be
          regarded as educational institutions, then it is to be regretted
          that the entrance to them is only obtained by crimes, instead of
          which it ought to have preceded them.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That punishment,
          as Beccaria has taught, ought to bear a proper proportion to the
          crime does not depend upon the fact that it would be an expiation
          of it, but rather on the fact that the pledge ought to be
          proportionate to the value of that for which it answers. Therefore
          every one is justified in demanding the pledge of the life of
          another as a guarantee for the security of his own life, but not
          for the security of his property, for which the freedom, and so
          forth, of another is sufficient pledge. For the security of the
          life of the citizens capital punishment is therefore absolutely
          necessary. Those who wish to abolish it should be answered,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“First remove murder from the world, and
          then capital punishment ought to follow.”</span> It ought also to
          be inflicted for the clear attempt to murder just as for
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page414">[pg 414]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg414"></a> murder itself; for
          the law desires to punish the deed, not to revenge its
          consequences. In general the injury to be guarded against affords
          the right measure for the punishment which is to be threatened, but
          it does not give the moral baseness of the forbidden action.
          Therefore the law may rightly impose the punishment of imprisonment
          for allowing a flower-pot to fall from a window, or impose hard
          labour for smoking in the woods during the summer, and yet permit
          it in the winter. But to impose the punishment of death, as in
          Poland, for shooting an ure-ox is too much, for the maintenance of
          the species of ure-oxen may not be purchased with human life. In
          determining the measure of the punishment, along with the magnitude
          of the injury to be guarded against, we have to consider the
          strength of the motives which impel to the forbidden action. Quite
          a different standard of punishment would be established if
          expiation, retribution, <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">jus
          talionis</span></span>, were its true ground. But the criminal code
          ought to be nothing but a register of counter-motives for possible
          criminal actions: therefore each of these motives must decidedly
          outweigh the motives which lead to these actions, and indeed so
          much the more the greater the evil is which would arise from the
          action to be guarded against, the stronger the temptation to it,
          and the more difficult the conviction of the criminal;—always under
          the correct assumption that the will is not free, but determinable
          by motives;—apart from this it could not be got at at all. So much
          for the philosophy of law.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In my prize
          essay on the freedom of the will (p. 50 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">seq.</span></span>) I
          have proved the originality and unalterableness of the inborn
          character, from which the moral content of the course of life
          proceeds. It is established as a fact. But in order to understand
          problems in their full extent it is sometimes necessary to oppose
          opposites sharply to each other. In this case, then, let one recall
          how incredibly great is the inborn difference between man and man,
          in a moral and in an intellectual regard. Here nobleness and
          wisdom; <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page415">[pg
          415]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg415"></a>
          there wickedness and stupidity. In one the goodness of the heart
          shines out of the eyes, or the stamp of genius is enthroned in his
          countenance. The base physiognomy of another is the impression of
          moral worthlessness and intellectual dulness, imprinted by the
          hands of nature itself, unmistakable and ineradicable; he looks as
          if he must be ashamed of existence. But to this outward appearance
          the inner being really corresponds. We cannot possibly assume that
          such differences, which transform the whole being of the man, and
          which nothing can abolish, which, further, in conflict with his
          circumstances, determine his course of life, could exist without
          guilt or merit on the part of those affected by them, and be merely
          the work of chance. Even from this it is evident that the man must
          be in a certain sense his own work. But now, on the other hand, we
          can show the source of these differences empirically in the nature
          of the parents; and besides this, the meeting and connection of
          these parents has clearly been the work of the most accidental
          circumstances. By such considerations, then, we are forcibly
          directed to the distinction between the phenomenon and the true
          being of things, which alone can contain the solution of that
          problem. The thing in itself only reveals itself by means of the
          forms of the phenomenon; therefore what proceeds from the thing in
          itself must yet appear in those forms, thus also in the bonds of
          causality. Accordingly it will present itself to us here as a
          mysterious and incomprehensible guidance of things, of which the
          external empirical connection would be the mere tool. Yet all that
          happens appears in this empirical connection introduced by causes,
          thus necessarily and determined from without, while its true ground
          lies in the inner nature of what thus manifests itself. Certainly
          we can here see the solution of the problem only from afar, and
          when we reflect upon it we fall into an abyss of thought—as Hamlet
          very truly says, <span class="tei tei-q">“thoughts beyond the
          reaches of our souls.”</span> In my essay in the first volume of
          the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page416">[pg 416]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg416"></a> Parerga <span class="tei tei-q">“On the Appearance of Intention in the Fate of
          Individuals”</span> I have set forth my thoughts upon this
          mysterious guidance of things, a guidance which indeed can only be
          conceived symbolically.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In § 14 of my
          prize essay on the foundation of morals there will be found an
          exposition of egoism, as regards its nature; and the following
          attempt to discover its root may be looked upon as supplementary to
          that paragraph. Nature itself contradicts itself directly,
          according as it speaks from the individual or the universal, from
          within or from without, from the centre or the periphery. It has
          its centre in every individual; for each individual is the whole
          will to live. Therefore, even if this individual is only an insect
          or a worm, nature itself speaks out of it thus: <span class="tei tei-q">“I alone am all in all: in my maintenance everything is
          involved; the rest may perish, it is really nothing.”</span> So
          speaks nature from the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">particular</span></em> standpoint, thus from
          the point of view of self-consciousness, and upon this depends the
          egoism of every living thing. On the other hand, from the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">universal</span></em> point of view,—which is
          that of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">consciousness of other things</span></em>,
          that of objective knowledge, which for the moment looks away from
          the individual with whom the knowledge is connected,—from without
          then, from the periphery nature speaks thus: <span class="tei tei-q">“The individual is nothing, and less than nothing. I
          destroy millions of individuals every day, for sport and pastime: I
          abandon their fate to the most capricious and wilful of my
          children, chance, who harasses them at pleasure. I produce millions
          of new individuals every day, without any diminution of my
          productive power; just as little as the power of a mirror is
          exhausted by the number of reflections of the sun, which it casts
          on the wall one after another. The individual is nothing.”</span>
          Only he who knows how to really reconcile and eliminate this patent
          contradiction of nature has a true answer to the question as to the
          perishableness and imperishableness of his own self. I believe I
          have given, in the first four <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page417">[pg 417]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg417"></a> chapters of this fourth book of the
          supplements, an adequate introduction to such knowledge. What is
          said above may further be illustrated in the following manner.
          Every individual, when he looks within, recognises in his nature,
          which is his will, the thing in itself, therefore that which
          everywhere alone is real. Accordingly he conceives himself as the
          kernel and centre of the world, and regards himself as of infinite
          importance. If, on the other hand, he looks without, then he is in
          the province of the idea the mere phenomenon, where he sees himself
          as an individual among an infinite number of other individuals,
          accordingly as something very insignificant, nay, vanishing
          altogether. Consequently every individual, even the most
          insignificant, every I, when regarded from within, is all in all;
          regarded from without, on the other hand, he is nothing, or at
          least as good as nothing. Hence upon this depends the great
          difference between what each one necessarily is in his own eyes and
          what he is in the eyes of others, consequently the egoism with
          which every one reproaches every one else.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In consequence
          of this egoism our fundamental error of all is this, that with
          reference to each other we are reciprocally not I. On the other
          hand, to be just, noble, and benevolent is nothing else than to
          translate my metaphysics into actions. To say that time and space
          are mere forms of our knowledge, not conditions of things in
          themselves, is the same as to say that the doctrine of
          metempsychosis, <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou shalt one day be born
          as him whom thou now injurest, and in thy turn shalt suffer like
          injury,”</span> is identical with the formula of the Brahmans,
          which has frequently been mentioned, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Tat twam
          asi</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“This thou art.”</span>
          All true virtue proceeds from the immediate and intuitive knowledge
          of the metaphysical identity of all beings, which I have frequently
          shown, especially in § 22 of my prize essay on the foundation of
          morals. But just on this account it is not the result of a special
          pre-eminence of intellect; on the contrary, even the weakest
          intellect is sufficient to see through the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium individuationis</span></span>,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page418">[pg 418]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg418"></a> which is what is
          required in this matter. Accordingly we may find the most excellent
          character even in the case of a very weak understanding. And
          further, the excitement of our sympathy is accompanied by no
          exertion of our intellect. It rather appears that the requisite
          penetration of the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium
          individuationis</span></span> would be present in every one if it
          were not that the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em> opposes this, and by virtue
          of its immediate mysterious and despotic influence upon the
          intellect generally prevents it from arising; so that ultimately
          all guilt falls back upon the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em>, as indeed is in conformity
          with the fact.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The doctrine of
          metempsychosis, touched on above, deviates from the truth merely
          through the circumstance that it transfers to the future what
          already is now. It makes my true inner nature exist in others only
          after my death, while, according to the truth, it already lives in
          them now, and death merely removes the illusion on account of which
          I am not aware of this; just as an innumerable host of stars
          constantly shine above our heads, but only become visible to us
          when the one sun near the earth has set. From this point of view my
          individual existence, however much, like that sun, it may outshine
          everything, appears ultimately only as a hindrance which stands
          between me and the knowledge of the true extent of my being. And
          because every individual, in his knowledge, is subject to this
          hindrance, it is just individuation that keeps the will to live in
          error as to its own nature; it is the Mâyâ of Brahmanism. Death is
          a refutation of this error, and abolishes it. I believe that at the
          moment of death we become conscious that it is a mere illusion that
          has limited our existence to our person. Indeed empirical traces of
          this may be found in several states which are related to death by
          the abolition of the concentration of consciousness in the brain,
          among which the magnetic sleep is the most prominent; for in it, if
          it reaches a high degree, our existence shows itself through
          various symptoms, beyond our persons and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page419">[pg 419]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg419"></a> in other beings, most strikingly by direct
          participation in the thoughts of another individual, and ultimately
          even by the power of knowing the absent, the distant, and even the
          future, thus by a kind of omnipresence.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Upon this
          metaphysical identity of the will, as the thing in itself, in the
          infinite multiplicity of its phenomena, three principal phenomena
          depend, which may be included under the common name of sympathies:
          (1) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sympathy proper</span></em>, which, as I have
          shown, is the basis of justice and benevolence, <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">caritas</span></span>; (2) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sexual
          love</span></em>, with capricious selection, <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">amor</span></span>, which is the life of the
          species, that asserts its precedence over that of the individual;
          (3) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">magic</span></em>, to which animal magnetism
          and sympathetic cures also belong. Accordingly <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sympathy</span></em> may be defined as the
          empirical appearance of the metaphysical identity of the will,
          through the physical multiplicity of its phenomena, whereby a
          connection shows itself which is entirely different from that
          brought about by means of the forms of the phenomenon which we
          comprehend under the principle of sufficient reason.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Man has his
          existence and being either <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">with</span></em> his will, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          his consent, or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">without</span></em> this; in the latter case
          an existence so embittered by manifold and insupportable sufferings
          would be a flagrant injustice. The ancients, especially the Stoics,
          also the Peripatetics and Academics, strove in vain to prove that
          virtue sufficed to make life happy. Experience cried out loudly
          against it. What really lay at the foundation of the efforts of
          these philosophers, although they were not distinctly conscious of
          it, was the assumed <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">justice</span></em> of the thing; whoever was
          without guilt ought to be free from suffering, thus happy. But the
          serious and profound solution of the problem lies in the Christian
          doctrine that works do not justify. Accordingly a man, even if he
          has practised all justice and benevolence, consequently the αγαθον,
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">honestum</span></span>, is yet not, as Cicero
          imagines, <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">culpa omni
          carens</span></span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tusc.</span></span>, v. i.); but <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="es"><span style="font-style: italic">el delito mayor del hombre es haber
          nacido</span></span> (the greatest guilt of man is that he was
          born), as Calderon, illuminated by Christianity, has expressed it
          with far profounder knowledge than these wise men. Therefore that
          man comes into the world already tainted with guilt can appear
          absurd only to him who regards him as just then having arisen out
          of nothing and as the work of another. In consequence of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em>
          guilt, then, which must therefore have proceeded <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page421">[pg 421]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg421"></a> from his will, man remains rightly
          exposed to physical and mental suffering, even if he has practised
          all those virtues, thus is not happy. This follows from the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">eternal
          justice</span></em> of which I have spoken in § 63 of the first
          volume. That, however, as St. Paul (Rom. iii. 21), Augustine, and
          Luther teach, works cannot justify, inasmuch as we all are and
          remain essentially sinners, ultimately rests upon the fact that,
          because <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">operari sequitur
          esse</span></span>, if we acted as we ought, we would necessarily
          be as we ought. But then we would require no <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">salvation</span></em> from our present
          condition, which not only Christianity but also Brahmanism and
          Buddhism (under the name which is expressed in English by
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">final
          emancipation</span></em>) present as the highest goal, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          we would not need to become something quite different from, nay,
          the very opposite of what we are. Since, however, we are what we
          ought not to be, we also necessarily do what we ought not to do.
          Therefore we need a complete transformation of our mind and nature;
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the new birth, as the
          result of which salvation appears. Although the guilt lies in
          action, <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">operari</span></span>, yet
          the root of the guilt lies in our <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">essentia et existentia</span></span>, for out
          of these the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">operari</span></span>
          necessarily proceeds, as I have shown in the prize essay on the
          freedom of the will. Accordingly our one true sin is really
          original sin. Now the Christian myth makes original sin first arise
          after man came into existence, and for this purpose ascribes to
          him, <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">per
          impossibile</span></span>, a free will. It does this, however,
          simply as myth. The inmost kernel and spirit of Christianity is
          identical with that of Brahmanism and Buddhism; they all teach a
          great guilt of the human race through its existence itself, only
          that Christianity does not proceed directly and frankly like these
          more ancient religions: thus does not make the guilt simply the
          result of existence itself, but makes it arise through the act of
          the first human pair. This was only possible under the fiction of a
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">liberum arbitrium indifferentiæ</span></span>,
          and only necessary on account of the Jewish fundamental dogma, in
          which that doctrine had <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page422">[pg
          422]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg422"></a>
          here to be implanted. Because, according to the truth, the coming
          into existence of man himself is the act of his free will, and
          accordingly one with the fall, and therefore the original sin, of
          which all other sins are the result, appeared already with the
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">essentia</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">existentia</span></span> of man; but the
          fundamental dogma of Judaism did not admit of such an explanation.
          Thus Augustine taught, in his books <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De libero
          arbitrio</span></span>, that only as Adam before the fall was man
          guiltless and possessed of a free will, but for ever after is
          involved in the necessity of sin. The law, ὁ νομος, in the Biblical
          sense, always demands that we shall change our doing, while our
          being remains unchanged. But because this is impossible, Paul says
          that no man is justified by the law; only the new birth in Jesus
          Christ, in consequence of the work of grace, on account of which a
          new man arises and the old man is abolished (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, a
          fundamental change of mind or conversion), can transfer us from the
          state of sinfulness into that of freedom and salvation. This is the
          Christian myth with reference to ethics. But certainly the Jewish
          theism, upon which it was grafted, must have received wonderful
          additions to adapt itself to that myth. In it the fable of the fall
          presented the only place for the graft of the old Indian stem. It
          is to be attributed just to that forcibly surmounted difficulty
          that the Christian mysteries have received such an extraordinary
          appearance, conflicting with the ordinary understanding, which
          makes proselytising more difficult, and on account of which, from
          incapacity to comprehend their profound meaning, Pelagianism, or at
          the present day Rationalism, rises against them, and seeks to
          explain them away, but thereby reduces Christianity to Judaism.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But to speak
          without myth: so long as our will is the same, our world can be no
          other than it is. It is true all wish to be delivered from the
          state of suffering and death; they would like, as it is expressed,
          to attain to eternal blessedness, to enter the kingdom of heaven,
          only <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page423">[pg 423]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg423"></a> not upon their own
          feet; they would like to be carried there by the course of nature.
          That, however, is impossible. Therefore nature will never let us
          fall and become nothing; but yet it can lead us nowhere but always
          again into nature. Yet how questionable a thing it is to exist as a
          part of nature every one experiences in his own life and death.
          Accordingly existence is certainly to be regarded as an erring, to
          return from which is salvation: it also bears this character
          throughout. It is therefore conceived in this manner by the ancient
          Samana religions, and also, although indirectly, by real and
          original Christianity. Even Judaism itself contains at least in the
          fall (this its redeeming feature) the germ of such a view. Only
          Greek paganism and Islamism are entirely optimistic: therefore in
          the former the opposite tendency had to find expression at least in
          tragedy; but in Islamism, which is the worst, as it is the most
          modern, of all religions, it appeared as Sufism, that very
          beautiful phenomenon, which is completely of Indian spirit and
          origin, and has now continued for upwards of a thousand years.
          Nothing can, in fact, be given as the end of our existence but the
          knowledge that we had better not be. This, however, is the most
          important of all truths, which must therefore be expressed, however
          great the contrast in which it stands with the European manner of
          thought of the present day. On the other hand, in the whole of
          non-Mohammedan Asia it is the most universally recognised
          fundamental truth, to-day as much as three thousand years ago.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If now we
          consider the will to live as a whole and objectively, we have, in
          accordance with what has been said, to think of it as involved in
          an illusion, to escape from which, thus to deny its whole existing
          endeavour, is what all religions denote by self-renunciation,
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">abnegatio sui ipsius</span></span>; for the
          true self is the will to live. The moral virtues, thus justice and
          benevolence, since if they are pure they spring, as I have shown,
          from the fact that <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page424">[pg
          424]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg424"></a>
          the will to live, seeing through the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium individuationis</span></span>,
          recognises itself in all its manifestations, are accordingly
          primarily a sign, a symptom, that the self-manifesting will is no
          longer firmly held in that illusion, but the disillusion already
          begins to take place; so that one might metaphorically say it
          already flaps its wings to fly away from it. Conversely, injustice,
          wickedness, cruelty are signs of the opposite, thus of the deep
          entanglement in that illusion. Secondly, however, these virtues are
          a means of advancing self-renunciation, and accordingly the denial
          of the will to live. For true integrity, inviolable justice, this
          first and most important of cardinal virtues, is so hard a task
          that whoever professes it unconditionally and from the bottom of
          his heart has to make sacrifices that soon deprive life of the
          sweetness which is demanded to make it enjoyable, and thereby turn
          away the will from it, thus lead to resignation. Yet just what
          makes integrity honourable is the sacrifices which it costs; in
          trifles it is not admired. Its nature really consists in this, that
          the just man does not throw upon others, by craft or force, the
          burdens and sorrows which life brings with it, as the unjust man
          does, but bears himself what falls to his lot; and thus he has to
          bear the full burden of the evil imposed upon human life,
          undiminished. Justice thereby becomes a means of advancing the
          denial of the will to live, for want and suffering, those true
          conditions of human life, are its consequence, and these lead to
          resignation. Still more quickly does the virtue of benevolence,
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">caritas</span></span>, which goes further,
          lead to the same result; for on account of it one takes over even
          the sufferings which originally fell to the lot of others,
          therefore appropriates to oneself a larger share of these than in
          the course of things would come to the particular individual. He
          who is inspired with this virtue has recognised his own being in
          all others. And thereby he identifies his own lot with that of
          humanity in general; but this is a hard lot, that of care,
          suffering, and death. Whoever, then, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page425">[pg 425]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg425"></a> by renouncing every accidental advantage,
          desires for himself no other lot than that of humanity in general
          cannot desire even this long. The clinging to life and its
          pleasures must now soon yield, and give place to a universal
          renunciation; consequently the denial of the will will take place.
          Since now, in accordance with this, poverty, privation, and special
          sufferings of many kinds are introduced simply by the perfect
          exercise of the moral virtues, asceticism in the narrowest sense,
          thus the surrender of all possessions, the intentional seeking out
          of what is disagreeable and repulsive, self-mortification, fasts,
          the hair shirt, and the scourge—all this is rejected by many, and
          perhaps rightly, as superfluous. Justice itself is the hair shirt
          that constantly harasses its owner and the charity that gives away
          what is needed, provides constant fasts.<a href="#note_45" id="noteref_45" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">45</span></span></a> Just
          on this account Buddhism is free from all strict and excessive
          asceticism, which plays a large part in Brahmanism, thus from
          intentional self-mortification. It rests satisfied with the
          celibacy, voluntary poverty, humility, and obedience of the monks,
          with abstention from animal food, as also from all worldliness.
          Since, further, the goal to which the moral virtues lead is that
          which is here pointed out, the Vedanta philosophy<a href="#note_46" id="noteref_46" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">46</span></span></a>
          rightly says that after the entrance of true knowledge, with entire
          resignation in its train, thus the new birth, then the morality or
          immorality of the past life is a matter of indifference, and uses
          here also the saying so often quoted by the Brahmans: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Finditur nodus cordis,
          dissolvuntur omnes dubitationes, ejusque opera evanescunt, viso
          supremo illo</span></span>”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sancara, sloca
          32</span></span>).</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page426">[pg
          426]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg426"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now, however
          objectionable this view may be to many, to whom a reward in heaven
          or a punishment in hell is a much more satisfactory explanation of
          the ethical significance of human action, just as the good
          Windischmann rejects that doctrine, while he expounds it, yet
          whoever is able to go to the bottom of the matter will find that in
          the end it agrees with that Christian doctrine especially urged by
          Luther, that it is not works but only the faith which enters
          through the work of grace, that saves us, and that therefore we can
          never be justified by our deeds, but can only obtain the
          forgiveness of our sins through the merits of the Mediator. It is
          indeed easy to see that without such assumptions Christianity would
          have to teach infinite punishment for all, and Brahmanism endless
          re-births for all, thus no salvation would be reached by either.
          The sinful works and their consequences must be annulled and
          annihilated, whether by extraneous pardon or by the entrance of a
          better knowledge; otherwise the world could hope for no salvation;
          afterwards, however, they become a matter of indifference. This is
          also the μετανοια και αφεσις ἁμαρτιων, the announcement of which
          the risen Christ exclusively imposes upon His Apostles as the sum
          of their mission (Luke xxiv. 47). The moral virtues are really not
          the ultimate end, but only a step towards it. This step is
          signified in the Christian myth by the eating of the tree of the
          knowledge of good and evil, with which moral responsibility enters,
          together with original sin. The latter itself is in truth the
          assertion of the will to live: the denial of the will to live, in
          consequence of the appearance of a better knowledge, is, on the
          other hand, salvation. Between these two, then, lies the sphere of
          morality; it accompanies man as a light upon his path from the
          assertion to the denial of the will, or, mythically, from original
          sin to salvation through faith in the mediation of the incarnate
          God (Avatar); or, according to the teaching of the Vedas, through
          all re-births, which are the consequence of the works in each case,
          until right knowledge <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page427">[pg
          427]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg427"></a>
          appears, and with it salvation (final emancipation), Mokscha,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, reunion with Brahma. The
          Buddhists, however, with perfect honesty, only indicate the matter
          negatively, by Nirvana, which is the negation of this world, or of
          Sansara. If Nirvana is defined as nothing, this only means that the
          Sansara contains no single element which could assist the
          definition or construction of Nirvana. Just on this account the
          Jainas, who differ from the Buddhists only in name, call the
          Brahmans who believe in the Vedas Sabdapramans, a nickname which is
          meant to signify that they believe upon hearsay what cannot be
          known or proved (<span class="tei tei-q">“Asiat.
          Researches,”</span> vol. vi. P. 474).</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When certain
          ancient philosophers, such as Orpheus, the Pythagoreans, and Plato
          (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span>, in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Phædo,”</span> pp. 151, 183 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">seq.</span></span>,
          Bip.; and see <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Clem. Alex. strom.</span></span>, iii. p. 400
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">seq.</span></span>), just like the Apostle
          Paul, lament the union of soul and body, and desire to be freed
          from it, we understand the real and true meaning of this complaint,
          since we have recognised, in the second book, that the body is the
          will itself, objectively perceived as a phenomenon in space.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the hour of
          death it is decided whether the man returns into the womb of nature
          or belongs no more to nature at all, but —— —— ——: for this
          opposite we lack image, conception, and word, just because these
          are all taken from the objectification of the will, therefore
          belong to this, and consequently can in no way express the absolute
          opposite of it, which accordingly remains for us a mere negation.
          However, the death of the individual is in each case the
          unweariedly repeated question of nature to the will to live,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Hast thou enough? Wilt thou escape from
          me?”</span> In order that it may occur often enough, the individual
          life is so short. In this spirit are conceived the ceremonies,
          prayers, and exhortations of the Brahmans at the time of death, as
          we find them preserved in the Upanischad in several places; and so
          also are the Christian provisions for the suitable employment of
          the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page428">[pg 428]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg428"></a> hour of death by
          means of exhortation, confession, communion, and extreme unction:
          hence also the Christian prayers for deliverance from sudden death.
          That at the present day it is just this that many desire only
          proves that they no longer stand at the Christian point of view,
          which is that of the denial of the will to live, but at that of its
          assertion, which is the heathen point of view.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But he will fear
          least to become nothing in death who has recognised that he is
          already nothing now, and who consequently no longer takes any share
          in his individual phenomenon, because in him knowledge has, as it
          were, burnt up and consumed the will, so that no will, thus no
          desire for individual existence, remains in him any more.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Individuality
          inheres indeed primarily in the intellect; and the intellect,
          reflecting the phenomenon, belongs to the phenomenon, which has the
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium individuationis</span></span> as
          its form. But it inheres also in the will, inasmuch as the
          character is individual: yet the character itself is abolished in
          the denial of the will. Thus individuality inheres in the will only
          in its assertion, not in its denial. Even the holiness which is
          connected with every purely moral action depends upon the fact that
          such an action ultimately springs from the immediate knowledge of
          the numerical identity of the inner nature of all living
          things.<a href="#note_47" id="noteref_47" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">47</span></span></a> But
          this identity only really exists in the condition of the denial of
          the will (Nirvana), for the assertion of the will (Sansara) has for
          its form the phenomenal appearance of it in multiplicity. Assertion
          of the will to live, the phenomenal world, the diversity of all
          beings, individuality, egoism, hatred, wickedness, all spring from
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> root; and so also, on the
          other hand, do the world as thing in itself, the identity of all
          beings, justice, benevolence, the denial of the will to live. If
          now, as I have sufficiently proved, even the moral virtues spring
          from the consciousness of that identity of all beings, but this
          lies, not in the phenomenon, but only in the thing in itself, in
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page429">[pg 429]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg429"></a> the root of all
          beings, the moral action is a momentary passing through the point,
          the permanent return to which is the denial of the will to
          live.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It follows, as a
          deduction from what has been said, that we have no ground to assume
          that there are more perfect intelligences than that of human
          beings. For we see that even this degree of intelligence is
          sufficient to impart to the will that knowledge in consequence of
          which it denies and abolishes itself, upon which the individuality,
          and consequently the intelligence, which is merely a tool of
          individual, and therefore animal nature, perish. This will appear
          to us less open to objection if we consider that we cannot conceive
          even the most perfect intelligences possible, which for this end we
          may experimentally assume, existing through an endless time, which
          would be much too poor to afford them constantly new objects worthy
          of them. Because the nature of all things is at bottom one, all
          knowledge of them is necessarily tautological. If now this nature
          once becomes comprehended, as by those most perfect intelligences
          it soon would be comprehended, what would then remain but the
          wearisomeness of mere repetition through an infinite time? Thus
          from this side also we are pointed to the fact that the end of all
          intelligence can only be reaction upon the will; since, however,
          all willing is an error, it remains the last work of intelligence
          to abolish the willing, whose ends it had hitherto served.
          Accordingly even the most perfect intelligence possible can only be
          a transition step to that to which no knowledge can ever extend:
          indeed such an intelligence can, in the nature of things, only
          assume the position of the moment of the attainment of perfect
          insight.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In agreement
          with all these considerations, and also with what is proved in the
          second book as to the origin of knowledge in the will, the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">assertion</span></em> of which it reflects in
          fulfilling the sole function of knowledge, that of being
          serviceable to the ends of the will, while true salvation
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page430">[pg 430]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg430"></a> lies in its
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">denial</span></em>, we see all religions at
          their highest point pass over into mysticism and mysteries,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, into darkness and veiled
          obscurity, which for knowledge signify merely an empty spot, the
          point where knowledge necessarily ceases; therefore for thought
          this can only be expressed by negations, but for sense perception
          it is indicated by symbolical signs; in temples by dim light and
          silence; in Brahmanism indeed by the required suspension of all
          thought and perception for the sake of sinking oneself profoundly
          in the grounds of one's own being, mentally pronouncing the
          mysterious Oum.<a href="#note_48" id="noteref_48" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">48</span></span></a>
          Mysticism in the widest sense is every guidance to the immediate
          consciousness of that to which neither perception nor conception,
          thus in general no knowledge extends. The mystic is thus opposed to
          the philosopher by the fact that he begins from within, while the
          philosopher begins from without. The mystic starts from his inner,
          positive, individual experience, in which he finds himself to be
          the eternal and only being, &amp;c. But nothing of this is
          communicable except the assertions which one has to accept upon his
          word; consequently he cannot convince. The philosopher, on the
          other hand, starts from what is common to all, from the objective
          phenomenon which lies before all, and from the facts of
          consciousness as they are present in all. His method is therefore
          reflection upon all <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page431">[pg
          431]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg431"></a>
          this, and combination of the data given in it: accordingly he can
          convince. He ought therefore to beware of falling into the way of
          the mystics, and, for example, by the assertion of intellectual
          intuitions or pretended immediate apprehensions of the reason, to
          seek to make a vain show of positive knowledge of that which is for
          ever inaccessible to all knowledge, or at the most can be indicated
          by means of a negation. The value and worth of philosophy lies in
          the fact that it rejects all assumptions which cannot be
          established, and takes as its data only what can be certainly
          proved in the world given in external perception, in the forms of
          apprehension of this world, which are constitutive of our
          intellect, and in the consciousness of one's own self which is
          common to all. Therefore it must remain cosmology, and cannot
          become theology. Its theme must limit itself to the world; to
          express in all aspects what this <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></em>,
          what it is in its inmost nature, is all that it can honestly
          achieve. Now it answers to this that my system when it reaches its
          highest point assumes a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">negative</span></em> character, thus ends with
          a negation. It can here speak only of what is denied, given up: but
          what is thereby won, what is laid hold of, it is obliged (at the
          conclusion of the fourth book) to denote as nothing, and can only
          add the consolation that it is merely a relative, not an absolute
          nothing. For if something is none of all the things which we know,
          it is certainly for us, speaking generally, nothing. But it does
          not yet follow from this that it is absolutely nothing, that from
          every possible point of view and in every possible sense it must be
          nothing, but only that we are limited to a completely negative
          knowledge of it, which may very well lie in the limitation of our
          point of view. Now it is just here that the mystic proceeds
          positively, and therefore it is just from this point that nothing
          but mysticism remains. However, any one who wishes this kind of
          supplement to the negative knowledge to which alone philosophy can
          guide him will find it in its most beautiful and richest form
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page432">[pg 432]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg432"></a> in the Oupnekhat,
          then also in the Enneads of Plotinus, in Scotus Erigena, in
          passages of Jakob Böhm, but especially in the marvellous work of
          Madame de Guion, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Les Torrens</span></span>, and in Angelus
          Silesius; finally also in the poems of the Sufis, of which Tholuk
          has given us a collection translated into Latin, and another
          translated into German, and in many other works. The Sufis are the
          Gnostics of Islam. Hence Sadi denotes them by a word which may be
          translated <span class="tei tei-q">“full of insight.”</span>
          Theism, calculated with reference to the capacity of the multitude,
          places the source of existence without us, as an object. All
          mysticism, and so also Sufism, according to the various degrees of
          its initiation, draws it gradually back within us, as the subject,
          and the adept recognises at last with wonder and delight that he is
          it himself. This procedure, common to all mysticism, we find not
          only expressed by Meister Eckhard, the father of German mysticism,
          in the form of a precept for the perfect ascetic, <span class="tei tei-q">“that he seek not God outside himself”</span>
          (Eckhard's works, edited by Pfeiffer, vol. i. p. 626), but also
          very naïvely exhibited by Eckhard's spiritual daughter, who sought
          him out, when she had experienced that conversion in herself, to
          cry out joyfully to him, <span class="tei tei-q">“Sir, rejoice with
          me, I have become God”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">loc.
          cit.</span></span>, p. 465). The mysticism of the Sufis also
          expresses itself throughout precisely in accordance with this
          spirit, principally as a revelling in the consciousness that one is
          oneself the kernel of the world and the source of all existence, to
          which all returns. Certainly there also often appears the call to
          surrender all volition as the only way in which deliverance from
          individual existence and its suffering is possible, yet
          subordinated and required as something easy. In the mysticism of
          the Hindus, on the other hand, the latter side comes out much more
          strongly, and in Christian mysticism it is quite predominant, so
          that pantheistic consciousness, which is essential to all
          mysticism, here only appears in a secondary manner, in consequence
          of the surrender of all volition, as union with <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page433">[pg 433]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg433"></a> God. Corresponding to this difference
          of the conception, Mohammedan mysticism has a very serene
          character, Christian mysticism a gloomy and melancholy character,
          while that of the Hindus, standing above both, in this respect also
          holds the mean.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Quietism,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, surrender of all volition,

          consciousness of the identity of one's own nature with that of all
          things or with the kernel of the world, stand in the closest
          connection; so that whoever professes one of them is gradually led
          to accept the others, even against his intention. Nothing can be
          more surprising than the agreement with each other of the writers
          who present these doctrines, notwithstanding the greatest
          difference of their age, country, and religion, accompanied by the
          firm certainty and inward confidence with which they set forth the
          permanence of their inner experience. They do not constitute a
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sect</span></em>, which adheres to, defends,
          and propagates a favourite dogma once laid hold of; indeed the
          Indian, Christian, and Mohammedan mystics, quietists, and ascetics
          are different in every respect, except the inner significance and
          spirit of their teaching. A very striking example of this is
          afforded by the comparison of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Torrens</span></span>
          of Madame de Guion with the teaching of the Vedas, especially with
          the passage in the Oupnekhat, vol. i. p. 63, which contains the
          content of that French work in the briefest form, but accurately
          and even with the same images, and yet could not possibly have been
          known to Madame de Guion in 1680. In the <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Deutschen Theologie</span></span>”</span> (the
          only unmutilated edition, Stuttgart, 1851) it is said in chapters 2
          and 3 that both the fall of the devil and that of Adam consisted in
          the fact that the one as the other ascribed to himself the I and
          me, the mine and to me, and on p. 89 it is said: <span class="tei tei-q">“In true love there remains neither I nor me, mine, to
          me, thou, thine, and the like.”</span> Now, corresponding to this,
          it is said in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Kural,”</span> from the
          Tamilian by Graul, p. 8: <span class="tei tei-q">“The passion of
          the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page434">[pg 434]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg434"></a> mine directed
          outwardly, and that of the I directed inwardly, cease”</span>
          (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">cf.</span></span> ver. 346). And in the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Manual of Buddhism”</span> by Spence
          Hardy, p. 258, Buddha says: <span class="tei tei-q">“My disciples
          reject the thoughts I am this, or this is mine.”</span> In general,
          if we look away from the forms which are introduced by external
          circumstances and go to the bottom of the matter, we will find that
          Sakya Muni and Meister Eckhard teach the same; only that the former
          dared to express his thoughts directly, while the latter is obliged
          to clothe them in the garments of the Christian myth and adapt his
          expressions to this. He carries this, however, so far that with him
          the Christian myth has become little more than a symbolical
          language, just as the Hellenic myth became for the Neo-Platonists:
          he takes it throughout allegorically. In the same respect it is
          worth noticing that the transition of St. Francis from prosperity
          to the mendicant life is similar to the still greater step of
          Buddha Sakya Muni from prince to beggar, and that, corresponding to
          this, the life of St. Francis, and also the order he founded, was
          just a kind of Sannyasiism. Indeed it deserves to be mentioned that
          his relationship with the Indian spirit appears also in his great
          love for the brutes and frequent intercourse with them, when he
          always calls them his sisters and brothers; and his beautiful
          Cantico also bears witness to his inborn Indian spirit by the
          praise of the sun, the moon, the stars, the wind, the water, the
          fire, and the earth.<a href="#note_49" id="noteref_49" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">49</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Even the
          Christian quietists must often have had little or no knowledge of
          each other; for example, Molinos and Madame de Guion of Tauler and
          the <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Deutsche Theologie</span></span>,”</span> or
          Gichtel of the former. In any case, the great difference of their
          culture, in that some of them, like Molinos, were learned, others,
          like Gichtel and many more, were the reverse, has no essential
          influence upon their teaching. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page435">[pg 435]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg435"></a> Their great internal agreement, along with
          the firmness and certainty of their utterances, proves all the more
          that they speak from real inward experience, from an experience
          which certainly is not accessible to all, but is possessed only by
          a few favoured individuals, and therefore has received the name of
          the work of grace, the reality of which, however, for the above
          reasons, is not to be doubted. But in order to understand all this
          one must read the mystics themselves, and not be contented with
          second-hand reports of them; for every one must himself be
          comprehended before one judges concerning him. Thus to become
          acquainted with quietism I specially recommend Meister Eckhard, the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Deutsche Theologie</span></span>,”</span>
          Tauler, Madame de Guion, Antoinette Bourignon, the English Bunyan,
          Molinos<a href="#note_50" id="noteref_50" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">50</span></span></a> and
          Gichtel. In the same way, as practical proofs and examples of the
          profound seriousness of asceticism, the life of Pascal, edited by
          Reuchlin, together with his history of the Port-Royal, and also the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Histoire
          de Sainte Elisabeth, par le comte de Montalembert</span></span>,
          and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">La
          vie de Rancé, par Chateaubriand</span></span>, are very well worth
          reading, but yet by no means exhaust all that is important in this
          class. Whoever has read such writings, and compared their spirit
          with that of ascetism and quietism as it runs through all works of
          Brahmanism and Buddhism, and speaks in every page, will admit that
          every philosophy, which must in consistency reject that whole mode
          of thought, which it can only do by explaining the representatives
          of it to be either impostors or mad-men, must just on this account
          necessarily be false. But all European systems, with the exception
          of mine, find themselves in this position. Truly it must be an
          extraordinary madness which, under the most widely different
          circumstances and persons possible, spoke with such agreement,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page436">[pg 436]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg436"></a> and, moreover, was
          raised to the position of a chief doctrine of their religion, by
          the most ancient and numerous peoples of the earth, something like
          three-fourths of all the inhabitants of Asia. But no philosophy can
          leave the theme of quietism and asceticism undecided if the
          question is proposed to it; because this theme is, in its matter,
          identical with that of all metaphysics and ethics. Here then is a
          point upon which I expect and desire that every philosophy, with
          its optimism, should declare itself. And if, in the judgment of
          contemporaries, the paradoxical and unexampled agreement of my
          philosophy with quietism and asceticism appears as an open
          stumbling-block, I, on the contrary, see just in that agreement a
          proof of its sole correctness and truth, and also a ground of
          explanation of why it is ignored and kept secret by the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Protestant</span></em> universities.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For not only the
          religions of the East, but also true Christianity, has throughout
          that ascetic fundamental character which my philosophy explains as
          the denial of the will to live; although Protestantism, especially
          in its present form, seeks to conceal this. Yet even the open
          enemies of Christianity who have appeared in the most recent times
          have ascribed to it the doctrines of renunciation, self-denial,
          perfect chastity, and, in general, mortification of the will, which
          they quite correctly denote by the name of the <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">anti-cosmic tendency</span></em>,”</span> and
          have fully proved that such doctrines are essentially proper to
          original and genuine Christianity. In this they are undeniably
          right. But that they set up this as an evident and patent reproach
          to Christianity, while just here lies its profoundest truth, its
          high value, and its sublime character,—this shows an obscuring of
          the mind, which can only be explained by the fact that these men's
          minds, unfortunately like thousands more at the present day in
          Germany, are completely spoiled and distorted by the miserable
          Hegelism, that school of dulness, that centre of misunderstanding
          and ignorance, that mind-destroying, spurious wisdom, which now at
          last begins to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page437">[pg

          be recognised as such, and the veneration of which will soon be
          left to the Danish Academy, in whose eyes even that gross charlatan
          is a <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">summus

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In any case, the
          ascetic tendency is unmistakable in the genuine and original
          Christianity as it developed in the writings of the Church Fathers
          from its kernel in the New Testament; it is the summit towards
          which all strives upwards. As its chief doctrine we find the
          recommendation of genuine and pure celibacy (this first and most
          important step in the denial of the will to live), which is already
          expressed in the New Testament.<a href="#note_51" id="noteref_51" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">51</span></span></a>
          Strauss also, in his <span class="tei tei-q">“Life of Jesus”</span>
          (vol i. p. 618 of the first edition), says, with reference to the
          recommendation of celibacy given in Matt. xix. 11 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">seq.</span></span>,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“That the doctrine of Jesus may not run
          counter to the ideas of the present day, men have hastened to
          introduce surreptitiously the thought that Jesus only praised
          celibacy with reference to the circumstances of the time, and in
          order to leave the activity of the Apostles unfettered; but there
          is even less indication of this in the context than in the kindred
          passage, 1 Cor. vii. 25 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">seq.</span></span>; but we have here again one
          of the places where <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ascetic principles</span></em>, such as
          prevailed among the Essenes, and probably still more widely among
          the Jews, appear in the teaching of Jesus also.”</span> This
          ascetic tendency appears more decidedly later than at the
          beginning, when Christianity, still seeking adherents, dared not
          pitch its demands too high; and by the beginning of the third
          century it is expressly urged. Marriage, in genuine Christianity,
          is merely a compromise with the sinful nature of man, as a
          concession, something allowed to those who lack <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page438">[pg 438]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg438"></a> strength to aspire to the highest, an
          expedient to avoid greater evil: in this sense it receives the
          sanction of the Church in order that the bond may be indissoluble.
          But celibacy and virginity are set up as the higher consecration of
          Christianity through which one enters the ranks of the elect.
          Through these alone does one attain the victor's crown, which even
          at the present day is signified by the wreath upon the coffin of
          the unmarried, and also by that which the bride lays aside on the
          day of her marriage.</p>

          evidence upon this point, which certainly comes to us from the
          primitive times of Christianity, is the pregnant answer of the
          Lord, quoted by Clemens Alexandrinus (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Strom.</span></span>
          iii. 6 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">et</span></span> 9) from the Gospel of the
          Egyptians: <span class="tei tei-q">“Τῃ Σαλωμῃ ὁ κυριος πυνθανομενῃ,
          μεχρι ποτε θανατος ισχυσει; μεχρις αν ειπεν, ὑμεις, αἱ γυναικες,
          τικτετε”</span> (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Salomæ interroganti</span>
<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-style: italic">quousque
          vigebit mors?</span></span><span style="font-style: italic">Dominus</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-style: italic">guoadlusque</span></span> <span style="font-style: italic">inguit</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-style: italic">vos, mulieres,
          paritis</span></span></span>). <span class="tei tei-q">“Τουτ᾽ εστι,
          μεχρις αν αἱ επιθυμιαι ενεργωσι”</span> (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Hoc est, quamdiu operabuntur
          cupiditates</span></span>), adds Clement, c. 9, with which he at
          once connects the famous passage, Rom. v. 12. Further on, c. 13, he
          quotes the words of Cassianus: <span class="tei tei-q">“Πυνθανομενης της Σαλωμης, ποτε γνωσθησεται τα περι ὡν
          ηρετο, εφη ὁ κυριος, ᾽Οταν της αισχυνς ενδυμα πατησετε, και ὁταν
          γενηται τα δυο ἑν, και το αρρεν μετα της θηλειας ουτε αρρεν, ουτε
          θηλυ”</span> (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Cum interrogaret Salome,
          quando cognoscentur ea, de quibus interrogabat, ait Dominus:</span>
<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-style: italic">quando
          pudoris indumentum conculcaveritis, et quando duo facto fuerint
          unum, et masculum cum fæmina nec masculum, nec
          fæminium</span></span></span>), <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          when she no longer needs the veil of modesty, since all distinction
          of sex will have disappeared.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With regard to
          this point the heretics have certainly gone furthest: even in the
          second century the Tatianites or Encratites, the Gnostics, the
          Marcionites, the Montanists, Valentinians, and Cassians; yet only
          because with reckless consistency they gave honour to the truth,
          and therefore, in accordance with the spirit of Christianity, they
          taught perfect continence; while the Church prudently declared to
          be <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page439">[pg 439]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg439"></a> heresy all that ran
          counter to its far-seeing policy. Augustine says of the Tatianites:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Nuptias damnant,
          atque omnino pares eas fornicationibus aliisque corruptionibus
          faciunt: nec recipiunt in suum numerum conjugio utentem, sive
          marem, sive fœminam. Non vescunlur carnibus, easque
          abominantur.</span></span>”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De hœresi ad quod
          vult Deum. hœr.</span></span>, 25.) But even the orthodox Fathers
          look upon marriage in the light indicated above, and zealously
          preach entire continence, the ἁγνεια. Athanasius gives as the cause
          of marriage: <span class="tei tei-q">“Ὁτι υποπιπτοντες εσμεν τῃ του
          προπατορος καταδικῃ ... επειδη ὁ προηγουμενος σκοπος του θεου ην,
          το μη δια γαμου γενεσθαι ἡμας και φθορας; ἡ δε παραβασις της
          εντολης του γαμον εισηγαγεν δια το ανομησαι τον Αδαμ.”</span>
          (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Quia subjacemus condemnationi propatoris
          nostri; ... nam finis, a Deo prœlatus, erat, nos non per nuptias et
          corruptionem fieri: sed transgressio mandati nuptias introduxit,
          propter legis violationem Adœ.</span></span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Exposit. in
          psalm.</span></span> 50). Tertullian calls marriage <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">genus mali inferioris, ex indulgentia
          ortum</span></span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De pudicitia</span></span>, c. 16) and says:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Matrimonium et
          stuprum est commixtio carnis; scilicet cujus concupiscentiam
          dominus stupro adœquavit. Ergo, inguis, jam et primas, id est unas
          nuptias destruis? Nec immerito: quoniam et ipsœ ex eo constant,
          quod est stuprum</span></span>”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De exhort.
          castit.</span></span>, c. 9). Indeed, Augustine himself commits
          himself entirely to this doctrine and all its results, for he says:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Novi quosdam, qui
          murmurent: quid, si, inquiunt, omnes velint ab omni concubitu
          abstinere, unde subsistet genus humanum? Utinam omnes hoc vellent!
          dumtaxat in caritate, de corde puro et conscientia bona, et fide
          non ficta: multo citius Dei civitas compleretur, ut acceleraretur
          terminus mundi</span></span>”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De bono
          conjugali</span></span>, c. 10). And again: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Non vos ab hoc studio, quo
          multos ad imitandum vos excitatis, frangat querela vanorum, qui
          dicunt: quomodo subsistet genus humanum, si omnes fuerint
          continentes? Quasi propter aliud retardetur hoc seculum, nisi ut
          impleatur prœdestinatus numerus ille sanctorum, quo citius impleto,
          profecto nec terminus seculi differetur</span></span>”</span>
          (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De bono
          individuitatis</span></span>, c. 23). <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page440">[pg 440]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg440"></a> One sees at once that he identifies salvation
          with the end of the world. The other passages in the works of
          Augustine which bear on this point will be found collected in the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Confessio Augustiniana e D. Augustini operibus
          compilata a Hieronymo Torrense</span></span>,”</span> 1610, under
          the headings <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De matrimonio</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De
          cœlibatu</span></span>, &amp;c., and any one may convince himself
          from these that in ancient, genuine Christianity marriage was only
          a concession, which besides this was supposed to have only the
          begetting of children as its end, that, on the other hand, perfect
          continence was the true virtue far to be preferred to this. To
          those, however, who do not wish to go back to the authorities
          themselves I recommend two works for the purpose of removing any
          kind of doubt as to the tendency of Christianity we are speaking
          about: Carové, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ueber das
          Cölibatgesetz</span></span>,”</span> 1832, and Lind, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De cœlibatu Christianorum per tria priora
          secula</span></span>,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Havniœ</span></span>, 1839. It is, however, by
          no means the views of these writers themselves to which I refer,
          for these are opposed to mine, but solely to their carefully
          collected accounts and quotations, which deserve full acceptance as
          quite trustworthy, just because both these writers are opponents of
          celibacy, the former a rationalistic Catholic, and the other a
          Protestant candidate in theology, who speaks exactly like one. In
          the first-named work we find, vol. i. p. 166, in that reference,
          the following result expressed: <span class="tei tei-q">“In
          accordance with the Church view, as it may be read in canonical
          Church Fathers, in the Synodal and Papal instructions, and in
          innumerable writings of orthodox Catholics, perpetual chastity is
          called a divine, heavenly, angelic virtue, and the obtaining of the
          assistance of divine grace for this end is made dependent upon
          earnest prayer. We have already shown that this Augustinian
          doctrine is by Canisius and in the decrees of the Council of Trent
          expressed as an unchanging belief of the Church. That, however, it
          has been retained as a dogma till the present day is sufficiently
          established by the June number, 1831, of the magazine <span class="tei tei-q">‘<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Der Katholik</span></span>.’</span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page441">[pg 441]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg441"></a> It is said there, p.
          263: <span class="tei tei-q">‘In Catholicism the observance of a
          perpetual chastity, for the sake of God, appears as in itself the
          highest merit of man. The view that the observance of continual
          chastity as an end in itself sanctifies and exalts the man is, as
          every instructed Catholic is convinced, deeply rooted in
          Christianity, both as regards its spirit and its express precepts.
          The decrees of the Council of Trent have abolished all possible
          doubt on this point....’</span> It must at any rate be confessed by
          every unprejudiced person, not only that the doctrine expressed by
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Der Katholik</span></span>’</span> is really
          Catholic, but also that the proofs adduced may be quite irrefutable
          for a Catholic reason, because they are drawn so directly from the
          ecclesiastical view, taken by the Church, of life and its
          destiny.”</span> It is further said in the same work, p. 270:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Although both Paul calls the forbidding to
          marry a false doctrine, and the still Judaistic author of the
          Epistle to the Hebrews enjoins that marriage shall be held in
          honour by all, and the bed kept undefiled (Heb. xiii 4), yet the
          main tendency of these two sacred writers is not on that account to
          be mistaken. Virginity is for both the perfect state, marriage only
          a make-shift for the weak, and only as such to be held inviolable.
          The highest effort, on the other hand, was directed to complete,
          material putting off of self. The self must turn and refrain from
          all that tends only to its own pleasure, and that only
          temporarily.”</span> Lastly, p. 288: <span class="tei tei-q">“We
          agree with the Abbé Zaccaria, who asserts that celibacy (not the
          law of celibacy) is before everything to be deduced from the
          teaching of Christ and the Apostle Paul.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What is opposed
          to this specially Christian view is everywhere and always merely
          the Old Testament, with its παντα καλα λιαν. This appears with
          peculiar distinctness from that important third book of the
          Stromata of Clement, where, arguing against the encratistic
          heretics mentioned above, he constantly opposes to them only
          Judaism, with its optimistic history of creation, with which
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page442">[pg 442]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg442"></a> the world-denying
          tendency of the New Testament is certainly in contradiction. But
          the connection of the New Testament with the Old is at bottom only
          external, accidental, and forced; and the one point at which
          Christian doctrine can link itself on to the latter is only to be
          found, as has been said, in the story of the fall, which, moreover,
          stands quite isolated in the Old Testament, and is made no further
          use of. But, in accordance with the account in the Gospels, it is
          just the orthodox adherents of the Old Testament who bring about
          the crucifixion of the founder of Christianity, because they find
          his teaching in conflict with their own. In the said third book of
          the Stromata of Clement the antagonism between optimism with theism
          on the one hand, and pessimism with ascetic morality on the other,
          comes out with surprising distinctness. This book is directed
          against the Gnostics, who just taught pessimism and asceticism,
          that is, εγκρατεια (abstinence of every kind, but especially from
          all sexual satisfaction); on account of which Clement censures them
          vigorously. But, at the same time, it becomes apparent that even
          the spirit of the Old Testament stands in this antagonism with that
          of the New Testament. For, apart from the fall, which appears in
          the Old Testament like a <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">hors
          d'œuvre</span></span>, the spirit of the Old Testament is
          diametrically opposed to that of the New Testament—the former
          optimistic, the latter pessimistic. Clement himself brings this
          contradiction out prominently at the end of the eleventh chapter
          (προσαποτεινομενον τον Παυλον τῳ Κριστῃ κ.τ.λ.), although he will
          not allow that it is a real contradiction, but explains it as only
          apparent,—like a good Jew, as he is. In general it is interesting
          to see how with Clement the New and the Old Testament get mixed up
          together; and he strives to reconcile them, yet for the most part
          drives out the New Testament with the Old. Just at the beginning of
          the third chapter he objects to the Marcionites that they find
          fault with the creation, after the example of Plato and Pythagoras;
          for Marcion teaches <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page443">[pg
          443]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg443"></a>
          that nature is bad, made out of bad materials (φυσις κακη, εκ τε
          ὑλης κακης); therefore one ought not to people this world, but to
          abstain from marriage (μη βουλομενοι τον κοσμον συμπληρουν,
          απεχεσθαι γαμου). Now Clement, to whom in general the Old Testament
          is much more congenial and convincing than the New, takes this very
          much amiss. He sees in it their flagrant ingratitude to and enmity
          and rebellion against him who has made the world, the just
          demiurgus, whose work they themselves are, and yet despise the use
          of his creatures, in impious rebellion <span class="tei tei-q">“forsaking the natural opinion”</span> (αντιτασσομενοι
          τῳ ποιητῃ τῳ σφων, ... εγκρατεις τῃ προς τον πεποιηκοτα εχθρᾳ, μη
          βουλομενοι χρησθαι τοις ὑπ᾽ αυτου κτισθεισιν, ... ασεβει θεομαχιᾳ
          των κατα φυσιν εκσταντες λογισμωι). At the same time, in his holy
          zeal, he will not allow the Marcionites even the honour of
          originality, but, armed with his well-known erudition, he brings it
          against them, and supports his case with the most beautiful
          quotations, that even the ancient philosophers, that Heraclitus and
          Empedocles, Pythagoras and Plato, Orpheus and Pindar, Herodotus and
          Euripides, and also the Sibyls, lamented deeply the wretched nature
          of the world, thus taught pessimism. Now in this learned enthusiasm
          he does not observe that in this way he is just giving the
          Marcionites water for their mill, for he shows that</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-top: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-right: 3.60em; margin-bottom: 1.80em">

</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">have taught and
          sung what they do, but confidently and boldly he quotes the most
          decided and energetic utterances of the ancients in this sense.
          Certainly they cannot lead him astray. Wise men may mourn the
          sadness of existence, poets may pour out the most affecting
          lamentations about it, nature and experience may cry out as loudly
          as they will against optimism,—all this does not touch our Church
          Father: he holds his Jewish revelation in his hand, and remains
          confident. The demiurgus made the world. From this it is
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span> certain that it is
          excellent, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page444">[pg
          444]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg444"></a>
          and it may look as it likes. The same thing then takes place with
          regard to the second point, the εγκρατεια, through which, according
          to his view, the Marcionites show their ingratitude towards the
          demiurgus (αχαρισειν τῳ δημιουργῳ) and the perversity with which
          they put from them all his gifts (δἰ αντιταξιν προς τον δημιουργον,
          την χρησιν των κοσμικων παραιτουμενοι). Here now the tragic poets
          have preceded the Encratites (to the prejudice of their
          originality) and have said the same things. For since they also
          lament the infinite misery of existence, they have added that it is
          better to bring no children into such a world; which he now again
          supports with the most beautiful passages, and, at the same time,
          accuses the Pythagoreans of having renounced sexual pleasure on
          this ground. But all this touches him not; he sticks to his
          principle that all these sin against the demiurgus, in that they
          teach that one ought not to marry, ought not to beget children,
          ought not to bring new miserable beings into the world, ought not
          to provide new food for death (δἰ εγκρατειας ασεβουσι εις τε την
          κτισιν και τον ἁγιον δημιουργον, τον παντοκρατορα μονον θεον, και
          διδασκουσι, μη δειν παραδεχεσθαι γαμον και παιδοποιϊαν, μηδε
          αντεισαγειν τῳ κοσμῳ δυστυχησοντας ἑτερους, μηδε επιχορηγειν θανατῳ
          τροφην—c. 6). Since the learned Church Father thus denounces
          εγκρατεια, he seems to have had no presentiment that just after his
          time the celibacy of the Christian priesthood would be more and
          more introduced, and finally, in the eleventh century, raised to
          the position of a law, because it is in keeping with the spirit of
          the New Testament. It is just this spirit which the Gnostics have
          grasped more profoundly and understood better than our Church
          Father, who is more Jew than Christian. The conception of the
          Gnostics comes out very clearly at the beginning of the ninth
          chapter, where the following passage is quoted from the Gospel of
          the Egyptians: Αυτος ειπεν ὁ Σωτηρ, <span class="tei tei-q">“ηλθον
          καταλυσαι τα εργα της θηλειας;”</span> θηλειας μεν, της επιθυμιας;
          εργα δε, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page445">[pg
          445]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg445"></a>
          γενεσιν και φθοραν (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Ajunt enim dixisse
          Servatorem:</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-style: italic">veni ad dissolvendum opera
          feminæ;</span></span> <span style="font-style: italic">feminæ
          quidem, cupiditatis; opera autem, generationem et
          interitum</span></span>); but quite specially at the end of the
          thirteenth and the beginning of the fourteenth chapter. The Church
          certainly was obliged to consider how to set a religion upon its
          legs that could also walk and stand in the world as it is, and
          among men; therefore it declared these persons to be heretics. At
          the conclusion of the seventh chapter our Church Father opposes
          Indian asceticism, as bad, to Christian Judaism; whereby the
          fundamental difference of the spirit of the two religions is
          clearly brought out. In Judaism and Christianity everything runs
          back to obedience or disobedience to the command of God: ὑπακοη και
          παρακοη; as befits us creatures, ἡμιν, τοις πεπλασμενοις ὑπο της
          του Παντοκρατορος βουλησεως (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">nobis, qui Omnipotentis voluntate efficti
          sumus</span></span>), chap. 14. Then comes, as a second duty,
          λατρευειν θεῳ ζωντι, to serve God, extol His works, and overflow
          with thankfulness. Certainly the matter has a very different aspect
          in Brahmanism and Buddhism, for in the latter all improvement and
          conversion, and the only deliverance we can hope for from this
          world of suffering, this Sansara, proceeds from the knowledge of
          the four fundamental truths: (1) <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">dolor</span></span>; (2) <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">doloris ortus</span></span>; (3) <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">doloris interitus</span></span>; (4)
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">octopartita via ad doloris
          sedationem</span></span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dammapadam</span></span>, ed. Fausböll, p. 35
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">et</span></span> 347). The explanation of
          these four truths will be found in Bournouf, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Introduct. à l'hist. du
          Buddhisme</span></span>,”</span> p. 629, and in all expositions of
          Buddhism.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In truth,
          Judaism, with its παντα καλα λιαν, is not related to Christianity
          as regards its spirit and ethical tendency, but Brahmanism and
          Buddhism are. But the spirit and ethical tendency are what is
          essential in a religion, not the myths in which these are clothed.
          I therefore cannot give up the belief that the doctrines of
          Christianity can in some way be derived from these primitive
          religions. I have pointed out some traces of this in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page446">[pg 446]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg446"></a> the second volume of the Parerga, § 179
          (second edition, § 180). I have to add to these that Epiphanias
          (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hæretic</span></span>. xviii.) relates that
          the first Jewish Christians of Jerusalem, who called themselves
          Nazarenes, refrained from all animal food. On account of this
          origin (or, at least, this agreement) Christianity belongs to the
          ancient, true and sublime faith of mankind, which is opposed to the
          false, shallow, and injurious optimism which exhibits itself in
          Greek paganism, Judaism, and Islamism. The Zend religion holds to a
          certain extent the mean, because it has opposed to Ormuzd a
          pessimistic counterpoise in Ahriman. From this Zend religion the
          Jewish religion proceeded, as J.G. Rhode has thoroughly proved in
          his book, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Die heilige Sage des
          Zendvolks</span></span>;”</span> from Ormuzd has come Jehovah, and
          from Ahriman, Satan, who, however, plays only a very subordinate
          rôle in Judaism, indeed almost entirely disappears, whereby then
          optimism gains the upper hand, and there only remains the myth of
          the fall as a pessimistic element, which certainly (as the fable of
          Meschia and Meschiane) is derived from the Zend-Avesta. Yet even
          this falls into oblivion, till it is again taken up by Christianity
          along with Satan. Ormuzd himself, however, is derived from
          Brahmanism, although from a lower region of it; he is no other than
          Indra, that subordinate god of the firmament and the atmosphere,
          who is represented as frequently in rivalry with men. This has been
          very clearly shown by J.J. Schmidt in his work on the relation of
          the Gnostic-theosophic doctrines to the religions of the East. This
          Indra-Ormuzd-Jehovah had afterwards to pass over into Christianity,
          because this religion arose in Judæa. But on account of the
          cosmopolitan character of Christianity he laid aside his own name
          to be denoted in the language of each converted nation by the
          appellation of the superhuman beings he supplanted, as, Δεος,
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Deus</span></span>, which comes from the
          Sanscrit <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Deva</span></span> (from which also devil
          comes), or among the Gothico-Germanic peoples by the word God,
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">Gott</span></span>, which comes from
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">Odin</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">Wodan</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Guodan</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Godan</span></span>. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page447">[pg 447]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg447"></a> In the same way he assumed in Islamism, which
          also sprang from Judaism, the name of Allah, which also existed
          earlier in Arabia. Analogous to this, the gods of the Greek
          Olympus, when in prehistoric times they were transplanted to Italy,
          also assumed the names of the previously reigning gods: hence among
          the Romans Zeus is called Jupiter, Hera Juno, Hermes Mercury,
          &amp;c. In China the first difficulty of the missionaries arose
          from the fact that the Chinese language has no appellation of the
          kind and also no word for creating; for the three religions of
          China know no gods either in the plural or in the singular.<a href="#note_52" id="noteref_52" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">52</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">However the rest
          may be, that παντα καλα λιαν of the Old Testament is really foreign
          to true Christianity; for in the New Testament the world is always
          spoken of as something to which one does not belong, which one does
          not love, nay, whose lord is the devil.<a href="#note_53" id="noteref_53" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">53</span></span></a> This
          agrees with the ascetic spirit of the denial of one's self and the
          overcoming of the world which, just like the boundless love of
          one's neighbour, even of one's enemy, is the fundamental
          characteristic which Christianity has in common with Brahmanism and
          Buddhism, and which proves their relationship. There is nothing in
          which one has to distinguish the kernel so carefully from the shell
          as in Christianity. Just because I prize this kernel highly I
          sometimes treat the shell with little ceremony; it is, however,
          thicker than is generally supposed. Protestantism, since it has
          eliminated asceticism and its <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page448">[pg 448]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg448"></a> central point, the meritoriousness of
          celibacy, has already given up the inmost kernel of Christianity,
          and so far is to be regarded as a falling away from it. This has
          become apparent in our own day by the gradual transition of
          Protestantism into shallow rationalism, this modern Pelagianism,
          which ultimately degenerates into the doctrine of a loving father,
          who has made the world, in order that things may go on very
          pleasantly in it (in which case, then, he must certainly have
          failed), and who, if one only conforms to his will in certain
          respects, will also afterwards provide a still more beautiful world
          (with regard to which it is only a pity that it has such a fatal
          entrance). That may be a good religion for comfortable, married,
          and enlightened Protestant pastors; but it is no Christianity.
          Christianity is the doctrine of the deep guilt of the human race
          through its existence alone, and the longing of the heart for
          deliverance from it, which, however, can only be attained by the
          greatest sacrifices and by the denial of one's own self, thus by an
          entire reversal of human nature. Luther may have been perfectly
          right from the practical point of view, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          with reference to the Church scandal of his time, which he wished
          to remove, but not so from the theoretical point of view. The more
          sublime a doctrine is, the more it is exposed to abuse at the hands
          of human nature, which, on the whole, is of a low and evil
          disposition: hence the abuses of Catholicism are so much more
          numerous and so much greater than those of Protestantism. Thus, for
          example, monasticism, that methodical denial of the will practised
          in common for the sake of mutual encouragement, is an institution
          of a sublime description, which, however, for this very reason is
          for the most part untrue to its spirit. The shocking abuses of the
          Church excited in the honest mind of Luther a lofty indignation.
          But in consequence of this he was led to desire to limit as much as
          possible the claims of Christianity itself, and for this end he
          first <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page449">[pg 449]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg449"></a> confined it to the
          words of the Bible; but then, in his well-meant zeal, he went too
          far, for he attacked the very heart of Christianity in the ascetic
          principle. For after the withdrawal of the ascetic principle, the
          optimistic principle soon necessarily took its place. But in
          religions, as in philosophy, optimism is a fundamental error which
          obstructs the path of all truth. From all this it seems to me that
          Catholicism is a shamefully abused, but Protestantism a degenerate
          Christianity; thus, that Christianity in general has met the fate
          which befalls all that is noble, sublime, and great whenever it has
          to dwell among men.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">However, even in
          the very lap of Protestantism, the essentially ascetic and
          encratistic spirit of Christianity has made way for itself; and in
          this case it has appeared in a phenomenon which perhaps has never
          before been equalled in magnitude and definiteness, the highly
          remarkable sect of the Shakers, in North America, founded by an
          Englishwoman, Anne Lee, in 1774. The adherents of this sect have
          already increased to 6000, who are divided into fifteen
          communities, and inhabit a number of villages in the states of New
          York and Kentucky, especially in the district of New Lebanon, near
          Nassau village. The fundamental characteristic of their religious
          rule of life is celibacy and entire abstention from all sexual
          satisfaction. It is unanimously admitted, even by the English and
          Americans who visit them, and who laugh and jeer at them in every
          other respect, that this rule is strictly and with perfect honesty
          observed; although brothers and sisters sometimes even occupy the
          same house, eat at the same table, nay, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dance</span></em>
          together in the religious services in church. For whoever has made
          that hardest of all sacrifices may <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dance</span></em>
          before the Lord; he is a victor, he has overcome. Their singing in
          church consists in general of cheerful, and partly even of merry,
          songs. The church-dance, also, which follows the sermon is
          accompanied by the singing of the rest. It is a lively dance,
          performed in measured time, and concludes with a galop, which is
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page450">[pg 450]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg450"></a> carried on till the
          dancers are exhausted. Between each dance one of their teachers
          cries aloud, <span class="tei tei-q">“Think, that ye rejoice before
          the Lord for having slain your flesh; for this is here the only use
          we make of our refractory limbs.”</span> To celibacy most of the
          other conditions link themselves on of themselves. There are no
          families, and therefore there is no private property, but community
          of goods. All are clothed alike, in Quaker fashion, and with great
          neatness. They are industrious and diligent: idleness is not
          endured. They have also the enviable rule that they are to avoid
          all unnecessary noise, such as shouting, door-slamming,
          whip-cracking, loud knocking, &amp;c. Their rule of life has been
          thus expressed by one of them: <span class="tei tei-q">“Lead a life
          of innocence and purity, love your neighbours as yourself, live at
          peace with all men, and refrain from war, blood-shed, and all
          violence against others, as well as from all striving after worldly
          honour and distinction. Give to each his own, and follow after
          holiness, without which no man can see the Lord. Do good to all so
          far as your opportunity and your power extends.”</span> They
          persuade no one to join them, but test those who present themselves
          by a novitiate of several years. Moreover, every one is free to
          leave them; very rarely is any one expelled for misconduct. Adopted
          children are carefully educated, and only when they are grown up do
          they voluntarily join the sect. It is said that in the
          controversies of their ministers with Anglican clergy the latter
          generally come off the worse, for the arguments consist of passages
          from the New Testament. Fuller accounts of them will be found
          particularly in Maxwell's <span class="tei tei-q">“Run through the
          United States,”</span> 1841; also in Benedict's <span class="tei tei-q">“History of all Religions,”</span> 1830; also in the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Times</span></span>, November 4, 1837, and in
          the German magazine <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Columbus</span></span>, May number, 1831. A
          German sect in America, very similar to them, who also live in
          strict celibacy and continence, are the Rappists. An account of
          them is given in F. Loher's <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Geschichte und
          Zustande der Deutschen in Amerika</span></span>,”</span> 1853.
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page451">[pg 451]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg451"></a> In Russia also the
          Raskolniks are a similar sect. The Gichtelians live also in strict
          chastity. But among the ancient Jews we already find a prototype of
          all these sects, the Essenes, of whom even Pliny gives an account
          (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hist.
          Nat.</span></span>, v. 15), and who resembled the Shakers very
          much, not only in celibacy, but also in other respects; for
          example, in dancing during divine service, which leads to the
          opinion that the founder of the Shakers took the Essenes as a
          pattern. In the presence of such facts as these how does Luther's
          assertion look: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Ubi natura, quemadmodum a Deo nobis insita
          est, fertur ac rapitur</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">fieri nullo
          modo potest</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ut extra matrimonium
          caste vivatur</span></span>”</span>? (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Catech.
          maj.</span></span>)</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Although
          Christianity, in essential respects, taught only what all Asia knew
          long before, and even better, yet for Europe it was a new and great
          revelation, in consequence of which the spiritual tendency of the
          European nations was therefore entirely transformed. For it
          disclosed to them the metaphysical significance of existence, and
          therefore taught them to look away from the narrow, paltry,
          ephemeral life of earth, and to regard it no longer as an end in
          itself, but as a condition of suffering, guilt, trial, conflict,
          and purification, out of which, by means of moral achievements,
          difficult renunciation, and denial of oneself, one may rise to a
          better existence, which is inconceivable by us. It taught the great
          truth of the assertion and denial of the will to live in the
          clothing of allegory by saying that through Adam's fall the curse
          has come upon all, sin has come into the world, and guilt is
          inherited by all; but that, on the other hand, through the
          sacrificial death of Jesus all are reconciled, the world saved,
          guilt abolished, and justice satisfied. In order, however, to
          understand the truth itself that is contained in this myth one must
          not regard men simply in time, as beings independent of each other,
          but must comprehend the (Platonic) Idea of man, which is related to
          the series of men, as eternity in itself is related to eternity
          drawn out as time; <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page452">[pg
          452]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg452"></a>
          hence the eternal Idea <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">man</span></em> extended in time to the series
          of men through the connecting bond of generation appears again in
          time as a whole. If now we keep the Idea of man in view, we see
          that Adam's fall represents the finite, animal, sinful nature of
          man, in respect of which he is a finite being, exposed to sin,
          suffering, and death. On the other hand, the life, teaching, and
          death of Jesus Christ represent the eternal, supernatural side, the
          freedom, the salvation of man. Now every man, as such and
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">potentiâ</span></span>, is both Adam and
          Jesus, according as he comprehends himself, and his will thereupon
          determines him; in consequence of which he is then condemned and
          given over to death, or saved and attains to eternal life. Now
          these truths, both in their allegorical and in their real
          acceptation, were completely new as far as Greeks and Romans were
          concerned, who were still entirely absorbed in life, and did not
          seriously look beyond it. Let whoever doubts this see how Cicero
          (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pro
          Cluentio</span></span>, c. 61) and Sallust (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Catil.</span></span>,
          c. 47) speak of the state after death. The ancients, although far
          advanced in almost everything else, remained children with regard
          to the chief concern, and were surpassed in this even by the
          Druids, who at least taught metempsychosis. That one or two
          philosophers, like Pythagoras and Plato, thought otherwise alters
          nothing as regards the whole.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That great
          fundamental truth, then, which is contained in Christianity, as in
          Brahmanism and Buddhism, the need of deliverance from an existence
          which is given up to suffering and death, and the attainableness of
          this by the denial of the will, thus by a decided opposition to
          nature, is beyond all comparison the most important truth there can
          be; but, at the same time, it is entirely opposed to the natural
          tendency of the human race, and in its true grounds it is difficult
          to comprehend; as indeed all that can only be thought generally and
          in the abstract is inaccessible to the great majority of men.
          Therefore for these men there was everywhere required, in order to
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page453">[pg 453]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg453"></a> bring that great
          truth within the sphere of its practical application, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a mythical
          vehicle</span></em> for it, as it were a receptacle, without which
          it would be lost and dissipated. The truth had therefore everywhere
          to borrow the garb of the fable, and also constantly to endeavour
          to connect itself with what in each case was historically given,
          already familiar, and already revered. What <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">sensu proprio</span></span> remained
          inaccessible to the great mass of mankind of all ages and lands,
          with their low tone of mind, their intellectual stupidity and
          general brutality, had, for practical purposes, to be brought home
          to them <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">sensu
          allegorico</span></span>, in order to become their guiding star.
          So, then, the religions mentioned above are to be regarded as the
          sacred vessels in which the great truth, known and expressed for
          several thousand years, indeed perhaps since the beginning of the
          human race, which yet in itself, for the great mass of mankind
          always remains a mystery, is, according to the measure of their
          powers, made accessible to them, preserved and transmitted through
          the centuries. Yet, because all that does not through and through
          consist of the imperishable material of pure truth is subject to
          destruction, whenever this fate befalls such a vessel, through
          contact with a heterogeneous age, its sacred content must in some
          way be saved and preserved for mankind by another. But it is the
          task of philosophy, since it is one with pure truth, to present
          that content pure and unmixed, thus merely in abstract conceptions,
          and consequently without that vehicle, for those who are capable of
          thinking, who are always an exceedingly small number. It is
          therefore related to religions as a straight line to several curves
          running near it: for it expresses <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">sensu proprio</span></span>, thus reaches
          directly, what they show in veiled forms and reach by circuitous
          routes.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If now, in order
          to illustrate what has just been said by an example, and also to
          follow a philosophical fashion of my time, I should wish perhaps to
          attempt to solve the profoundest mystery of Christianity, that of
          the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page454">[pg 454]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg454"></a> Trinity, in the
          fundamental conception of my philosophy, this could be done, with
          the licence permitted in such interpretations, in the following
          manner. The Holy Ghost is the distinct denial of the will to live:
          the man in whom this exhibits itself <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">in
          concreto</span></span> is the Son; He is identical with the will
          which asserts life, and thereby produces the phenomenon of this
          perceptible world, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, with the Father, because
          the assertion and denial are opposite acts of the same will whose
          capability for both is the only true freedom. However, this is to
          be regarded as a mere <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">lusus
          ingenii</span></span>.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before I close
          this chapter I wish to adduce a few proofs in support of what in §
          68 of the first volume I denoted by the expression Δευτυρος πλους,
          the bringing about of the denial of the will by one's own deeply
          felt suffering, thus not merely by the appropriation of the
          suffering of others, and the knowledge of the vanity and
          wretchedness of our existence introduced by this. We can arrive at
          a comprehension of what goes on in the heart of a man, in the case
          of an elevation of this kind and the accompanying purifying
          process, by considering what every emotional man experiences on
          beholding a tragedy, which is of kindred nature to this. In the
          third and fourth acts perhaps such a man is distressed and
          disturbed by the ever more clouded and threatened happiness of the
          hero; but when, in the fifth act, this happiness is entirely
          wrecked and shattered, he experiences a certain elevation of the
          soul, which affords him an infinitely higher kind of pleasure than
          the sight of the happiness of the hero, however great it might be,
          could ever have given. Now this is the same thing, in the weak
          water-colours of sympathy which is able to raise a well-known
          illusion, as that which takes place with the energy of reality in
          the feeling of our own fate when it is heavy misfortune that drives
          the man at last into the haven of entire resignation. Upon this
          occurrence depend all those conversions which completely transform
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page455">[pg 455]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg455"></a> men such as are
          described in the text. I may give here in a few words the story of
          the conversion of the Abbé Rancé, as it is strikingly similar to
          that of Raymond Lully, which is told in the text, and besides this
          is memorable on account of its result. His youth was devoted to
          enjoyment and pleasure; finally, he lived in a relation of passion
          with a Madame de Montbazon. One evening, when he visited her, he
          found her room empty, in disorder and darkness. He struck something
          with his foot; it was her head, which had been severed from the
          trunk, because after her sudden death her corpse could not
          otherwise be got into the lead coffin that stood beside it. After
          overcoming an immense sorrow, Rancé now became, in 1663, the
          reformer of the order of the Trappists, which at that time had
          entirely relaxed the strictness of its rules. He joined this order,
          and through him it was led back to that terrible degree of
          renunciation which is still maintained at the present day at La
          Trappe, and, as the methodically carried out denial of the will,
          aided by the severest renunciation and an incredibly hard and
          painful manner of life, fills the visitor with sacred awe, after he
          has been touched at his reception by the humility of these genuine
          monks, who, emaciated by fasting, by cold, by night watches,
          prayers and penances, kneel before him, the worldling and the
          sinner, to implore his blessing. Of all orders of monks, this one
          alone has maintained itself in perfection in France, through all
          changes; which is to be attributed to the profound earnestness
          which in it is unmistakable, and excludes all secondary ends. It
          has remained untouched even by the decline of religion, because its
          root lies deeper in human nature than any positive system of
          belief.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I have mentioned
          in the text that this great and rapid change of the inmost being of
          man which we are here considering, and which has hitherto been
          entirely neglected by philosophers, appears most frequently when,
          with full consciousness, he stands in the presence of a violent and
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page456">[pg 456]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg456"></a> certain death, thus
          in the case of executions. But, in order to bring this process much
          more distinctly before our eyes, I regard it as by no means
          unbecoming to the dignity of philosophy to quote what has been said
          by some criminals before their execution, even at the risk of
          incurring the sneer that I encourage gallows' sermons. I certainly
          rather believe that the gallows is a place of quite peculiar
          revelations, and a watch-tower from which the man who even then
          retains his presence of mind obtains a wider, clearer outlook into
          eternity than most philosophers over the paragraphs of their
          rational psychology and theology. The following speech on the
          gallows was made on the 15th April, 1837, at Gloucester, by a man
          called Bartlett, who had murdered his mother-in-law: <span class="tei tei-q">“Englishmen and fellow countrymen,—I have a few words
          to say to you, and they shall be but very few. Yet let me entreat
          you, one and all, that these few words that I shall utter may
          strike deep into your hearts. Bear them in your mind, not only now
          while you are witnessing this sad scene, but take them to your
          homes, take them, and repeat them to your children and friends. I
          implore you as a dying man—one for whom the instrument of death is
          even now prepared—and these words are that you may loose yourselves
          from the love of this dying world and its vain pleasures. Think
          less of it and more of your God. Do this: repent, repent, for be
          assured that without deep and true repentance, without turning to
          your heavenly Father, you will never attain, nor can hold the
          slightest hope of ever reaching those bowers of bliss to which I
          trust I am now fast advancing”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Times</span></span>,
          18th April 1837).</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Still more
          remarkable are the last words of the well-known murderer,
          Greenacre, who was executed in London on the 1st of May 1837. The
          English newspaper the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Post</span></span> gives the following
          account, which is also reprinted in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Galignani's
          Messenger</span></span> of the 6th of May 1837: <span class="tei tei-q">“On the morning of his execution a gentleman advised
          him to put his trust in God, and pray for forgiveness through the
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page457">[pg 457]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg457"></a> mediation of Jesus
          Christ. Greenacre replied that forgiveness through the mediation of
          Christ was a matter of opinion; for his part, he believed that in
          the sight of the highest Being, a Mohammedan was as good as a
          Christian and had just as much claim to salvation. Since his
          imprisonment he had had his attention directed to theological
          subjects, and he had become convinced that the gallows is a
          passport to heaven.”</span> The indifference displayed here towards
          positive religions is just what gives this utterance greater
          weight, for it shows that it is no fanatical delusion, but
          individual immediate knowledge that lies at its foundation. The
          following incident may also be mentioned which is given by
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Galignani's Messenger</span></span> of the
          15th August 1837, from the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Limerick Chronicle</span></span>: <span class="tei tei-q">“Last Monday Maria Cooney was executed for the
          revolting murder of Mrs. Anderson. So deeply was this wretched
          woman impressed with the greatness of her crime that she kissed the
          rope which was put round her neck, while she humbly implored the
          mercy of God.”</span> Lastly this: the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Times</span></span>,
          of the 29th April 1845 gives several letters which Hocker, who was
          condemned for the murder of Delarue, wrote the day before his
          execution. In one of these he says: <span class="tei tei-q">“I am
          persuaded that unless the natural heart be broken, and renewed by
          divine mercy, however noble and amiable it may be deemed by the
          world, it can never think of eternity without inwardly
          shuddering.”</span> These are the outlooks into eternity referred
          to above which are obtained from that watch-tower; and I have had
          the less hesitation in giving them here since Shakspeare also
          says—</p>

</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Strauss, in his
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Life of Jesus,”</span> has proved that
          Christianity also ascribes to suffering as such the purifying and
          sanctifying power here set forth (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Leben
          Jesu</span></span>, vol. i. ch. 6, §§ 72 and 74). He says that the
          beatitudes in the Sermon on the Mount have a different sense in
          Luke (vi. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page458">[pg
          458]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg458"></a>
          21) from that which they have in Matt. (v. 3), for only the latter
          adds τῳ πνευματι to μακαριοι οἱ πτωχοι, and την δικαιοσυνην to
          πεινωντες. Thus by him alone are the simple-minded, the humble,
          &amp;c., meant, while by Luke are meant the literally poor; so that
          here the contrast is that between present suffering and future
          happiness. With the Ebionites it is a capital principle that
          whoever takes his portion in this age gets nothing in the future,
          and conversely. Accordingly in Luke the blessings are followed by
          as many ουαι, woes, which are addressed to the rich, οἱ πλουσιοι,
          the full, οἱ εμπεπλησμενοι, and to them that laugh, οἱ γελωντες, in
          the Ebionite spirit. In the same spirit, he says, p. 604, is the
          parable (Luke xvi. 19) of the rich man and Lazarus given, which
          nowhere mentions any fault of the former or any merit of the
          latter, and takes as the standard of the future recompense, not the
          good done or the wickedness practised, but the evil suffered here
          and the good things enjoyed, in the Ebionite spirit. <span class="tei tei-q">“A like estimation of outward poverty,”</span> Strauss
          goes on, <span class="tei tei-q">“is also attributed to Jesus by
          the other synoptists (Matt. xix. 16; Mark x. 17; Luke xviii. 18),
          in the story of the rich young man and the saying about the camel
          and the eye of a needle.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If we go to the
          bottom of the matter we will recognise that even in the most famous
          passages of the Sermon on the Mount there is contained an indirect
          injunction to voluntary poverty, and thereby to the denial of the
          will to live. For the precept (Matt. v. 40 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">seq.</span></span>)
          to consent unconditionally to all demands made upon us, to give our
          cloak also to him who will take away our coat, &amp;c., similarly
          (Matt. vi. 25-34) the precept to cast aside all care for the
          future, even for the morrow, and so to live simply in the present,
          are rules of life the observance of which inevitably leads to
          absolute poverty, and which therefore just say in an indirect
          manner what Buddha directly commands his disciples and has
          confirmed by his own example: throw everything away and become
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page459">[pg 459]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg459"></a> bhikkhu,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, beggars. This appears
          still more decidedly in the passage Matt. x. 9-15, where all
          possessions, even shoes and a staff, are forbidden to the Apostles,
          and they are directed to beg. These commands afterwards became the
          foundation of the mendicant order of St. Francis (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bonaventuræ vita S.
          Francisci</span></span>, c. 3). Hence, then, I say that the spirit
          of Christian ethics is identical with that of Brahmanism and
          Buddhism. In conformity with the whole view expounded here Meister
          Eckhard also says (Works, vol. i. p. 492): <span class="tei tei-q">“The swiftest animal that bears thee to perfection is
          suffering.”</span></p>

          Salvation.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is only
          one inborn error, and that is, that we exist in order to be happy.
          It is inborn in us because it is one with our existence itself, and
          our whole being is only a paraphrase of it, nay, our body is its
          monogram. We are nothing more than will to live and the successive
          satisfaction of all our volitions is what we think in the
          conception of happiness.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As long as we
          persist in this inborn error, indeed even become rigidly fixed in
          it through optimistic dogmas, the world appears to us full of
          contradictions. For at every step, in great things as in small, we
          must experience that the world and life are by no means arranged
          with a view to containing a happy existence. While now by this the
          thoughtless man only finds himself tormented in reality, in the
          case of him who thinks there is added to his real pain the
          theoretical perplexity why a world and a life which exist in order
          that one may be happy in them answer their end so badly. First of
          all it finds expression in pious ejaculations, such as,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Ah! why are the tears on earth so
          many?”</span> &amp;c. &amp;c. But in their train come disquieting
          doubts about the assumptions of those preconceived optimistic
          dogmas. One may try if one will to throw the blame of one's
          individual unhappiness now upon the circumstances, now upon other
          men, now upon one's own bad luck, or even upon one's own
          awkwardness, and may know well how all these have worked together
          to produce it; but this in no way alters the result that one has
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page461">[pg 461]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg461"></a> missed the real end
          of life, which consists indeed in being happy. The consideration of
          this is, then, often very depressing, especially if life is already
          on the wane; hence the countenances of almost all elderly persons
          wear the expression of that which in English is called
          disappointment. Besides this, however, hitherto every day of our
          life has taught us that joys and pleasures, even if attained, are
          in themselves delusive, do not perform what they promise, do not
          satisfy the heart, and finally their possession is at least
          embittered by the disagreeables that accompany them or spring from
          them; while, on the contrary, the pains and sorrows prove
          themselves very real, and often exceed all expectation. Thus
          certainly everything in life is calculated to recall us from that
          original error, and to convince us that the end of our existence is
          not to be happy. Indeed, if we regard it more closely and without
          prejudice, life rather presents itself as specially intended to be
          such that we shall <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> feel ourselves happy in it,
          for through its whole nature it bears the character of something
          for which we have no taste, which must be endured by us, and from
          which we have to return as from an error that our heart may be
          cured of the passionate desire of enjoyment, nay, of life, and
          turned away from the world. In this sense, it would be more correct
          to place the end of life in our woe than in our welfare. For the
          considerations at the conclusion of the preceding chapter have
          shown that the more one suffers the sooner one attains to the true
          end of life, and that the more happily one lives the longer this is
          delayed. The conclusion of the last letter of Seneca corresponds
          with this: <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">bonum tunc habebis tuum, quum
          intelliges infelicissimos esse felices</span></span>; which
          certainly seems to show the influence of Christianity. The peculiar
          effect of the tragic drama also ultimately depends upon the fact
          that it shakes that inborn error by vividly presenting in a great
          and striking example the vanity of human effort and the nothingness
          of this whole existence, and thus discloses the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page462">[pg 462]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg462"></a> profound significance of life; hence it
          is recognised as the sublimest form of poetry. Whoever now has
          returned by one or other path from that error which dwells in us
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span>, that πρωτου ψευδος of
          our existence, will soon see all in another light, and will now
          find the world in harmony with his insight, although not with his
          wishes. Misfortunes of every kind and magnitude, although they pain
          him, will no longer surprise him, for he has come to see that it is
          just pain and trouble that tend towards the true end of life, the
          turning away of the will from it. This will give him indeed a
          wonderful composedness in all that may happen, similar to that with
          which a sick person who undergoes a long and painful cure bears the
          pain of it as a sign of its efficacy. In the whole of human
          existence suffering expresses itself clearly enough as its true
          destiny. Life is deeply sunk in suffering, and cannot escape from
          it; our entrance into it takes place amid tears, its course is at
          bottom always tragic, and its end still more so. There is an
          unmistakable appearance of intention in this. As a rule man's
          destiny passes through his mind in a striking manner, at the very
          summit of his desires and efforts, and thus his life receives a
          tragic tendency by virtue of which it is fitted to free him from
          the passionate desire of which every individual existence is an
          example, and bring him into such a condition that he parts with
          life without retaining a single desire for it and its pleasures.
          Suffering is, in fact, the purifying process through which alone,
          in most cases, the man is sanctified, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          is led back from the path of error of the will to live. In
          accordance with this, the salutary nature of the cross and of
          suffering is so often explained in Christian books of edification,
          and in general the cross, an instrument of suffering, not of doing,
          is very suitably the symbol of the Christian religion. Nay, even
          the Preacher, who is still Jewish, but so very philosophical,
          rightly says: <span class="tei tei-q">“Sorrow is better than
          laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made
          better”</span> (Eccles. vii. 3). Under <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page463">[pg 463]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg463"></a> the name of the δεντρος πλους I have
          presented suffering as to a certain extent a substitute for virtue
          and holiness; but here I must make the bold assertion that, taking
          everything into consideration, we have more to hope for our
          salvation and deliverance from what we suffer than from what we do.
          Precisely in this spirit Lamartine very beautifully says in his
          <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hymne à la douleur</span></span>,”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If, then,
          suffering itself has such a sanctifying power, this will belong in
          an even higher degree to death, which is more feared than any
          suffering. Answering to this, a certain awe, kindred to that which
          great suffering occasions us, is felt in the presence of every dead
          person, indeed every case of death presents itself to a certain
          extent as a kind of apotheosis or canonisation; therefore we cannot
          look upon the dead body of even the most insignificant man without
          awe, and indeed, extraordinary as the remark may sound in this
          place, in the presence of every corpse the watch goes under arms.
          Dying is certainly to be regarded as the real aim of life: in the
          moment of death all that is decided for which the whole course of
          life was only the preparation and introduction. Death is the
          result, the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">Résumé</span></span> of life,
          or the added up sum which expresses at once the instruction which
          life gave in detail, and bit by bit; this, that the whole striving
          whose manifestation is life was a vain, idle, and
          self-contradictory effort, to have returned from which is a
          deliverance. As the whole, slow vegetation of the plant is related
          to the fruit, which now at a stroke achieves a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page464">[pg 464]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg464"></a> hundredfold what the plant achieved
          gradually and bit by bit, so life, with its obstacles, deluded
          hopes, frustrated plans, and constant suffering, is related to
          death, which at one stroke destroys all, all that the man has
          willed, and so crowns the instruction which life gave him. The
          completed course of life upon which the dying man looks back has an
          effect upon the whole will that objectifies itself in this
          perishing individuality, analogous to that which a motive exercises
          upon the conduct of the man. It gives it a new direction, which
          accordingly is the moral and essential result of the life. Just
          because a sudden death makes this retrospect impossible, the Church
          regards such a death as a misfortune, and prays that it should be
          averted. Since this retrospect, like the distinct foreknowledge of
          death, as conditioned by the reason, is possible only in man, not
          in the brute, and accordingly man alone really drinks the cup of
          death, humanity is the only material in which the will can deny
          itself and entirely turn away from life. To the will that does not
          deny itself every birth imparts a new and different intellect,—till
          it has learned the true nature of life, and in consequence of this
          wills it no more.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the natural
          course, in age the decay of the body coincides with that of the
          will. The desire for pleasures soon vanishes with the capacity to
          enjoy them. The occasion of the most vehement willing, the focus of
          the will, the sexual impulse, is first extinguished, whereby the
          man is placed in a position which resembles the state of innocence
          which existed before the development of the genital system. The
          illusions, which set up chimeras as exceedingly desirable benefits,
          vanish, and the knowledge of the vanity of all earthly blessings
          takes their place. Selfishness is repressed by the love of one's
          children, by means of which the man already begins to live more in
          the ego of others than in his own, which now will soon be no more.
          This course of life is at least the desirable one; it is the
          euthanasia of the will. In hope of this the Brahman <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page465">[pg 465]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg465"></a> is ordered, after he has passed the
          best years of his life, to forsake possessions and family, and lead
          the life of a hermit (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Menu</span></span>, B. 6), But if, conversely,
          the desire outlives the capacity for enjoyment, and we now regret
          particular pleasures in life which we miss, instead of seeing the
          emptiness and vanity of all; and if then gold, the abstract
          representative of the objects of desire for which the sense is
          dead, takes the place of all these objects themselves, and now
          excites the same vehement passions which were formerly more
          pardonably awakened by the objects of actual pleasure, and thus now
          with deadened senses a lifeless but indestructible object is
          desired with equally indestructible eagerness; or, also, if, in the
          same way, existence in the opinion of others takes the place of
          existence and action in the real world, and now kindles the same
          passions;—then the will has become sublimated and etherealised into
          avarice or ambition; but has thereby thrown itself into the last
          fortress, in which it can only now be besieged by death. The end of
          existence has been missed.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All these
          considerations afford us a fuller explanation of that purification,
          conversion of the will and deliverance, denoted in the preceding
          chapter by the expression δευτερος πλους which is brought about by
          the suffering of life, and without doubt is the most frequent. For
          it is the way of sinners such as we all are. The other way, which
          leads to the same goal, by means of mere knowledge and the
          consequent appropriation of the suffering of a whole world, is the
          narrow path of the elect, the saints, and therefore to be regarded
          as a rare exception. Therefore without that first way for most of
          us there would be no salvation to hope for. However, we struggle
          against entering upon it, and strive rather to procure for
          ourselves a safe and agreeable existence, whereby we chain our will
          ever more firmly to life. The conduct of the ascetics is the
          opposite of this. They make their life intentionally as poor, hard,
          and empty of pleasure as possible, because <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page466">[pg 466]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg466"></a> they have their true and ultimate welfare in
          view. But fate and the course of things care for us better than we
          ourselves, for they frustrate on all sides our arrangements for an
          utopian life, the folly of which is evident enough from its
          brevity, uncertainty, and emptiness, and its conclusion by bitter
          death; they strew thorns upon thorns in our path, and meet us
          everywhere with healing sorrow, the panacea of our misery. What
          really gives its wonderful and ambiguous character to our life is
          this, that two diametrically opposite aims constantly cross each
          other in it; that of the individual will directed to chimerical
          happiness in an ephemeral, dream-like, and delusive existence, in
          which, with reference to the past, happiness and unhappiness are a
          matter of indifference, and the present is every moment becoming
          the past; and that of fate visibly enough directed to the
          destruction of our happiness, and thereby to the mortification of
          our will and the abolition of the illusion that holds us chained in
          the bonds of this world.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The prevalent
          and peculiarly Protestant view that the end of life lies solely and
          immediately in the moral virtues, thus in the practice of justice
          and benevolence, betrays its insufficiency even in the fact that so
          miserably little real and pure morality is found among men. I am
          not speaking at all of lofty virtue, nobleness, magnanimity, and
          self-sacrifice, which one hardly finds anywhere but in plays and
          novels, but only of those virtues which are the duty of every one.
          Let whoever is old think of all those with whom he has had to do;
          how many persons will he have met who were merely really and truly
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">honest</span></em>? Were not by far the
          greater number, in spite of their shameless indignation at the
          slightest suspicion of dishonesty or even untruthfulness, in plain
          words, the precise opposite? Were not abject selfishness, boundless
          avarice, well-concealed knavery, and also poisonous envy and
          fiendish delight in the misfortunes of others so universally
          prevalent that the slightest exception was met with <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page467">[pg 467]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg467"></a> surprise? And benevolence, how very
          rarely it extends beyond a gift of what is so superfluous that one
          never misses it. And is the whole end of existence to lie in such
          exceedingly rare and weak traces of morality? If we place it, on
          the contrary, in the entire reversal of this nature of ours (which
          bears the evil fruits just mentioned) brought about by suffering,
          the matter gains an appearance of probability and is brought into
          agreement with what actually lies before us. Life presents itself
          then as a purifying process, of which the purifying lye is pain. If
          the process is carried out, it leaves behind it the previous
          immorality and wickedness as refuse, and there appears what the
          Veda says: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Finditur nodus cordis, dissolvuntur omnes
          dubitationes, ejusque opera evanescunt.</span></span>”</span> As
          agreeing with this view the fifteenth sermon of Meister Eckhard
          will be found very well worth reading.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the
          conclusion of my exposition a few reflections concerning my
          philosophy itself may find their place. My philosophy does not
          pretend to explain the existence of the world in its ultimate
          grounds: it rather sticks to the facts of external and internal
          experience as they are accessible to every one, and shows the true
          and deepest connection of them without really going beyond them to
          any extra-mundane things and their relations to the world. It
          therefore arrives at no conclusions as to what lies beyond all
          possible experience, but affords merely an exposition of what is
          given in the external world and in self-consciousness, thus
          contents itself with comprehending the nature of the world in its
          inner connection with itself. It is consequently <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">immanent</span></em>, in the Kantian sense of
          the word. But just on this account it leaves many questions
          untouched; for example, why what is proved as a fact is as it is
          and not otherwise, &amp;c. All such questions, however, or rather
          the answers to them, are really transcendent, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          they cannot be thought by the forms and functions of our intellect,
          do not enter into these; it is therefore related to them as our
          sensibility is related to the possible properties of bodies for
          which we have no senses. After all my explanations one may still
          ask, for example, whence has sprung this will that is free to
          assert itself, the manifestation of which is the world, or to deny
          itself, the manifestation of which we do not know. What is the
          fatality lying beyond all experience which has placed it in the
          very doubtful dilemma of either appearing as a world in which
          suffering and death <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page469">[pg
          469]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg469"></a>
          reign, or else denying its very being?—or again, what can have
          prevailed upon it to forsake the infinitely preferable peace of
          blessed nothingness? An individual will, one may add, can only turn
          to its own destruction through error in the choice, thus through
          the fault of knowledge; but the will in itself, before all
          manifestation, consequently still without knowledge, how could it
          go astray and fall into the ruin of its present condition? Whence
          in general is the great discord that permeates this world? It may,
          further, be asked how deep into the true being of the world the
          roots of individuality go; to which it may certainly be answered:
          they go as deep as the assertion of the will to live; where the
          denial of the will appears they cease, for they have arisen with
          the assertion. But one might indeed even put the question,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“What would I be if I were not will to
          live?”</span> and more of the same kind. To all such questions we
          would first have to reply that the expression of the most universal
          and general form of our intellect is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">principle of
          sufficient reason</span></em>; but that just on this account that
          principle finds application only to the phenomenon, not to the
          being in itself of things. Yet all whence and why depend upon that
          principle alone. As a result of the Kantian philosophy it is no
          longer an <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">æterna veritas</span></span>,
          but merely the form, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the function, of our
          intellect, which is essentially cerebral, and originally a mere
          tool in the service of the will, which it therefore presupposes
          together with all its objectifications. But our whole knowing and
          conceiving is bound to its forms; accordingly we must conceive
          everything in time, consequently as a before and after, then as
          cause and effect, and also as above and below, whole and part,
          &amp;c., and cannot by any means escape from this sphere in which
          all possibility of our knowledge lies. Now these forms are utterly
          unsuited to the problems raised here, nor are they fit or able to
          comprehend their solution even if it were given. Therefore with our
          intellect, this mere tool of the will, we are everywhere striking
          upon insoluble problems, as against the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page470">[pg 470]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg470"></a> walls of our prison. But, besides this, it
          may at least be assumed as probable that not only <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">for us</span></em>
          is knowledge of all that has been asked about impossible, but no
          such knowledge is possible in general, thus never and in no way;
          that these relations are not only relatively but absolutely
          insusceptible of investigation; that not only does no one know
          them, but that they are in themselves unknowable, because they do
          not enter into the form of knowledge in general. (This corresponds
          to what Scotus Erigena says, <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">de
          mirabili divina ignorantia, qua Deus non intelligit quid ipse
          sit</span></span>. Lib. ii.) For knowableness in general, with its
          most essential, and therefore constantly necessary form of subject
          and object, belongs merely to the phenomenal appearance, not to the
          being in itself of things. Where knowledge, and consequently idea,
          is, there is also only phenomenon, and we stand there already in
          the province of the phenomenal; nay, knowledge in general is known
          to us only as a phenomenon of brain, and we are not only
          unjustified in conceiving it otherwise, but also incapable of doing
          so. What the world is as world may be understood: it is phenomenal
          manifestation; and we can know that which manifests itself in it,
          directly from ourselves, by means of a thorough analysis of
          self-consciousness. Then, however, by means of this key to the
          nature of the world, the whole phenomenal manifestation can be
          deciphered, as I believe I have succeeded in doing. But if we leave
          the world in order to answer the questions indicated above, we have
          also left the whole sphere in which, not only connection according
          to reason and consequent, but even knowledge itself is possible;
          then all is <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">instabilis tellus, innabilis
          unda</span></span>. The nature of things before or beyond the
          world, and consequently beyond the will, is open to no
          investigation; because knowledge in general is itself only a
          phenomenon, and therefore exists only in the world as the world
          exists only in it. The inner being in itself of things is nothing
          that knows, no intellect, but an unconscious; knowledge is
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page471">[pg 471]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg471"></a> only added as an
          accident, a means of assistance to the phenomenon of that inner
          being, and can therefore apprehend that being itself only in
          proportion to its own nature, which is designed with reference to
          quite different ends (those of the individual will), consequently
          very imperfectly. Here lies the reason why a perfect understanding
          of the existence, nature, and origin of the world, extending to its
          ultimate ground and satisfying all demands, is impossible. So much
          as to the limits of my philosophy, and indeed of all
          philosophy.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The ἑν και παν,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, that the inner nature in
          all things is absolutely one and the same, my age had already
          grasped and understood, after the Eleatics, Scotus Erigena,
          Giordano Bruno, and Spinoza had thoroughly taught, and Schelling
          had revived this doctrine. But <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">what</span></em>
          this one is, and how it is able to exhibit itself as the many, is a
          problem the solution of which is first found in my philosophy.
          Certainly from the most ancient times man had been called the
          microcosm. I have reversed the proposition, and shown the world as
          the macranthropos: because will and idea exhaust its nature as they
          do that of man. But it is clearly more correct to learn to
          understand the world from man than man from the world; for one has
          to explain what is indirectly given, thus external perception from
          what is directly given, thus self-consciousness—not conversely.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With the
          Pantheists, then, I have certainly that ἑν και παν in common, but
          not the παν θεος; because I do not go beyond experience (taken in
          its widest sense), and still less do I put myself in contradiction
          with the data which lie before me. Scotus Erigena, quite
          consistently with the spirit of Pantheism, explains every
          phenomenon as a theophany; but then this conception must also be
          applied to the most terrible and abominable phenomena. Fine
          theophanies! What further distinguishes me from Pantheism is
          principally the following. (1). That their θεος is an <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">x</span></span>, an
          unknown quantity; the will, on the other hand, is of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page472">[pg 472]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg472"></a> all possible things the one that is
          known to us most exactly, the only thing given immediately, and
          therefore exclusively fitted for the explanation of the rest. For
          what is unknown must always be explained by what is better known;
          not conversely. (2). That their θεος manifests himself <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">animi causa</span></span>, to unfold his
          glory, or, indeed, to let himself be admired. Apart from the vanity
          here attributed to him, they are placed in the position of being
          obliged to sophisticate away the colossal evil of the world; but
          the world remains in glaring and terrible contradiction with that
          imagined excellence. With me, on the contrary, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em>
          arrives through its objectification however this may occur, at
          self-knowledge, whereby its abolition, conversion, salvation
          becomes possible. And accordingly, with me alone ethics has a sure
          foundation and is completely worked out in agreement with the
          sublime and profound religions, Brahmanism, Buddhism, and
          Christianity, not merely with Judaism and Mohammedanism. The
          metaphysic of the beautiful also is first fully cleared up as a
          result of my fundamental truth, and no longer requires to take
          refuge behind empty words. With me alone is the evil of the world
          honestly confessed in its whole magnitude: this is rendered
          possible by the fact that the answer to the question as to its
          origin coincides with the answer to the question as to the origin
          of the world. On the other hand, in all other systems, since they
          are all optimistic, the question as to the origin of evil is the
          incurable disease, ever breaking out anew, with which they are
          affected, and in consequence of which they struggle along with
          palliatives and quack remedies. (3.) That I start from experience
          and the natural self-consciousness given to every one, and lead to
          the will as that which alone is metaphysical; thus I adopt the
          ascending, analytical method. The Pantheists, again, adopt the
          opposite method, the descending or synthetical. They start from
          their θεος, which they beg or take by force, although sometimes
          under the name <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">substantia</span></span>, or
          absolute, and this unknown <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page473">[pg 473]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg473"></a> is then supposed to explain everything that
          is better known. (4.) That with me the world does not fill the
          whole possibility of all being, but in this there still remains
          much room for that which we denote only negatively as the denial of
          the will to live. Pantheism, on the other hand, is essentially
          optimism: but if the world is what is best, then the matter may
          rest there. (5.) That to the Pantheists the perceptible world, thus
          the world of idea, is just the intentional manifestation of the God
          indwelling in it, which contains no real explanation of its
          appearance, but rather requires to be explained itself. With me, on
          the other hand, the world as idea appears merely <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">per accidens</span></span>, because the
          intellect, with its external perception, is primarily only the
          medium of motives for the more perfect phenomena of will, which
          gradually rises to that objectivity of perceptibility, in which the
          world exists. In this sense its origin, as an object of perception,
          is really accounted for, and not, as with the Pantheists, by means
          of untenable fictions.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Since, in
          consequence of the Kantian criticism of all speculative theology,
          the philosophisers of Germany almost all threw themselves back upon
          Spinoza, so that the whole series of futile attempts known by the
          name of the post-Kantian philosophy are simply Spinozism
          tastelessly dressed up, veiled in all kinds of unintelligible
          language, and otherwise distorted, I wish, now that I have
          explained the relation of my philosophy to Pantheism in general, to
          point out its relation to Spinozism in particular. It stands, then,
          to Spinozism as the New Testament stands to the Old. What the Old
          Testament has in common with the New is the same God-Creator.
          Analogous to this, the world exists, with me as with Spinoza, by
          its inner power and through itself. But with Spinoza his
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">substantia æterna</span></span>, the inner
          nature of the world, which he himself calls God, is also, as
          regards its moral character and worth, Jehovah, the God-Creator,
          who applauds His own creation, and finds that all is very good,
          παντα καλα <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page474">[pg
          474]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg474"></a>
          λιαν. Spinoza has deprived Him of nothing but personality. Thus,
          according to him also, the world and all in it is wholly excellent
          and as it ought to be: therefore man has nothing more to do than
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">vivere, agere, suum Esse conservare ex
          fundamento proprium utile quærendi</span></span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Eth.</span></span>,
          iv. pr. 67); he is even to rejoice in his life as long as it lasts;
          entirely in accordance with Ecclesiastes ix. 7-10. In short, it is
          optimism: therefore its ethical side is weak, as in the Old
          Testament; nay, it is even false, and in part revolting.<a href="#note_54" id="noteref_54" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">54</span></span></a> With
          me, on the other hand, the will, or the inner nature of the world,
          is by no means Jehovah, it is rather, as it were, the crucified
          Saviour, or the crucified thief, according as it resolves.
          Therefore my ethical teaching agrees with that of Christianity,
          completely and in its highest tendencies, and not less with that of
          Brahmanism and Buddhism. Spinoza could not get rid of the Jews;
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">quo semel est imbuta recens servabit
          odorem</span></span>. His contempt for the brutes, which, as mere
          things for our use, he also declares to be without rights, is
          thoroughly Jewish, and, in union with Pantheism, is at the same
          time absurd and detestable (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Eth.</span></span>, iv., appendix, c. 27).
          With all this Spinoza remains a very great man. But in order to
          estimate his work correctly we must keep in view his relation to
          Descartes. The latter had sharply divided nature into mind and
          matter, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, thinking and extended
          substance, and had also placed God and the world in complete
          opposition to each other; Spinoza also, so long as he was a
          Cartesian, taught all that in his <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cogitatis Metaphysicis</span></span>,”</span>
          c. 12, i. I., 1665. Only in his later years did he see the
          fundamental falseness of that double dualism; and accordingly his
          own philosophy principally consists of the indirect abolition of
          these two antitheses. Yet partly to avoid injuring his teacher,
          partly in order to be less offensive, he <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page475">[pg 475]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg475"></a> gave it a positive appearance by means of a
          strictly dogmatic form, although its content is chiefly negative.
          His identification of the world with God has also this negative
          significance alone. For to call the world God is not to explain it:
          it remains a riddle under the one name as under the other. But
          these two negative truths had value for their age, as for every age
          in which there still are conscious or unconscious Cartesians. He
          makes the mistake, common to all philosophers before Locke, of
          starting from conceptions, without having previously investigated
          their origin, such, for example, as substance, cause, &amp;c., and
          in such a method of procedure these conceptions then receive a much
          too extensive validity. Those who in the most recent times refused
          to acknowledge the Neo-Spinozism which had appeared, for example,
          Jacobi, were principally deterred from doing so by the bugbear of
          fatalism. By this is to be understood every doctrine which refers
          the existence of the world, together with the critical position of
          mankind in it, to any absolute necessity, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          to a necessity that cannot be further explained. Those who feared
          fatalism, again, believed that all that was of importance was to
          deduce the world from the free act of will of a being existing
          outside it; as if it were antecedently certain which of the two was
          more correct, or even better merely in relation to us. What is,
          however, especially assumed here is the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">non datur tertium</span></span>, and
          accordingly hitherto every philosophy has represented one or the
          other. I am the first to depart from this; for I have actually
          established the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Tertium</span></span>: the
          act of will from which the world arises is our own. It is free; for
          the principle of sufficient reason, from which alone all necessity
          derives its significance, is merely the form of its phenomenon.
          Just on this account this phenomenon, if it once exists, is
          absolutely necessary in its course; in consequence of this alone we
          can recognise in it the nature of the act of will, and accordingly
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">eventualiter</span></span> will otherwise.</p>

<span style="font-size: 144%">Chapter I.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Schopenhauer
          points out that Plato and Kant agree in recommending, as the method
          of all knowledge, obedience to two laws:—that of Homogeneity, and
          that of Specification. The former bids us, by attention to the
          points of resemblance and agreement in things, get at their kinds,
          and combine them into species, and these species again into genera,
          until we have arrived at the highest concept of all, that which
          embraces everything. This law being transcendental, or an essential
          in our faculty of reason, assumes that nature is in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page478">[pg 478]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg478"></a> harmony with it, an assumption which is
          expressed in the old rule: <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Entia præter
          necessitatem non esse multiplicanda.</span></span> The law of
          Specification, on the other hand, is stated by Kant in these words:
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Entium varietates non temere esse
          minuendas.</span></span> That is to say, we must carefully
          distinguish the species which are united under a genus, and the
          lower kinds which in their turn are united under these species;
          taking care not to make a leap, and subsume the lower kinds and
          individuals under the concept of the genus, since this is always
          capable of division, but never descends to the object of pure
          perception. Plato and Kant agree that these laws are
          transcendental, and that they presuppose that things are in harmony
          with them.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The previous
          treatment of the principle of sufficient reason, even by Kant, has
          been a failure, owing to the neglect of the second of these laws.
          It may well be that we shall find that this principle is the common
          expression of more than one fundamental principle of knowledge, and
          that the necessity, to which it refers, is therefore of different
          kinds. It may be stated in these words: <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Nihil est sine ratione cur potius sit, quam
          non sit.</span></span> This is the general expression for the
          different forms of the assumption which everywhere justifies that
          question <span class="tei tei-q">“Why?”</span> which is the mother
          of all science.</p>

<span style="font-size: 144%">Chapter II.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Schopenhauer in
          this chapter traces historically the forms in which the principle
          had been stated by his predecessors, and their influence. He points
          out that in Greek philosophy it appeared in two aspects—that of the
          necessity of a ground for a logical judgment, and that of a cause
          for every physical change—and that these two aspects were
          systematically confounded. The Aristotelian division, not of the
          forms of the principle itself, but of one of its aspects, the
          causal, exemplified a confusion which continued throughout the
          Scholastic period. Descartes succeeds no better. His proof of the
          existence of God that the immensity of His nature is a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cause or
          reason</span></em> beyond which no cause is needed for His
          existence, simply illustrates the gross confusion between cause
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page479">[pg 479]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg479"></a> and ground of
          knowledge which underlies every form of this ontological proof.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“That a miserable fellow like Hegel, whose
          entire philosophy is nothing but a monstrous amplification of the
          ontological proof, should dare to defend this proof against Kant's
          criticism of it is an alliance of which the ontological proof
          itself, little as it knows of shame, might well feel ashamed. It is
          not to be expected I should speak respectfully of people who have
          brought philosophy into disrespect.”</span> Spinoza made the same
          confusion when he laid it down that the cause of existence was
          either contained in the nature and definition of the thing as it
          existed, or was to be found outside that thing. It was through this
          confusion of the ground of knowledge with the efficient cause that
          he succeeded in identifying God with the world. The true picture of
          Spinoza's <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Causa sui</span></span>”</span> is Baron
          Munchhausen encircling his horse with his legs, and raising himself
          and the horse upwards by means of his pigtail, with the inscription
          <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Causa
          sui</span></span>”</span> written below. Leibnitz was the first to
          place the principle of sufficient reason in the position of a first
          principle, and to indicate the difference between its two meanings.
          But it was Wolff who first completely distinguished them, and
          divided the doctrine into three kinds: <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium fiendi</span></span> (cause),
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium essendi</span></span>
          (possibility), and <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium
          cognoscendi</span></span>. Baumgarten, Reimarus, Lambert, and
          Platner added nothing to the work of Wolff, and the next great step
          was Hume's question as to the validity of the principle. Kant's
          distinction of the logical or formal principle of knowledge—Every
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">proposition</span></em> must have its ground;
          from the transcendental or material principle, Every <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thing</span></em>
          must have its ground—was followed out by his immediate successors.
          But when we come to Schelling we find the proposition that
          gravitation is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">reason</span></em> and light the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cause</span></em>
          of things, a proposition which is quoted simply as a curiosity, for
          such a piece of nonsense deserves no place among the opinions of
          earnest and honest inquirers. The chapter concludes by pointing out
          the futility of the attempts to prove the principle. Every proof is
          the exhibition of the ground of a judgment which has been
          expressed, and of which, just because that ground is exhibited, we
          predicate truth. The principle of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page480">[pg 480]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg480"></a> sufficient reason is just this expression of
          the demand for such a ground, and he who seeks a proof,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the exhibition of a ground
          for this principle itself, presupposes it as true, and so falls
          into the circle of seeking a proof of the justification of the
          demand for proof.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the third
          chapter Schopenhauer points out that the two applications of the
          principle of sufficient reason distinguished by his predecessors,
          to judgments, which must have a ground, and to the changes of real
          objects, which must have a cause, are not exhaustive. The reason
          why the three sides of a certain triangle are equal is that the
          angles are equal, and this is neither a logical deduction nor a
          case of causation. With a view to stating exhaustively the various
          kinds into which the application of the principle falls it is
          necessary to determine the nature of the principle itself. All our
          ideas are objects of the subject, and all objects of the subject
          are our ideas. But our ideas stand to one another as a matter of
          fact in an orderly connection, which is always determinable
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span> in point of form, and
          on account of which nothing that is in itself separate and wholly
          independent of other things can be the object of our consciousness.
          It is this connection which the principle of sufficient reason in
          its generality expresses. The relations which constitute it are
          what Schopenhauer calls its root, and they fall into four classes,
          which are discussed in the four following chapters.</p>

<span style="font-size: 144%">Chapter IV.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the fourth
          chapter Schopenhauer deals with the first class of objects for the
          subject and the form of the principle of sufficient reason which
          obtains in it. This first class is that of those complete ideas of
          perception which form part of our experience, and which are
          referable to some sensation of our bodies. These ideas are capable
          of being perceived only under the forms of Space and Time. If time
          were the only form there would be no coexistence, and therefore no
          persistence. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page481">[pg
          481]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg481"></a>
          If space were their only form there would be no succession, and
          therefore no change. Time may therefore be defined as the
          possibility of mutually exclusive conditions of the same thing. But
          the union of these two forms of existence is the essential
          condition of reality, and this union is the work of the
          understanding (see <span class="tei tei-q">“World as Will and
          Idea,”</span> vol. i. § 4, and the table of predicables annexed to
          vol. ii., chap. 4). In this class of objects for the subject the
          principle of sufficient reason appears as the law of causality or
          the principle of sufficient reason of becoming, and it is through
          it that all objects which present themselves in perception are
          bound together through the changes of their states. When a new
          state of one or more objects makes its appearance it must have been
          preceded by another on which it regularly follows. This is causal
          sequence, and the first state is the cause, the second the effect.
          The law has thus to do exclusively with the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">changes</span></em>
          of objects of external experience, and not with things themselves,
          a circumstance which is fatal to the validity of the cosmological
          proof of the existence of God. It follows also from the essential
          connection of causality with succession that the notion of
          reciprocity, with its contemporaneous existence of cause and
          effect, is a delusion. The chain of causes and effects does not
          affect either matter, which is that in which all changes take
          place, or the original forces of nature, through which causation
          becomes possible, and which exist apart from all change, and in
          this sense out of time, but which yet are everywhere present
          (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span>, chemical forces, see
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">supra</span></span>, vol. i., § 26). In nature
          causation assumes three different forms; that of cause in the
          narrow sense, of stimulus, and of motive, on which differences
          depend the true distinctions between inorganic bodies, plants, and
          animals. It is only of cause properly so called that Newton's third
          law of the equality of action and reaction is true, and only here
          do we find the degree of the effect proportionate to that of the
          cause. The absence of this feature characterises stimulation.
          Motive demands knowledge as its condition, and intelligence is
          therefore the true characteristic of the animal. The three forms
          are in principle identical, the difference being due to the degrees
          of receptivity in existence. What is called freedom <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page482">[pg 482]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg482"></a> of the will is therefore an absurdity,
          as is also Kant's <span class="tei tei-q">“Practical
          Reason.”</span> These results are followed by an examination of the
          nature of vision, which Schopenhauer sums up in these words:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I have examined all these visual processes
          in detail in order to show that the understanding is active in all
          of them, the understanding which, by apprehending every change as
          an effect and referring it to its cause, creates on the basis of
          the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span> and
          fundamental intuitions or perceptions of space and time, the
          objective world, that phenomenon of the brain, for which the
          sensations of the senses afford only certain data. And this task
          the understanding accomplishes only through its proper form, the
          law of causality, and accomplishes it directly without the aid of
          reflection, that is, of abstract knowledge through concepts and
          words, which are the material of secondary knowledge, of thought,
          thus of the Reason.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“What
          understanding knows aright is reality; what reason knows aright is
          truth, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, a judgment which has a
          ground; the opposite of the former being illusion (what is falsely
          perceived), of the latter error (what is falsely thought).”</span>
          All understanding is an immediate apprehension of the causal
          relation, and this is the sole function of understanding, and not
          the complicated working of the twelve Kantian Categories, the
          theory of which is a mistaken one. A consequence of this conclusion
          is, that arithmetical processes do not belong to the understanding,
          concerned as they are with abstract conceptions. But it must not be
          forgotten that between volition and the apparently consequential
          action of the body there is no causal relation, for they are the
          same thing perceived in two different ways. Section 23 contains a
          detailed refutation of Kant's proof of the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          priori</span></span> nature of the causal relation in the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Second Analogy of Experience”</span> of
          the Critique of Pure Reason, the gist of the objection being that
          the so-called subjective succession is as much objective in reality
          as what is called objective by Kant: <span class="tei tei-q">“Phenomena may well follow one another, without
          following <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">from</span></em> one another.”</span></p>

<span style="font-size: 144%">Chapter V.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The fifth
          chapter commences with an examination of the distinction between
          man and the brutes. Man possesses <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">reason</span></em>,
          that is to say, he has a class of ideas of which the brutes are not
          capable, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">abstract</span></em> ideas as distinguished
          from those ideas of perception from which the former kind are yet
          derived. The consequence is, that the brute neither speaks nor
          laughs, and lacks all those qualities which make human life great.
          The nature of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">motives</span></em>, too, is different where
          abstract ideas are possible. No doubt the actions of men follow of
          necessity from their causes, not less than is the case with the
          brutes, but the kind of sequence through thought which renders
          choice, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the conscious conflict of
          motives, possible is different. Our abstract ideas, being incapable
          of being objects of perception, would be outside consciousness, and
          the operations of thought would be impossible, were it not that
          they are fixed for sense by arbitrary signs called words, which
          therefore always indicate <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">general</span></em> conceptions. It is just
          because the brutes are incapable of general conceptions that they
          have no faculty of speech. But thought does not consist in the mere
          presence of abstract ideas in consciousness, but in the union and
          separation of two or more of them, subject to the manifold
          restrictions and modifications which logic deals with. Such a
          clearly expressed conceptual relation is a judgment. In relation to
          judgments the principle of sufficient reason is valid in a new
          form: that of the ground of knowing. In this form it asserts that
          if a judgment is to express knowledge it must have a ground; and it
          is just because it has a ground that it has ascribed to it the
          predicate true. The grounds on which a judgment may depend are
          divisible into four kinds. A judgment may have another judgment as
          its ground, in which case its truth is formal or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">logical</span></em>. There is no truth except
          in the relation of a judgment to something outside it, and
          intrinsic truth, which is sometimes distinguished from extrinsic
          logical truth, is therefore an absurdity. A judgment may also have
          its ground in sense-perception, and its truth is then material
          truth. Again, those forms of knowledge which <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page484">[pg 484]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg484"></a> lie in the understanding and in pure
          sensibility, as the conditions of the possibility of experience,
          may be the ground of a judgment which is then synthetical
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span>. Finally, those formal
          conditions of all thinking which lie in the reason may be the
          ground of a judgment, which may in that case be called
          metalogically true. Of these metalogical judgments there are four,
          and they were long ago discovered and called laws of thought. (1.)
          A subject is equal to the sum of its predicates. (2.) A subject
          cannot at once have a given predicate affirmed and denied of it.
          (3.) Of two contradictorily opposed predicates one must belong to
          every subject. (4.) Truth is the relation of a judgment to
          something outside it as its sufficient reason. Reason, it may be
          remarked, has no material but only formal truth.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The third class
          of objects for the subject is constituted by the formal element in
          perception, the forms of outer and inner sense, space and time.
          This class of ideas, in which time and space appear as pure
          intuitions, is distinguished from that other class in which they
          are objects of perception by the presence of matter which has been
          shown to be the perceptibility of time and space in one aspect, and
          causality which has become objective, in another. Space and time
          have this property, that all their parts stand to one another in a
          relation in which each is determined and conditioned by another.
          This relation is peculiar, and is intelligible to us neither
          through understanding nor through reason, but solely through pure
          intuition or perception <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          priori</span></span>. And the law according to which the parts of
          space and time thus determine one another is called the law of
          sufficient reason of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">being</span></em>. In space every position is
          determined with reference to every other position, so that the
          first stands to the second in the relation of a consequence to its
          ground. In time every moment is conditioned by that which precedes
          it. The ground of being, in the form of the law of sequence, is
          here very simple owing to the circumstance that time has only one
          dimension. On the nexus <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page485">[pg
          485]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg485"></a>
          of the position of the parts of space depends the entire science of

          from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">insight</span></em> into the ground of being.
          Thus it is that the attempt, which even Euclid at times makes, to
          produce <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">conviction</span></em>, as distinguished from
          insight into the ground of being, in geometry, is a mistake, and

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The remaining
          class of objects for the subject is a very peculiar and important
          one. It comprehends only one object, the immediate object of inner
          sense, the subject in volition which becomes an object of
          knowledge, but only in inner sense, and therefore always in time
          and never in space; and in time only under limitations. There can
          be no knowledge of knowledge, for that would imply that the subject
          had separated itself from knowledge, and yet knew knowledge, which
          is impossible. The subject is the condition of the existence of
          ideas, and can never itself become idea or object. It knows itself
          therefore never as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">knowing</span></em>, but only as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">willing</span></em>. Thus what we know in
          ourselves is never what knows, but what wills, the will. The
          identity of the subject of volition with the subject of knowledge,
          through which the word <span class="tei tei-q">“I”</span> includes
          both, is the insoluble problem. The identity of the knowing with
          the known is inexplicable, and yet is immediately present. The
          operation of a motive is not, like that of all other causes, known
          only from without, and therefore indirectly, but also from within.
          Motivation is, in fact, causality viewed from within.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this, the
          concluding chapter, Schopenhauer sums up his results. Necessity has
          no meaning other than that of the irresistible sequence of the
          effect where the cause is given. All necessity is thus conditioned,
          and absolute or unconditioned necessity is a contradiction in
          terms. And there is a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page486">[pg
          486]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg486"></a>
          fourfold necessity corresponding to the four forms of the principle
          of sufficient reason:—(1.) The logical form, according to the
          principle of the ground of knowledge; on account of which, if the
          premisses are given, the conclusion follows. (2.) The physical
          form, according to the law of causality; on account of which, if
          the cause is given, the effect must follow. (3.) The mathematical
          form, according to the law of being; on account of which every
          relation expressed by a true geometrical proposition is what it is
          affirmed to be, and every correct calculation is irrefutable. (4.)
          The moral form, on account of which every human being and every
          brute must, when the motive appears, perform the only act which
          accords with the inborn and unalterable character. A consequence of
          this is, that every department of science has one or other of the
          forms of the principle of sufficient reason as its basis. In
          conclusion, Schopenhauer points out that just because the principle
          of sufficient reason belongs to the <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          priori</span></span> element in intelligence, it cannot be applied

          intelligence. Such a universe is mere phenomenon, and what is only
          true because it belongs to the form of intelligence can have no
          application to intelligence itself. Thus it is that it cannot be
          said that the universe and all things in it exist because of
          something else. In other words, the cosmological proof of the
          existence of God is inadmissible.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Preface to the
        Third Edition.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What is true and
        genuine would more easily gain room in the world if it were not that
        those who are incapable of producing it are also sworn to prevent it
        from succeeding. This fact has already hindered and retarded, when
        indeed it has not choked, many a work that should have been of
        benefit to the world. For me the consequence of this has been, that
        although I was only thirty years old when the first edition of this
        work appeared, I live to see this third edition not earlier than my
        seventy-second year. Yet for this I find comfort in the words of
        Petrarch: <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Si quis tota die currens,
        pervenit ad vesperam satis est</span></span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">de vera
        Sapientia</span></span>, p. 140). If I also have at last arrived, and
        have the satisfaction at the end of my course of seeing the beginning
        of my influence, it is with the hope that, according to an old rule
        it will endure long in proportion to the lateness of its
        beginning.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this third
        edition the reader will miss nothing that was contained in the
        second, but will receive considerably more, for, on account of the
        additions that have been made in it, it has, with the same type, 136
        pages more than the second.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Seven years after
        the appearance of the second edition I published two volumes of
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Parerga and Paralipomena.”</span> What is
        included under the latter name consists of additions to the
        systematic exposition of my philosophy, and would have found its
        right place in these volumes, but I was obliged to find a place for
        it then where I could, as it was very doubtful whether I would live
        to see this third edition. It will be found in the second volume of
        the said <span class="tei tei-q">“Parerga,”</span> and will be easily
        recognised from the headings of the chapters.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Siècle</span></span>, 10th April 1859, there
            appears, very beautifully written, the story of a squirrel that
            was magically drawn by a serpent into its very jaws: <span class="tei tei-q">“Un voyageur qui vient de parcourir plusieurs
            provinces de l'ile de Java cite un exemple remarqueable du
            pouvoir facinateur des serpens. Le voyageur dont il est question
            commençait à gravir Junjind, un des monts appelés par les
            Hollandais Pepergebergte. Après avoir pénétré dans une épaisse
            forêt, il aperçut sur les branches d'un kijatile un écureuil de
            Java à tête blanche, folâtrant avec la grâce et l'agilité qui
            distinguent cette charmante espèce de rongeurs. Un nid sphérique,
            formé de brins flexible et de mousse, placé dans les parties les
            plus élevées de l'arbre, a l'enfourchure de deux branches, et une
            cavité dans le tronc, semblaient les points de mire de ses jeux.
            A peine s'en était-il éloigné qu'il y revenait avec une ardeur
            extrême. On était dans le mois de Juillet, et probablement
            l'écureuil avait en haut ses petits, et dans le bas le magasin à
            fruits. Bientôt il fut comme saisi d'effroi, ces mouvemens
            devinrent désordonnés, on eut dit qu'il cherchait toujours à
            mettre un obstacle entre lui et certaines parties de l'arbre:
            puis il se tapit et resta immobile entre deux branches. Le
            voyageur eut le sentiment d'un danger pour l'innocente bête, mais
            il ne pouvait deviner lequel. Il approcha, et un examen attentif
            lui fit découvrir dans un creux du tronc une couleuvre lieu,
            dardant ses yeux fixes dans la direction de l'écureuil. Notre
            voyageur trembla pour le pauvre écureuil. La couleuvre était si
            attentive à sa proie qu'elle ne semblait nullement remarquer la
            présence d'un homme. Notre voyageur, qui était armé, aurait donc
            prevenir en aide à l'infortuné rongeur en tuant le serpent. Mais
            la science l'emporta sur la pitié, et il voulut voir quelle issue
            aurait le drame. Le dénoûment fut tragique. L'écureuil ne tarda
            point à pousser un cri plaintif qui, pour tous ceux qui le
            connaissent, dénote le voisinage d'un serpent. Il avança un peu,
            essaya de reculer, revint encore en avant, tâche de retourner en
            arrière. Mais s'approcha toujours plus du reptile. La couleuvre,
            roulée en spirale, la tête au dessus des anneaux, et immobile
            comme un morceau de bois, ne le quittait pas du regard.
            L'écureuil, de branche en branche, et descendant toujours plus
            bas, arriva jusqu'à la partie nue du tronc. Alors le pauvre
            animal ne tenta même plus de fuir le danger. Attiré par une
            puissance invincible, et comme poussé par le vertige, il se
            précipita dans la gueule du serpent, qui s'ouvrit tout à coup
            démesurément pour le recevoir. Autant la couleuvre avait été
            inerte jusque là autant elle devint active dès qu'elle fut en
            possession de sa proie. Déroulant ses anneaux et prenant sa
            course de bas en haut avec une agilité inconcevable, sa reptation
            la porta en un clin d'œil au sommet de l'arbre, où elle alla sans
            doute digérer et dormir.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this
            example we see what spirit animates nature, for it reveals itself
            in it, and how very true is the saying of Aristotle quoted above
            (p. 106). This story is not only important with regard to
            fascination, but also as an argument for pessimism. That an
            animal is surprised and attacked by another is bad; still we can
            console ourselves for that; but that such a poor innocent
            squirrel sitting beside its nest with its young is compelled,
            step by step, reluctantly, battling with itself and lamenting, to
            approach the wide, open jaws of the serpent and consciously throw
            itself into them is revolting and atrocious. What monstrous kind
            of nature is this to which we belong!</p>

          Nirvana is derived from <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">vana</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“sinful desires,”</span> with the negative <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">nir</span></span>. J. J. Schmidt, in his
          translation of the history of the Eastern Mongolians, says that the
          Sanscrit word Nirvana is translated into Mongolian by a phrase
          which signifies <span class="tei tei-q">“departed from
          misery,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“escaped from
          misery.”</span> According to the learned lectures of the same in
          the St. Petersburg Academy, Nirvana is the opposite of Sanfara,
          which is the world of constant re-birth, of longings and desires,
          of illusion of the senses and changing forms, of being born,
          growing old, becoming sick, and dying. In the Burmese language the
          word Nirvana, according to the analogy of other Sanscrit words,
          becomes transformed into Nieban, and is translated by <span class="tei tei-q">“complete vanishing.”</span> See Sangermano's
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Description of the Burmese Empire,”</span>
          translated by Tandy, Rome, 1833, § 27. In the first edition of 1819
          I also wrote Nieban, because we then knew Buddhism only from meagre
          accounts of the Burmese.</dd>

          proposal is not bad: the punishment is very severe; it makes
          persons contemptible, and yet leaves them still fit for trades; and
          if stealing is hereditary, in this way it is not propagated.
          Moreover, the courage ceases, and since the sexual passion so
          frequently leads to thefts, this cause would also disappear. The
          remark that women would so much the more eagerly restrain their
          husbands from stealing is roguish, for as things are at present

            view the essential immanence of our knowledge and of all
            knowledge, which arises from the fact that it is a secondary
            thing which has only appeared for the ends of the will, it then
            becomes explicable to us that all mystics of all religions
            ultimately attain to a kind of ecstasy, in which all and every
            knowledge, with its whole fundamental form, object and subject,
            entirely ceases, and only in this sphere, which lies beyond all
            knowledge, do they claim to have reached their highest goal, for
            they have then attained to the sphere in which there is no longer
            any subject and object, and consequently no more knowledge, just
            because there is no more will, the service of which is the sole
            destiny of knowledge.</p>

            and perception, and that in many passages of the Upanischads
            instructions are given to sink oneself, silently and inwardly
            pronouncing the mysterious Oum, in the depths of one's own being,

Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
