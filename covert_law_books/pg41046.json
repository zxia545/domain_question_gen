Almost from the beginning of the science of the\nLaw of Nations the question has been discussed whether\nthe rules of International Law are legally binding.\nHobbes [3] already and Pufendorf [4] had answered the\nquestion in the negative. And during the nineteenth [Pg 5] century Austin [5] and his followers take up the same\nattitude. They define law as a body of rules for human\nconduct set and enforced by a sovereign political authority.\nIf indeed this definition of law be correct, the\nLaw of Nations cannot be called law. For International\nLaw is a body of rules governing the relations\nof Sovereign States between one another. And there\nis not and cannot be a sovereign political authority\nabove the Sovereign States which could enforce such\nrules. However, this definition of law is not correct.\nIt covers only the written or statute law within a State,\nthat part of the Municipal Law which is expressly made\nby statutes of Parliament in a constitutional State or\nby some other sovereign authority in a non-constitutional\nState. It does not cover that part of Municipal\nLaw which is termed unwritten or customary law.\nThere is, in fact, no community and no State in the\nworld which could exist with written law only. Everywhere\nthere is customary law in existence besides the\nwritten law. This customary law was never expressly\nenacted by any law-giving body, or it would not be\nmerely customary law. Those who define law as rules\nset and enforced by a sovereign political authority do\nnot deny the existence of customary law. But they\nmaintain that the customary law has the character of\nlaw only through the indirect recognition on the part\nof the State which is to be found in the fact that courts\nof justice apply the customary in the same way as the\nwritten law, and that the State does not prevent them\nfrom doing so. This is, however, nothing else than a\nfiction. Courts of justice having no law-giving power\ncould not recognise unwritten rules as law if these\nrules were not law before that recognition, and States\nrecognise unwritten rules as law only because courts of\njustice do so.",

For the purpose of finding a correct definition\nof law it is indispensable to compare morality and law\nwith each other, for both lay down rules, and to a great\nextent the same rules, for human conduct. Now the\ncharacteristic of rules of morality is that they apply to\nconscience, and to conscience only. An act loses all\nvalue before the tribunal of morality, if it was not done\nout of free will and conscientiousness, but was enforced\nby some external power or was done out of some consideration\nwhich lies without the boundaries of conscience.\nThus, a man who gives money to the hospitals\nin order that his name shall come before the public\ndoes not act morally, and his deed is not a moral\none, though it appears to be one outwardly. On the\nother hand, the characteristic of rules of law is that\nthey shall eventually be enforced by external power.

But the latter require to\nbe enforced by the internal power of conscience only,\nwhereas the former require to be enforced by some\nexternal power.

On the\nother hand, if the law gives the same command, it\nhopes that, if the conscience has not sufficient power to\nmake you pay your debts, the fact that, if you will not\npay, the bailiff will come into your house, will do so.",

If these are the characteristic signs of morality\nand of law, we are justified in stating the principle:\nA rule is a rule of morality, if by common consent of\nthe community it applies to conscience and to conscience\nonly; whereas, on the other hand, a rule is a\nrule of law, if by common consent of the community it\nshall eventually be enforced by external power. Without [Pg 7] some kind both of morality and law, no community\nhas ever existed or could possibly exist. But there\nneed not be, at least not among primitive communities,\na law-giving authority within a community. Just as\nthe rules of morality are growing through the influence\nof many different factors, so the law can grow without\nbeing expressly laid down and set by a law-giving\nauthority. Wherever we have an opportunity of\nobserving a primitive community, we find that some\nof its rules for human conduct apply to conscience\nonly, whereas others shall by common consent of the\ncommunity be enforced; the former are rules of morality\nonly, whereas the latter are rules of law. For the\nexistence of law neither a law-giving authority nor\ncourts of justice are essential. Whenever a question of\nlaw arises in a primitive community, it is the community\nitself and not a court which decides it. Of\ncourse, when a community is growing out of the primitive\ncondition of its existence and becomes gradually\nso enlarged that it turns into a State in the sense\nproper of the term, the necessities of life and altered\ncircumstances of existence do not allow the community\nitself any longer to do anything and everything. And\nthe law can now no longer be left entirely in the hands\nof the different factors which make it grow gradually\nfrom case to case. A law-giving authority is now just\nas much wanted as a governing authority. It is for\nthis reason that we find in every State a Legislature,\nwhich makes laws, and courts of justice, which administer\nthem.",

Thus, in Great Britain, Parliament is\nthe law-making body by common consent. An Act\nof Parliament is law, because the common consent of [Pg 8] Great Britain is behind it. That Parliament has law-making\nauthority is law itself, but unwritten and\ncustomary law. Thus the very important fact comes to\nlight that all statute or written law is based on unwritten\nlaw in so far as the power of Parliament to make Statute\nLaw is given to Parliament by unwritten law. It is the\ncommon consent of the British people that Parliament\nshall have the power of making rules which shall be\nenforced by external power. But besides the statute\nlaws made by Parliament there exist and are constantly\ngrowing other laws, unwritten or customary, which are\nday by day recognised through courts of justice."

As the first condition is the existence of a community,\nthe question arises, whether an international\ncommunity exists whose law could be the Law of\nNations. Before this question can be answered, the [Pg 10] conception of community must be defined. A community\nmay be said to be the body of a number of\nindividuals more or less bound together through such\ncommon interests as create a constant and manifold\nintercourse between the single individuals. This definition\nof community covers not only a community of\nindividual men, but also a community of individual\ncommunities such as individual States. A Confederation\nof States is a community of States. But is there\na universal international community of all individual\nStates in existence? This question is decidedly to be\nanswered in the affirmative as far as the States of the\ncivilised world are concerned. Innumerable are the\ninterests which knit all the individual civilised States\ntogether and which create constant intercourse between\nthese States as well as between their subjects. As the\ncivilised States are, with only a few exceptions, Christian\nStates, there are already religious ideas which wind a\nband around them. There are, further, science and\nart, which are by their nature to a great extent international,\nand which create a constant exchange of ideas\nand opinions between the subjects of the several\nStates. Of the greatest importance are, however,\nagriculture, industry, and trade. It is totally impossible\neven for the largest empire to produce everything its\nsubjects want. Therefore, the productions of agriculture\nand industry must be exchanged by the several\nStates, and it is for this reason that international\ntrade is an unequalled factor for the welfare of\nevery civilised State. Even in antiquity, when every\nState tried to be a world in itself, States did not\nand could not exist without some sort of international\ntrade. It is international trade which has created\nnavigation on the high seas and on the rivers flowing\nthrough different States. It is, again, international\ntrade which has called into existence the nets of [Pg 11] railways which cover the continents, the international\npostal and telegraphic arrangements, and the Transatlantic\ntelegraphic cables.

And in the necessary absence of\na central authority for the enforcement of the rules of\nthe Law of Nations, the States have to take the law\ninto their own hands. Self-help and intervention on\nthe part of other States which sympathise with the\nwronged one are the means by which the rules of the\nLaw of Nations can be [10] and actually are enforced. It\nis true that these means have many disadvantages,\nbut they are means which have the character of external\npower. Compared with Municipal Law and the means\nat disposal for its enforcement, the Law of Nations is\ncertainly the weaker of the two. A law is the stronger,\nthe more guarantees are given that it can and will be\nenforced. Thus, the law of a State which is governed\nby an uncorrupt Government and the courts of which\nare not venal is stronger than the law of a State which\nhas a corrupt Government and venal judges. It is\ninevitable that the Law of Nations must be a weaker [Pg 14] law than Municipal Law, as there is not and cannot be\nan international Government above the national ones\nwhich could enforce the rules of International Law in\nthe same way as a national Government enforces the\nrules of its Municipal Law. But a weak law is nevertheless\nstill law, and the Law of Nations is by no means\nso weak a law as it sometimes seems to be. [11]",

Likewise,\npublic opinion of all civilised States considers every\nState legally bound to comply with the rules of the Law\nof Nations, not taking notice of the opinion of those\ntheorists who maintain that the Law of Nations does\nnot bear the character of real law. And the several\nStates not only recognise the rules of International\nLaw as legally binding in innumerable treaties, but\nemphasise every day the fact that there is a law between\nthemselves. They moreover recognise this law\nby their Municipal Laws ordering their officials, their\ncivil and criminal courts, and their subjects to take up\nsuch an attitude as is in conformity with the duties\nimposed upon their Sovereign by the Law of Nations.\nIf a violation of the Law of Nations occurs on the part\nof an individual State, public opinion of the civilised\nworld, as well as the Governments of other States,\nstigmatise such violation as a violation of law pure and [Pg 15] simple. And countless treaties concerning trade, navigation,\npost, telegraph, copyright, extradition, and\nmany other objects exist between civilised States,\nwhich treaties, resting entirely on the existence of a law\nbetween the States, presuppose such a law, and contribute\nby their very existence to its development and\ngrowth.",

The\nfact is that States, in breaking the Law of Nations,\nnever deny its existence, but recognise its existence\nthrough the endeavour to interpret the Law of Nations\nin a way favourable to their act. And there is an\never-growing tendency to bring disputed questions of\nInternational Law as well as international differences\nin general before international courts. The permanent\nCourt of Arbitration at the Hague established in 1899,\nand the International Prize Court proposed at the\nHague according to a convention of 1907, are the first\npromising fruits of this tendency."

What, now, does the term \"common consent\"\nmean?

As far as the process of\nthe growth of a usage and its turning into a custom\ncan be traced back, customary rules of the Law of\nNations came into existence in the following way. The\nintercourse of States with each other necessitated some\nrules of international conduct. Single usages, therefore,\ngradually grew up, the different States acting in\nthe same or in a similar way when an occasion arose.\nAs some rules of international conduct were from the\nend of the Middle Ages urgently wanted, the theory of\nthe Law of Nations prepared the ground for their\ngrowth by constructing certain rules on the basis of\nreligious, moral, rational, and historical reflections.\nHugo Grotius's work, \"De Jure Belli ac Pacis libri III.\"\n(1625), offered a systematised body of rules, which\nrecommended themselves so much to the needs and\nwants of the time that they became the basis of the\ndevelopment following. Without the conviction of the\nGovernments and of public opinion of the civilised\nStates that there ought to be legally binding rules for\ninternational conduct, on the one hand, and, on the\nother hand, without the pressure exercised upon the\nStates by their interests and the necessity for the\ngrowth of such rules, the latter would never have [Pg 18] grown up. When afterwards, especially in the nineteenth\ncentury, it became apparent that customs and\nusages alone were not sufficient or not sufficiently clear,\nnew rules were created through law-making treaties\nbeing concluded which laid down rules for future international\nconduct.

It is therefore not necessary to prove\nfor every single rule of International Law that every\nsingle member of the Family of Nations consented to\nit. No single State can say on its admittance into the\nFamily of Nations that it desires to be subjected to\nsuch and such a rule of International Law, and not to\nothers. The admittance includes the duty to submit\nto all the rules in force, with the sole exception of those\nwhich, such as the rules of the Geneva Convention\nfor instance, are specially stipulated for such States\nonly as have concluded, or later on acceded to,\na certain international treaty creating the rules\nconcerned.",

The\nbody of the rules of this law can be altered by common\nconsent only, not by a unilateral declaration on the\npart of one State. This applies not only to customary\nrules, but also to such conventional rules as have been\ncalled into existence through a law-making treaty for\nthe purpose of creating a permanent mode of future\ninternational conduct without a right of the signatory\npowers to give notice of withdrawal. It would, for [Pg 19] instance, be a violation of International Law on the\npart of a signatory Power of the Declaration of Paris\nof 1856 to declare that it would cease to be a party.\nBut it must be emphasised that this does not apply to\nsuch conventional rules as are stipulated by a law-making\ntreaty which expressly reserves the right to the\nsignatory Powers to give notice."

The fact is that the term \"source\nof law\" is made use of in different meanings by the [Pg 21] different writers on International Law, as on law in\ngeneral. It seems to me that most writers confound\nthe conception of \"source\" with that of \"cause,\" and\nthrough this mistake come to a standpoint from which\ncertain factors which influence the growth of International\nLaw appear as sources of rules of the Law of\nNations. This mistake can be avoided by going back\nto the meaning of the term \"source\" in general.\nSource means a spring or well, and has to be defined\nas the rising from the ground of a stream of water.\nWhen we see a stream of water and want to know\nwhence it comes, we follow the stream upwards until\nwe come to the spot where it rises naturally from the\nground. On that spot, we say, is the source of the\nstream of water. We know very well that this source\nis not the cause of the existence of the stream of water.\nSource signifies only the natural rising of water from a\ncertain spot of the ground, whatever natural causes\nthere may be for that rising. If we apply the conception\nof source in this meaning to the term \"source of\nlaw,\" the confusion of source with cause cannot arise.\nJust as we see streams of water running over the\nsurface of the earth, so we see, as it were, streams of\nrules running over the area of law. And if we want to\nknow whence these rules come, we have to follow these\nstreams upwards until we come to their beginning.\nWhere we find that such rules rise into existence, there\nis the source of them. Of course, rules of law do not\nrise from a spot on the ground as water does; they\nrise from facts in the historical development of a community.\nThus in Great Britain a good many rules\nof law rise every year from Acts of Parliament.\n\"Source of Law\" is therefore the name for an historical\nfact out of which rules of conduct rise into existence\nand legal force."

On the other hand,\nthere have been many law-making treaties concluded\nwhich contain general International Law, because the\nmajority of States, including leading Powers, are parties\nto them. General International Law has a tendency\nto become universal because such States as hitherto did [Pg 24] not consent to it will in future either expressly give\ntheir consent or recognise the respective rules tacitly\nthrough custom. [15] But it must be emphasised that,\nwhereas custom is the original source of International\nLaw, treaties are a source the power of which derives\nfrom custom. For the fact that treaties can stipulate\nrules of international conduct at all is based on the\ncustomary rule of the Law of Nations, that treaties are\nbinding upon the contracting parties. [16]",

Neither of these opinions would\nseem to be in conformity with the facts of the present\ninternational life and the basis of the Law of Nations.\nThere is no doubt that the Law of Nations is a product\nof Christian civilisation. It originally arose between\nthe States of Christendom only, and for hundreds of\nyears was confined to these States. Between Christian\nand Mohammedan nations a condition of perpetual\nenmity prevailed in former centuries.

Whenever afterwards a\nnew Christian State made its appearance in Europe, it\nwas received into the charmed circle by the old members\nof the Family of Nations.

                                        "(2) The next group of States which entered into\nthe Family of Nations is the body of Christian States\nwhich grew up outside Europe. All the American [29] States which arose out of colonies of European States\nbelong to this group. And it must be emphasised that\nthe United States of America have largely contributed\nto the growth of the rules of International Law. The\ntwo Christian Negro Republics of Liberia in West\nAfrica and of Haiti on the island of San Domingo\nbelong to this group.",

This reception\nhas expressly taken place through Article 7 of the\nPeace Treaty of Paris of 1856, in which the five Great [Pg 33] European Powers of the time, namely, France, Austria,\nEngland, Prussia, and Russia, and besides those\nSardinia, the nucleus of the future Great Power Italy,\nexpressly \"déclarent la Sublime Porte admise à participer\naux avantages du droit public et du concert\neuropéens.\" Since that time Turkey has on the whole\nendeavoured in time of peace and war to act in conformity\nwith the rules of International Law, and she\nhas, on the other hand, been treated [30] accordingly by\nthe Christian States. No general congress has taken\nplace since 1856 to which Turkey has not been invited\nto send her delegates.",

It is for this reason that the so-called Capitulations are still\nin force and that other anomalies still prevail, but their disappearance\nis only a question of time.]",

A generation ago one might have\ndoubted whether Japan was a real and full member\nof that family, but since the end of the nineteenth\ncentury no doubt is any longer justified. Through\nmarvellous efforts, Japan has become not only a modern\nState, but an influential Power.

However, their civilisation\nhas not yet reached that condition which is necessary\nto enable their Governments and their population in\nevery respect to understand and to carry out the command\nof the rules of International Law. On the other\nhand, international intercourse has widely arisen between\nthese States and the States of the so-called [Pg 34] Western civilisation. Many treaties have been concluded\nwith them, and there is full diplomatic intercourse\nbetween them and the Western States. China,\nPersia, and Siam have even taken part in the Hague\nPeace Conferences. All of them make efforts to educate\ntheir populations, to introduce modern institutions,\nand thereby to raise their civilisation to the level of\nthat of the Western. They will certainly succeed in this\nrespect in the near future. But as yet they have not\naccomplished this task, and consequently they are not\nyet able to be received into the Family of Nations as\nfull members. Although they are, as will be shown\n below (§ 103 ), for some parts within the circle of the\nFamily of Nations, they remain for other parts outside.\nBut the example of Japan can show them that it depends\nentirely upon their own efforts to be received\nas full members into that family.",

It cannot be maintained\nthat codification is everywhere, at all times,\nand under all circumstances opportune. Codification\ncertainly interferes with the so-called organic growth of\nthe law through usage into custom. It is true that\na law, once codified, cannot so easily adapt itself to\nthe individual merits of particular cases which come\nunder it. It is further a fact, which cannot be denied,\nthat together with codification there frequently enters\ninto courts of justice and into the area of juridical\nliterature a hair-splitting tendency and an interpretation\nof the law which often clings more to the letter\nand the word of the law than to its spirit and its principles.\nAnd it is not at all a fact that codification\ndoes away with controversies altogether. Codification [Pg 41] certainly clears up many questions of law which have\nbeen hitherto debatable, but it creates at the same\ntime new controversies. And, lastly, all jurists know\nvery well that the art of legislation is still in its infancy\nand not at all highly developed. The hands of legislators\nare very often clumsy, and legislation often does\nmore harm than good. Yet, on the other hand, the\nfact must be recognised that history has given its\nverdict in favour of codification. There is no civilised\nState in existence whose Municipal Law is not to a\ngreater or lesser extent codified. The growth of the\nlaw through custom goes on very slowly and gradually,\nvery often too slowly to be able to meet the demands\nof the interests at stake. New interests and new inventions\nvery often spring up with which customary\nlaw cannot deal. Circumstances and conditions frequently\nchange so suddenly that the ends of justice\nare not met by the existing customary law of a State.\nThus, legislation, which is, of course, always partial\ncodification, becomes often a necessity in the face of\nwhich all hesitation and scruple must vanish. Whatever\nmay be the disadvantages of codification, there\ncomes a time in the development of every civilised\nState when it can no longer be avoided. And great\nare the advantages of codification, especially of a codification\nthat embraces a large part of the law. Many\ncontroversies are done away with. The science of Law\nreceives a fresh stimulus. A more uniform spirit enters\ninto the law of the country. New conditions and\ncircumstances of life become legally recognised. Mortifying\nprinciples and branches are cut off with one\nstroke. A great deal of fresh and healthy blood is\nbrought into the arteries of the body of the law in its\ntotality. If codification is carefully planned and prepared,\nif it is imbued with true and healthy conservatism,\nmany disadvantages can be avoided. And interpretation [Pg 42] on the part of good judges can deal with many\na fault that codification has made. If the worst\ncomes to the worst, there is always a Parliament or\nanother law-giving authority of the land to mend\nthrough further legislation the faults of previous\ncodification."

But this disadvantage can be met by\nperiodical revisions of the code and by its gradual\nincrease and improvement through enactment of additional\nand amending rules according to the wants and\nneeds of the days to come.",
                                        "When opponents postulate an international court\nwith power of executing its verdicts as an indispensable\ncondition of codification, I answer that the non-existence [Pg 43] of such a court is quite as much or as little\nan argument against codification as against the very\nexistence of International Law. If there is a Law of\nNations in existence in spite of the non-existence of\nan international court to guarantee its realisation, I\ncannot see why the non-existence of such a court\nshould be an obstacle to codifying the very same Law\nof Nations. It may indeed be maintained that codification\nis all the more necessary as such an international\ncourt does not exist. For codification of the Law of\nNations and the solemn recognition of a code by a\nuniversal law-making international treaty would give\nmore precision, certainty, and weight to the rules of\nthe Law of Nations than they have now in their unwritten\ncondition. And a uniform interpretation of a\ncode is now, since the first Hague Peace Conference\nhas instituted a Permanent Court of Arbitration, and\nsince the second Peace Conference has resolved upon\nthe establishment of an International Prize Court,\nmuch more realisable than in former times, although\nthese courts will never have the power of executing\ntheir verdicts.",
                                        "But is the Law of Nations ripe for codification?\nI readily admit that there are certain parts of that\nlaw which would offer the greatest difficulty, and which\ntherefore had better remain untouched for the present.\nBut there are other parts, and I think that they constitute\nthe greater portion of the Law of Nations,\nwhich are certainly ripe for codification. There can\nbe no doubt that, whatever can be said against codification\nof the whole of the Law of Nations, partial\ncodification is possible and comparatively easy. The\nwork done by the Institute of International Law, and\npublished in the \"Annuaire de l'Institut de Droit\nInternational,\" gives evidence of it. And the number\nand importance of the law-making treaties produced\nby the Hague Peace Conferences and the Maritime [Pg 44] Conference of London, 1908-9, should leave no doubt\nas to the feasibility of such partial codification."

The difficulties, though not\ninsuperable, are so great that it would take the work of\nperhaps a generation of able jurists to prepare draft\ncodes for those parts of International Law which may be\nconsidered ripe for codification. The only way in which\nsuch draft codes could be prepared consists in the\nappointment on the part of the Powers of an international\ncommittee composed of a sufficient number\nof able jurists, whose task would be the preparation\nof the drafts. Public opinion of the whole civilised\nworld would, I am sure, watch the work of these men\nwith the greatest interest, and the Parliaments of the\ncivilised States would gladly vote the comparatively\nsmall sums of money necessary for the costs of the\nwork. But in proposing codification it is necessary to\nemphasise that it does not necessarily involve a reconstruction\nof the present international order and a\nrecasting of the whole system of International Law as\nit at present stands. Naturally, a codification would\nin many points mean not only an addition to the rules\nat present recognised, but also the repeal, alteration, and\nreconstruction of some of these rules. Yet, however\nthis may be, I do not believe that a codification ought\nto be or could be undertaken which would revolutionise\nthe present international order and put the whole\nsystem of International Law on a new basis. The\ncodification which I have in view is one that would\nembody the existing rules of International Law together\nwith such modifications and additions as are\nnecessitated by the conditions of the age and the very\nfact of codification being taken in hand.

International Law as a law between Sovereign\nand equal States based on the common consent\nof these States is a product of modern Christian civilisation,\nand may be said to be hardly four hundred years\nold. However, the roots of this law go very far back\ninto history. Such roots are to be found in the rules\nand usages which were observed by the different nations\nof antiquity with regard to their external relations.\nBut it is well known that the conception of a Family\nof Nations did not arise in the mental horizon of the\nancient world. Each nation had its own religion and\ngods, its own language, law, and morality. International\ninterests of sufficient vigour to wind a band around all [Pg 46] the civilised States, bring them nearer to each other,\nand knit them together into a community of nations,\ndid not spring up in antiquity. On the other hand,\nhowever, no nation could avoid coming into contact\nwith other nations. War was waged and peace concluded.\nTreaties were agreed upon. Occasionally ambassadors\nwere sent and received. International trade\nsprang up. Political partisans whose cause was lost\noften fled their country and took refuge in another.\nAnd, just as in our days, criminals often fled their\ncountry for the purpose of escaping punishment.",

It will be of interest to throw\na glance at the respective rules and usages of the\nJews, Greeks, and Romans."

Although they were monotheists and the\nstandard of their ethics was consequently much higher\nthan that of their heathen neighbours, the Jews did\nnot in fact raise the standard of the international relations\nof their time except so far as they afforded\nforeigners living on Jewish territory equality before\nthe law. Proud of their monotheism and despising\nall other nations on account of their polytheism, they\nfound it totally impossible to recognise other nations\nas equals. If we compare the different parts of the\nBible concerning the relations of the Jews with other\nnations, we are struck by the fact that the Jews were\nsworn enemies of some foreign nations, as the Amalekites,\nfor example, with whom they declined to have\nany relations whatever in peace. When they went to\nwar with those nations, their practice was extremely [Pg 47] cruel. They killed not only the warriors on the battlefield,\nbut also the aged, the women, and the children\nin their homes. Read, for example, the short description\nof the war of the Jews against the Amalekites in\n1 Samuel xv., where we are told that Samuel instructed\nKing Saul as follows: (3) \"Now go and smite Amalek,\nand utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them\nnot; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling,\nox and sheep, camel and ass.\" King Saul obeyed\nthe injunction, save that he spared the life of Agag,\nthe Amalekite king, and some of the finest animals.\nThen we are told that the prophet Samuel rebuked\nSaul and \"hewed Agag in pieces with his own hand.\"\nOr again, in 2 Samuel xii. 31, we find that King David,\n\"the man after God's own heart,\" after the conquest\nof the town of Rabbah, belonging to the Ammonites,\n\"brought forth the people that were therein and put\nthem under saws, and under harrows of iron, and made\nthem pass through the brick-kiln....\"",

And when they went to war with those\nnations, their practice was in no way exceptionally\ncruel, if looked upon from the standpoint of their time\nand surroundings. Thus we find in Deuteronomy xx.\n10-14 the following rules:—",
                                        "(10) \"When thou comest nigh unto a city to fight\nagainst it, then proclaim peace unto it.",
                                        "(11) \"And it shall be, if it make thee answer of\npeace and open unto thee, that all the people that is\nfound therein shall be tributaries unto thee, and they\nshall serve thee.",
                                        "(12) \"And if it will make no peace with thee,\nbut will make war against thee, then thou shalt\nbesiege it.",
                                        "(13) \"And when the Lord thy God hath delivered [Pg 48] it into thine hands, thou shalt smite every male thereof\nwith the edge of the sword.",
                                        "(14) \"But the women, and the little ones, and the\ncattle, and all that is in the city, even all the spoil\nthereof, shalt thou take unto thyself; and thou shalt\neat the spoil of thine enemies, which the Lord thy God\nhath given thee.\"",
                                        "Comparatively mild, like these rules for warfare,\nwere the Jewish rules regarding their foreign slaves.\nSuch slaves were not without legal protection. The\nmaster who killed a slave was punished (Exodus ii.\n20); if the master struck his slave so severely that\nhe lost an eye or a tooth, the slave became a free man\n(Exodus ii. 26 and 27). The Jews, further, allowed\nforeigners to live among them under the full protection\nof their laws. \"Love ... the stranger, for ye were\nstrangers in the land of Egypt,\" says Deuteronomy x.\n19, and in Leviticus xxiv. 22 there is the command:\n\"You shall have one manner of law, as well for the\nstranger as for one of your own country.\"",
                                        "Of the greatest importance, however, for the International\nLaw of the future, are the Messianic ideals\nand hopes of the Jews, as these Messianic ideals and\nhopes are not national only, but fully inter national.\nThe following are the beautiful words in which the\nprophet Isaiah (ii. 2-4) foretells the state of mankind\nwhen the Messiah shall have appeared:",
                                        "(2) \"And it shall come to pass in the last days,\nthat the mountain of the Lord's house shall be established\nin the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted\nabove the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it.",
                                        "(3) \"And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and\nlet us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of\nthe God of Jacob, and he will teach us of his ways, and\nwe will walk in his paths; for out of Zion shall go forth\nthe law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. [Pg 49]",
                                        "(4) \"And he shall judge among the nations, and\nshall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their\nswords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning-hooks:\nnation shall not lift up sword against nation,\nneither shall they learn war any more.\"",
                                        "Thus we see that the Jews, at least at the time of\nIsaiah, had a foreboding and presentiment of a future\nwhen all the nations of the world should be united in\npeace. And the Jews have given this ideal to the Christian\nworld. It is the same ideal which has in bygone\ntimes inspired all those eminent men who have laboured\nto build up an International Law. And it is again\nthe same ideal which nowadays inspires all lovers of\ninternational peace. Although the Jewish State and\nthe Jews as a nation have practically done nothing to\nrealise that ideal, yet it sprang up among them and\nhas never disappeared."

Totally different from this Jewish contribution\nto a future International Law is that of the Greeks.\nThe broad and deep gulf between their civilisation and\nthat of their neighbours necessarily made them look\ndown upon those neighbours as barbarians, and thus\nprevented them from raising the standard of their\nrelations with neighbouring nations above the average\nlevel of antiquity. But the Greeks before the Macedonian\nconquest were never united into one powerful\nnational State. They lived in numerous more or less\nsmall city States, which were totally independent of\none another. It is this very fact which, as time went\non, called into existence a kind of International Law\nbetween these independent States. They could never\nforget that their inhabitants were of the same race.\nThe same blood, the same religion, and the same civilisation\nof their citizens united these independent and—as\nwe should say nowadays—Sovereign States into a\ncommunity of States which in time of peace and war [Pg 50] held themselves bound to observe certain rules as\nregards the relations between one another. The consequence\nwas that the practice of the Greeks in\ntheir wars among themselves was a very mild one.\nIt was a rule that war should never be commenced\nwithout a declaration of war. Heralds were inviolable.\nWarriors who died on the battlefield were entitled to\nburial. If a city was captured, the lives of all those\nwho took refuge in a temple had to be spared. War\nprisoners could be exchanged or ransomed; their lot\nwas, at the utmost, slavery. Certain places, as, for\nexample, the temple of the god Apollo at Delphi, were\npermanently inviolable. Even certain persons in the\narmies of the belligerents were considered inviolable, as,\nfor instance, the priests, who carried the holy fire, and\nthe seers.",
                                        "Thus the Greeks left to history the example that\nindependent and Sovereign States can live, and are\nin reality compelled to live, in a community which\nprovides a law for the international relations of the\nmember-States, provided that there exist some common\ninterests and aims which bind these States together.\nIt is very often maintained that this kind of International\nLaw of the Greek States could in no way be compared\nwith our modern International Law, as the Greeks did\nnot consider their international rules as legally, but as\nreligiously binding only. We must, however, not forget\nthat the Greeks never made the same distinction between\nlaw, religion, and morality which the modern\nworld makes. The fact itself remains unshaken that\nthe Greek States set an example to the future that\nindependent States can live in a community in which\ntheir international regulations are governed by certain\nrules and customs based on the common consent of the\nmembers of that community."

As far back as their history goes, the Romans\nhad a special set of twenty priests, the so-called fetiales ,\nfor the management of functions regarding their relations\nwith foreign nations. In fulfilling their functions\nthe fetiales did not apply a purely secular but a divine\nand holy law, a jus sacrale , the so-called jus fetiale .\nThe fetiales were employed when war was declared or\npeace was made, when treaties of friendship or of alliance\nwere concluded, when the Romans had an international\nclaim before a foreign State, or vice versa .",
                                        "According to Roman Law the relations of the Romans\nwith a foreign State depended upon the fact whether\nor not there existed a treaty of friendship between\nRome and the respective State. In case no such treaty\nwas in existence, persons or goods coming from the\nforeign land into the land of the Romans, and likewise\npersons and goods going from the land of the Romans\ninto the foreign land, enjoyed no legal protection whatever.\nSuch persons could be made slaves, and such\ngoods could be seized, and became the property of the\ncaptor. Should such an enslaved person ever come\nback to his country, he was at once considered a free\nman again according to the so-called jus postliminii .\nAn exception was made as regards ambassadors. They\nwere always considered inviolable, and whoever violated\nthem was handed over to the home State of those ambassadors\nto be punished according to discretion.",
                                        "Different were the relations when a treaty of friendship\nexisted. Persons and goods coming from one\ncountry into the other stood then under legal protection.\nSo many foreigners came in the process of time\nto Rome that a whole system of law sprang up regarding\nthese foreigners and their relations with Roman\ncitizens, the so-called jus gentium in contradistinction\nto the jus civile . And a special magistrate, the praetor [Pg 52] peregrinus , was nominated for the administration of\nthat law. Of such treaties with foreign nations there\nwere three different kinds, namely, of friendship ( amicitia ),\nof hospitality ( hospitium ), or of alliance ( foedus ).\nI do not propose to go into details about them. It\nsuffices to remark that, although the treaties were concluded\nwithout any such provision, notice of termination\ncould be given. Very often these treaties used\nto contain a provision according to which future controversies\ncould be settled by arbitration of the so-called recuperatores .",
                                        "Very precise legal rules existed as regards war and\npeace. Roman law considered war a legal institution.\nThere were four different just reasons for war, namely:\n(1) Violation of the Roman dominion; (2) violation of\nambassadors; (3) violation of treaties; (4) support\ngiven during war to an opponent by a hitherto friendly\nState. But even in such cases war was only justified\nif satisfaction was not given by the foreign State.\nFour fetiales used to be sent as ambassadors to the\nforeign State from which satisfaction was asked. If such\nsatisfaction was refused, war was formally declared by\none of the fetiales throwing a lance from the Roman\nfrontier into the foreign land. For warfare itself no\nlegal rules existed, but discretion only, and there are\nexamples enough of great cruelty on the part of the\nRomans. Legal rules existed, however, for the end of\nwar. War could be ended, first, through a treaty of\npeace, which was then always a treaty of friendship.\nWar could, secondly, be ended by surrender ( deditio ).\nSuch surrender spared the enemy their lives and property.\nWar could, thirdly and lastly, be ended through\nconquest of the enemy's country ( occupatio ). It was in\nthis case that the Romans could act according to discretion\nwith the lives and the property of the enemy.",
                                        "From this sketch of their rules concerning external [Pg 53] relations, it becomes apparent that the Romans gave\nto the future the example of a State with legal rules\nfor its foreign relations. As the legal people par excellence ,\nthe Romans could not leave their international\nrelations without legal treatment. And though this\nlegal treatment can in no way be compared to modern\nInternational Law, yet it constitutes a contribution\nto the Law of Nations of the future, in so far as its\nexample furnished many arguments to those to whose\nefforts we owe the very existence of our modern Law\nof Nations."

And\nmatters did not change when under Constantine the\nGreat (313-337) the Christian faith became the religion\nof the empire and Byzantium its capital instead of\nRome, and, further, when in 395 the Roman Empire\nwas divided into the Eastern and the Western Empire.\nThis Western Empire disappeared in 476, when Romulus\nAugustus, the last emperor, was deposed by Odoacer,\nthe leader of the Germanic soldiers, who made himself\nruler in Italy. The land of the extinct Western Roman\nEmpire came into the hands of different peoples, chiefly\nof Germanic extraction. In Gallia the kingdom of the\nFranks springs up in 486 under Chlodovech the Merovingian.\nIn Italy, the kingdom of the Ostrogoths\nunder Theoderich the Great, who defeated Odoacer,\nrises in 493. In Spain the kingdom of the Visigoths\nappears in 507. The Vandals had, as early as in 429, [Pg 54] erected a kingdom in Africa, with Carthage as its\ncapital. The Saxons had already gained a footing in\nBritannia in 449.",
                                        "All these peoples were barbarians in the strict sense\nof the term. Although they had adopted Christianity,\nit took hundreds of years to raise them to the standard\nof a more advanced civilisation. And, likewise,\nhundreds of years passed before different nations came\nto light out of the amalgamation of the various peoples\nthat had conquered the old Roman Empire with the\nresiduum of the population of that empire. It was in\nthe eighth century that matters became more settled.\nCharlemagne built up his vast Frankish Empire, and\nwas, in 800, crowned Roman Emperor by Pope Leo\nIII. Again the whole world seemed to be one empire,\nheaded by the Emperor as its temporal, and by the\nPope as its spiritual, master, and for an International\nLaw there was therefore no room and no need. But\nthe Frankish Empire did not last long. According to\nthe Treaty of Verdun, it was, in 843, divided into three\nparts, and with that division the process of development\nset in, which led gradually to the rise of the several\nStates of Europe.",
                                        "In theory the Emperor of the Germans remained for\nhundreds of years to come the master of the world,\nbut in practice he was not even master at home, as the\nGerman Princes step by step succeeded in establishing\ntheir independence. And although theoretically the\nworld was well looked after by the Emperor as its temporal\nand the Pope as its spiritual head, there were\nconstantly treachery, quarrelling, and fighting going on.\nWar practice was the most cruel possible. It is true\nthat the Pope and the Bishops succeeded sometimes in\nmitigating such practice, but as a rule there was no\ninfluence of the Christian teaching visible."

The necessity for a Law of Nations did not [Pg 55] arise until a multitude of States absolutely independent\nof one another had successfully established themselves.\nThe process of development, starting from the Treaty\nof Verdun of 843, reached that climax with the reign of\nFrederic III., Emperor of the Germans from 1440 to\n1493. He was the last of the emperors crowned in Rome\nby the hands of the Popes. At that time Europe was,\nin fact, divided up into a great number of independent\nStates, and thenceforth a law was needed to deal with\nthe international relations of these Sovereign States.\nSeven factors of importance prepared the ground for the\ngrowth of principles of a future International Law.",
                                        "(1) There were, first, the Civilians and the Canonists.\nRoman Law was in the beginning of the twelfth century\nbrought back to the West through Irnerius, who taught\nthis law at Bologna. He and the other glossatores and post-glossatores considered Roman Law the ratio scripta ,\nthe law par excellence . These Civilians maintained that\nRoman Law was the law of the civilised world ipso\nfacto through the emperors of the Germans being the\nsuccessors of the emperors of Rome. Their commentaries\nto the Corpus Juris Civilis touch upon many\nquestions of the future International Law which they\ndiscuss from the basis of Roman Law.",
                                        "The Canonists, on the other hand, whose influence\nwas unshaken till the time of the Reformation, treated\nfrom a moral and ecclesiastical point of view many\nquestions of the future International Law concerning\nwar. [35]",
                                        "[Footnote 35: See\n Holland, Studies, pp. 40-58; Walker, History, I. pp. 204-212.]",

From the\neighth century the world trade, which had totally disappeared\nin consequence of the downfall of the Roman\nEmpire and the destruction of the old civilisation [Pg 56] during the period of the Migration of the Peoples,\nbegan slowly to develop again. The sea trade specially\nflourished and fostered the growth of rules and customs\nof Maritime Law, which were collected into codes and\ngained some kind of international recognition. The\nmore important of these collections are the following:\nThe Consolato del Mare , a private collection made at\nBarcelona in Spain in the middle of the fourteenth\ncentury; the Laws of Oléron , a collection, made in the\ntwelfth century, of decisions given by the maritime\ncourt of Oléron in France; the Rhodian Laws , a very\nold collection of maritime laws which probably was put\ntogether between the sixth and the eighth centuries; [36] the Tabula Amalfitana , the maritime laws of the town\nof Amalfi in Italy, which date at latest from the tenth\ncentury; the Leges Wisbuenses , a collection of maritime\nlaws of Wisby on the island of Gothland, in Sweden,\ndating from the fourteenth century.",

                                        "The growth of international trade caused also the\nrise of the controversy regarding the freedom of the\nhigh seas (see\n  below, § 248 ), which indirectly influenced\nthe growth of an International Law (see\n  below, §§ 248 -250).",
                                        "(3) A third factor was the numerous leagues of\ntrading towns for the protection of their trade and\ntrading citizens. The most celebrated of these leagues\nis the Hanseatic, formed in the thirteenth century.\nThese leagues stipulated for arbitration on controversies\nbetween their member towns. They acquired trading\nprivileges in foreign States. They even waged war,\nwhen necessary, for the protection of their interests.",
                                        "(4) A fourth factor was the growing custom on the\npart of the States of sending and receiving permanent\nlegations. In the Middle Ages the Pope alone had a\npermanent legation at the court of the Frankish kings. [Pg 57] Later, the Italian Republics, as Venice and Florence for\ninstance, were the first States to send out ambassadors,\nwho took up their residence for several years in the\ncapitals of the States to which they were sent. At last,\nfrom the end of the fifteenth century, it became a universal\ncustom for the kings of the different States to\nkeep permanent legations at one another's capital.\nThe consequence was that an uninterrupted opportunity\nwas given for discussing and deliberating common\ninternational interests. And since the position of\nambassadors in foreign countries had to be taken into\nconsideration, international rules concerning inviolability\nand exterritoriality of foreign envoys gradually\ngrew up.",
                                        "(5) A fifth factor was the custom of the great States\nof keeping standing armies, a custom which also dates\nfrom the fifteenth century. The uniform and stern\ndiscipline in these armies favoured the rise of more\nuniversal rules and practices of warfare.",
                                        "(6) A sixth factor was the Renaissance and the\nReformation. The Renaissance of science and art in\nthe fifteenth century, together with the resurrection of\nthe knowledge of antiquity, revived the philosophical\nand aesthetical ideals of Greek life and transferred\nthem to modern life. Through their influence the\nspirit of the Christian religion took precedence of its\nletter. The conviction awoke everywhere that the\nprinciples of Christianity ought to unite the Christian\nworld more than they had done hitherto, and that\nthese principles ought to be observed in matters international\nas much as in matters national. The Reformation,\non the other hand, put an end to the spiritual\nmastership of the Pope over the civilised world. Protestant\nStates could not recognise the claim of the Pope\nto arbitrate as of right in their conflicts either between\none another or between themselves and Catholic States. [Pg 58]",
                                        "(7) A seventh factor made its appearance in connection\nwith the schemes for the establishment of eternal\npeace which arose from the beginning of the fourteenth\ncentury. Although these schemes were utopian, they\nnevertheless must have had great influence by impressing\nupon the Princes and the nations of Christendom\nthe necessity for some kind of organisation of the\nnumerous independent States into a community. The\nfirst of these schemes was that of the French lawyer,\nPierre Dubois, who, as early as 1306, in \"De Recuperatione\nTerre Sancte\" proposed an alliance between all\nChristian Powers for the purpose of the maintenance of\npeace and the establishment of a Permanent Court of\nArbitration for the settlement of differences between\nthe members of the alliance. [37] Another project arose in\n1461, when Podiebrad, King of Bohemia from 1420-1471,\nadopted the scheme of his Chancellor, Antoine\nMarini, and negotiated with foreign courts the foundation\nof a Federal State to consist of all the existing\nChristian States with a permanent Congress, seated at\nBasle, of ambassadors of all the member States as the\nhighest organ of the Federation. [38] A third plan was\nthat of Sully, adopted by Henri IV. of France, which\nproposed the division of Europe into fifteen States and\nthe linking together of these into a federation with a\nGeneral Council as its highest organ, consisting of\nCommissioners deputed by the member States. [39] A\nfourth project was that of Émeric Crucée, who, in 1623,\nproposed the establishment of a Union consisting not\nonly of the Christian States but of all States then existing [Pg 59] in the whole of the world, with a General Council\nas its highest organ, seated at Venice, and consisting\nof ambassadors of all the member States of the Union.

Many interests\nand aims knitted these States together into a\ncommunity of States. International lawlessness was\nhenceforth an impossibility. This was the reason for\nthe fact that Grotius's work \"De Jure Belli ac Pacis [Pg 60] libri III.,\" which appeared in 1625, won the ear of the\ndifferent States, their rulers, and their writers on matters\ninternational. Since a Law of Nations was now a\nnecessity, since many principles of such a law were\nalready more or less recognised and appeared again\namong the doctrines of Grotius, since the system of\nGrotius supplied a legal basis to most of those\ninternational relations which were at the time considered\nas wanting such basis, the book of Grotius\nobtained such a world-wide influence that he is correctly\nstyled the \"Father of the Law of Nations.\" It\nwould be very misleading and in no way congruent with\nthe facts of history to believe that Grotius's doctrines\nwere as a body at once universally accepted. No such\nthing happened, nor could have happened. What did\nsoon take place was that, whenever an international\nquestion of legal importance arose, Grotius's book was\nconsulted, and its authority was so overwhelming that\nin many cases its rules were considered right. How\nthose rules of Grotius, which have more or less quickly\nbeen recognised by the common consent of the writers\non International Law, have gradually received similar\nacceptance at the hands of the Family of Nations is\na process of development which in each single phase\ncannot be ascertained. It can only be stated that at\nthe end of the seventeenth century the civilised States\nconsidered themselves bound by a Law of Nations the\nrules of which were to a great extent the rules of Grotius.\nThis does not mean that these rules have from the end\nof that century never been broken. On the contrary,\nthey have frequently been broken. But whenever this\noccurred, the States concerned maintained either that\nthey did not intend to break these rules, or that their\nacts were in harmony with them, or that they were\njustified by just causes and circumstances in breaking\nthem. And the development of the Law of Nations did [Pg 61] not come to a standstill with the reception of the bulk\nof the rules of Grotius. More and more rules were\ngradually required and therefore gradually grew. All\nthe historically important events and facts of international\nlife from the time of Grotius down to our own\nhave, on the one hand, given occasion to the manifestation\nof the existence of a Law of Nations, and, on the\nother hand, in their turn made the Law of Nations\nconstantly and gradually develop into a more perfect\nand more complete system of legal rules.",

The ending of the Thirty Years' War through\nthe Westphalian Peace of 1648 is the first event of\ngreat importance after the death of Grotius in 1645.\nWhat makes remarkable the meetings of Osnaburg,\nwhere the Protestant Powers met, and Münster, where\nthe Catholic Powers met, is the fact that there was for\nthe first time in history a European Congress assembled\nfor the purpose of settling matters international by\ncommon consent of the Powers. With the exception of\nEngland, Russia, and Poland, all the important Christian\nStates were represented at this congress, as were\nalso the majority of the minor Powers. The arrangements\nmade by this congress show what a great change\nhad taken place in the condition of matters international.\nThe Swiss Confederation and the Netherlands were\nrecognised as independent States. The 355 different\nStates which belonged to the German Empire were\npractically, although not theoretically, recognised as\nindependent States which formed a Confederation under\nthe Emperor as its head. Of these 355 States, 150\nwere secular States governed by hereditary monarchs [Pg 62] (Electors, Dukes, Landgraves, and the like), 62 were\nfree-city States, and 123 were ecclesiastical States\ngoverned by archbishops and other Church dignitaries.\nThe theory of the unity of the civilised world under\nthe German Emperor and the Pope as its temporal and\nspiritual heads respectively was buried for ever. A multitude\nof recognised independent States formed a community\non the basis of equality of all its members. The\nconception of the European equilibrium [41] made its\nappearance and became an implicit principle as a\nguaranty of the independence of the members of the\nFamily of Nations. Protestant States took up their\nposition within this family along with Catholic States,\nas did republics along with monarchies.",

But Louis XIV. always pleaded\na just cause when he made war, and even the establishment\nof the ill-famed so-called Chambers of Reunion\n(1680-1683) was done under the pretext of law.\nThere was no later period in history in which the principles\nof International Law were more frivolously\nviolated, but the violation was always cloaked by some\nexcuse. Five treaties of peace between France and\nother Powers during the reign of Louis XIV. are of\ngreat importance. (1) The Peace of the Pyrenees,\nwhich ended in 1659 the war between France and Spain,\nwho had not come to terms at the Westphalian Peace.\n(2) The Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, which ended in 1668\nanother war between France and Spain, commenced in\n1667 because France claimed the Spanish Netherlands\nfrom Spain. This peace was forced upon Louis XIV.\nthrough the triple alliance between England, Holland,\nand Sweden. (3) The Peace of Nymeguen, which ended\nin 1678 the war originally commenced by Louis XIV. [Pg 63] in 1672 against Holland, into which many other\nEuropean Powers were drawn. (4) The Peace of Ryswick,\nwhich ended in 1697 the war that had existed\nsince 1688 between France on one side, and, on the\nother, England, Holland, Denmark, Germany, Spain,\nand Savoy. (5) The Peace of Utrecht, 1713, and the\nPeace of Rastadt and Baden, 1714, which ended the war\nof the Spanish Succession that had lasted since 1701\nbetween France and Spain on the one side, and, on the\nother, England, Holland, Portugal, Germany, and Savoy.",

The following treaties\nof peace must therefore be mentioned:—(1) The Peaces\nof Roeskild (1658), Oliva (1660), Copenhagen (also 1660),\nand Kardis (1661). The contracting Powers were\nSweden, Denmark, Poland, Prussia, and Russia. (2)\nThe Peace of Carlowitz, 1699, between Turkey, Austria,\nPoland, and Venice.

                                        "The year 1721 is epoch-making because with the\nPeace of Nystaedt Russia enters as a member into the\nFamily of Nations, in which she at once held the position\nof a Great Power. The period ended by the year\n1721 shows in many points progressive tendencies\nregarding the Law of Nations. Thus the right of visit\nand search on the part of belligerents over neutral\nvessels becomes recognised. The rule \"free ships, free\ngoods,\" rises as a postulate, although it was not universally\nrecognised till 1856. The effectiveness of\nblockades, which were first made use of in war by the\nNetherlands at the end of the sixteenth century, rose\nas a postulate and became recognised in treaties between\nHolland and Sweden (1667) and Holland and England\n(1674), although its universal recognition was not realised\nuntil the nineteenth century. The freedom of the\nhigh seas, claimed by Grotius and others, began gradually [Pg 64] to obtain recognition in practice, although it did\nlikewise not meet with universal acceptance till the\nnineteenth century.

A kingdom of the Netherlands was\ncreated out of Holland and Belgium. Norway and\nSweden became a Real Union.

                                        "§ 51. It is the task of history, not only to show how\nthings have grown in the past, but also to extract a\nmoral for the future out of the events of the past. Six\nmorals can be said to be deduced from the history of\nthe development of the Law of Nations:",
                                        "(1) The first and principal moral is that a Law of\nNations can exist only if there be an equilibrium, a\nbalance of power, between the members of the Family\nof Nations. If the Powers cannot keep one another\nin check, no rules of law will have any force, since an\nover-powerful State will naturally try to act according\nto discretion and disobey the law. As there is not\nand never can be a central political authority above the\nSovereign States that could enforce the rules of the\nLaw of Nations, a balance of power must prevent any\nmember of the Family of Nations from becoming omnipotent.\nThe history of the times of Louis XIV. and\nNapoleon I. shows clearly the soundness of this principle. [68]",
                                        "[Footnote 68: Attention ought to be drawn to the fact that, although the\nnecessity of a balance of power is generally recognised, there are some\nwriters of great authority who vigorously oppose this principle, as, for\ninstance, Bulmerincq, \"Praxis, Theorie und Codification des\nVölkerrechts\" (1874), pp. 40-50. On the principle itself see Donnadieu,\n\"Essai sur la Théorie de l'Équilibre\" (1900), and Dupuis, \"Le Principe\nd'Équilibre et de Concert Européen\" (1909).]",
                                        "(2) The second moral is that International Law can\ndevelop progressively only when international politics, [Pg 81] especially intervention, are made on the basis of real\nState interests. Dynastic wars belong to the past, as\ndo interventions in favour of legitimacy. It is neither\nto be feared, nor to be hoped, that they should occur\nagain in the future. But if they did, they would hamper\nthe development of the Law of Nations in the future as\nthey have done in the past.",
                                        "(3) The third moral is that the principle of nationality\nis of such force that it is fruitless to try to stop its\nvictory. Wherever a community of many millions of\nindividuals, who are bound together by the same blood,\nlanguage, and interests, become so powerful that they\nthink it necessary to have a State of their own, in which\nthey can live according to their own ideals and can\nbuild up a national civilisation, they will certainly get\nthat State sooner or later. What international politics\ncan, and should, do is to enforce the rule that minorities\nof individuals of another race shall not be outside the\nlaw, but shall be treated on equal terms with the majority.\nStates embracing a population of several nationalities\ncan exist and will always exist, as many examples show.",
                                        "(4) The fourth moral is that every progress in the\ndevelopment of International Law wants due time to\nripen. Although one must hope that the time will\ncome when war will entirely disappear, there is no\npossibility of seeing this hope realised in our time. The\nfirst necessities of an eternal peace are that the surface\nof the earth should be shared between States of the\nsame standard of civilisation, and that the moral ideas\nof the governing classes in all the States of the world\nshould undergo such an alteration and progressive development\nas would create the conviction that arbitral\nawards and decisions of courts of justice are alone\nadequate means for the settlement of international\ndifferences. Eternal peace is an ideal, and in the\nvery term \"ideal\" is involved the conviction of the\nimpossibility of its realisation in the present, although [Pg 82] it is a duty to aim constantly at such realisation. The\nPermanent Court of Arbitration at the Hague, now\nestablished by the Hague Peace Conference of 1899, is\nan institution that can bring us nearer to such realisation\nthan ever could have been hoped. And codification\nof parts of the Law of Nations, following the codification\nof the rules regarding land warfare and the\ncodification comprised in the Declaration of London,\nwill in due time arrive, and will make the legal basis of\ninternational intercourse firmer, broader, and more\nmanifest than before. [69]",
                                        "[Footnote 69: See\n Oppenheim, \"Die Zukunft des Völkerrechts\" (1911) where\nsome progressive steps are discussed which the future may realise.]",
                                        "(5) The fifth moral is that the progress of International\nLaw depends to a great extent upon whether\nthe legal school of International Jurists prevails over\nthe diplomatic school. [70] The legal school desires International\nLaw to develop more or less on the lines of\nMunicipal Law, aiming at the codification of firm, decisive,\nand unequivocal rules of International Law, and\nworking for the establishment of international Courts\nfor the purpose of the administration of international\njustice. The diplomatic school, on the other hand,\nconsiders International Law to be, and prefers it to\nremain, rather a body of elastic principles than of firm\nand precise rules. The diplomatic school opposes the\nestablishment of international Courts because it considers\ndiplomatic settlement of international disputes,\nand failing this arbitration, preferable to international\nadministration of justice by international Courts composed\nof permanently appointed judges. There is, however,\nno doubt that international Courts are urgently\nneeded, and that the rules of International Law require\nnow such an authoritative interpretation and administration\nas only an international Court can supply.",
                                        "[Footnote 70: I name these schools \"diplomatic\" and \"legal\" for want of\nbetter denomination. They must, however, not be confounded with the\nthree schools of the \"Naturalists,\" \"Positivists,\" and \"Grotians,\"\ndetails concerning which will be given below, §§ 55-57. [Pg 83]]",
                                        "(6) The sixth, and last, moral is that the progressive\ndevelopment of International Law depends chiefly upon\nthe standard of public morality on the one hand, and,\non the other, upon economic interests. The higher the\nstandard of public morality rises, the more will International\nLaw progress. And the more important international\neconomic interests grow, the more International\nLaw will grow. For, looked upon from a certain stand-point,\nInternational Law is, just like Municipal Law, a\nproduct of moral and of economic factors, and at the\nsame time the basis for a favourable development of\nmoral and economic interests. This being an indisputable\nfact, it may, therefore, fearlessly be maintained\nthat an immeasurable progress is guaranteed to International\nLaw, since there are eternal moral and economic\nfactors working in its favour."

He first practised\nas a lawyer, but afterwards took to politics and became\ninvolved in political and religious quarrels which led to\nhis arrest in 1618 and condemnation to prison for life.\nIn 1621, however, he succeeded in escaping from prison\nand went to live for ten years in France. In 1634 he\nentered into the service of Sweden and became Swedish\nMinister in Paris. He died in 1645 at Rostock in Germany\non his way home from Sweden, whither he had\ngone to tender his resignation.",
                                        "Even before he had the intention of writing a book\non the Law of Nations Grotius took an interest in matters\ninternational. For in 1609, when only twenty-four\nyears old, he published—anonymously at first—a short\ntreatise under the title \"Mare liberum,\" in which he\ncontended that the open sea could not be the property\nof any State, whereas the contrary opinion was generally\nprevalent. [73] But it was not until fourteen years [Pg 86] later that Grotius began, during his exile in France, to\nwrite his \"De Jure Belli ac Pacis libri III.,\" which was\npublished, after a further two years, in 1625, and of\nwhich it has rightly been maintained that no other\nbook, with the single exception of the Bible, has ever\nexercised a similar influence upon human minds and\nmatters. The whole development of the modern Law\nof Nations itself, as well as that of the science of the\nLaw of Nations, takes root from this for ever famous\nbook. Grotius's intention was originally to write a\ntreatise on the Law of War, since the cruelties and lawlessness\nof warfare of his time incited him to the work.\nBut thorough investigation into the matter led him\nfurther, and thus he produced a system of the Law of\nNature and Nations. In the introduction he speaks of\nmany of the authors before him, and he especially\nquotes Ayala and Gentilis. Yet, although he recognises\ntheir influence upon his work, he is nevertheless\naware that his system is fundamentally different from\nthose of his forerunners. There was in truth nothing\noriginal in Grotius's start from the Law of Nature for\nthe purpose of deducing therefrom rules of a Law of\nNations. Other writers before his time, and in especial\nGentilis, had founded their works upon it. But nobody\nbefore him had done it in such a masterly way and with\nsuch a felicitous hand. And it is on this account that\nGrotius bears not only, as already mentioned, the title\nof \"Father of the Law of Nations,\" but also that of\n\"Father of the Law of Nature.\"",
                                        "[Footnote 73: See\n details with regard to the controversy concerning the\nfreedom of the open sea\n below, §§ 248 -250. Grotius's treatise \"Mare\nliberum\" is—as we know now—the twelfth chapter of the work \"De jure\npraedae,\" written in 1604 but never published by Grotius; it was not\nprinted till 1868. See\n below, § 250 .]",
                                        "Grotius, as a child of his time, could not help starting\nfrom the Law of Nature, since his intention was to find\nsuch rules of a Law of Nations as were eternal, unchangeable,\nand independent of the special consent of\nthe single States. Long before Grotius, the opinion was\ngenerally prevalent that above the positive law, which\nhad grown up by custom or by legislation of a State, [Pg 87] there was in existence another law which had its roots\nin human reason and which could therefore be discovered\nwithout any knowledge of positive law. This\nlaw of reason was called Law of Nature or Natural Law.\nBut the system of the Law of Nature which Grotius\nbuilt up and from which he started when he commenced\nto build up the Law of Nations, became the most important\nand gained the greatest influence, so that\nGrotius appeared to posterity as the Father of the Law\nof Nature as well as that of the Law of Nations.",
                                        "Whatever we may nowadays think of this Law of\nNature, the fact remains unshaken that for more than\ntwo hundred years after Grotius jurists, philosophers,\nand theologians firmly believed in it. And there is\nno doubt that, but for the systems of the Law of Nature\nand the doctrines of its prophets, the modern Constitutional\nLaw and the modern Law of Nations would\nnot be what they actually are. The Law of Nature\nsupplied the crutches with whose help history has\ntaught mankind to walk out of the institutions of the\nMiddle Ages into those of modern times. The modern\nLaw of Nations in especial owes its very existence [74] to\nthe theory of the Law of Nature. Grotius did not deny\nthat there existed in his time already a good many\ncustomary rules for the international conduct of the\nStates, but he expressly kept them apart from those\nrules which he considered the outcome of the Law of\nNature. He distinguishes, therefore, between the natural Law of Nations on the one hand, and, on the other hand,\nthe customary Law of Nations, which he calls the voluntary Law of Nations. The bulk of Grotius's interest is\nconcentrated upon the natural Law of Nations, since\nhe considered the voluntary of minor importance. But\nnevertheless he does not quite neglect the voluntary [Pg 88] Law of Nations. Although he mainly and chiefly lays\ndown the rules of the natural Law of Nations, he always\nmentions also voluntary rules concerning the different\nmatters.",

A prolific writer, the book through which he\nacquired the title of \"Second founder of the Law of\nNations,\" appeared in 1650 and bears the title: \"Juris\net judicii fecialis, sive juris inter gentes, et quaestionum\nde eodem explicatio, qua, quae ad pacem et bellum inter\ndiversos principes aut populos spectant, ex praecipuis\nhistorico jure peritis exhibentur.\" This little book has\nrightly been called the first manual of the positive Law\nof Nations.

The Science of the Law of Nations, as left by\nthe French Revolution, developed progressively during\nthe nineteenth century under the influence of three\nfactors. The first factor is the endeavour, on the\nwhole sincere, of the Powers since the Congress of Vienna\nto submit to the rules of the Law of Nations. The\nsecond factor is the many law-making treaties which\narose during this century. And the last, but not indeed\nthe least factor, is the downfall of the theory of the Law\nof Nature, which after many hundreds of years has at\nlast been shaken off during the second half of this\ncentury.",
                                        "When the nineteenth century opens, the three schools\nof the Naturalists, the Positivists, and the Grotians are\nstill in the field, but Positivism [84] gains slowly and\ngradually the upper hand, until at the end it may be\nsaid to be victorious, without, however, being omnipotent.\nThe most important writer [85] up to 1836 is\nKlüber, who may be called a Positivist in the same\nsense as Martens, for he also applies the natural Law\nof Nations to fill up the gaps of the positive. Wheaton\nappears in 1836 with his \"Elements,\" and, although an\nAmerican, at once attracts the attention of the whole\nof Europe. He may be called a Grotian. And the\nsame may be maintained of Manning, whose treatise\nappeared in 1839, and is the first that attempts a survey\nof British practice regarding sea warfare based on the\njudgments of Sir William Scott (Lord Stowell). Heffter,\nwhose book appeared in 1844, is certainly a Positivist,\nalthough he does not absolutely deny the Law of Nature.\nIn exact application of the juristic method, Heffter's\nbook excels all former ones, and all the following authors [Pg 99] are in a sense standing on his shoulders. In Phillimore,\nGreat Britain sends in 1854 a powerful author into the\narena, who may, on the whole, be called a Positivist of\nthe same kind as Martens and Klüber. Generations to\ncome will consult Phillimore's volumes on account of\nthe vast amount of material they contain and the sound\njudgment they exhibit. And the same is valid with\nregard to Sir Travers Twiss, whose first volume appeared\nin 1861. Halleck's work, which appeared in\nthe same year, is of special importance as regards war,\nbecause the author, who was a General in the service\nof the United States, gave to this part his special attention.\nThe next prominent author, the Italian Fiore,\nwho published his system in 1865 and may be called a\nGrotian, is certainly the most prominent Italian author,\nand the new edition of his work will for a long time to\ncome be consulted. Bluntschli, the celebrated Swiss-German\nauthor, published his book in 1867; it must,\nin spite of the world-wide fame of its author, be consulted\nwith caution, because it contains many rules\nwhich are not yet recognised rules of the Law of Nations.\nCalvo's work, which first appeared in 1868, contains an\ninvaluable store of facts and opinions, but its juristic\nbasis is not very exact.",
                                        "[Footnote 84: Austin and his followers who hold that the rules of\nInternational Law are rules of \"positive morality\" must be considered\nPositivists, although they do not agree to International Law being real\nlaw.]",
                                        "[Footnote 85: I do not intend to discuss the merits of writers on special\nsubjects, and I mention only the authors of the most important treatises\nwhich are written in, or translated into, English, French, or German.]",
                                        "From the seventies of the nineteenth century the\ninfluence of the downfall of the theory of the Law of\nNature becomes visible in the treatises on the Law of\nNations, and therefore real positivistic treatises make\ntheir appearance. For the Positivism of Zouche,\nBynkershoek, Martens, Klüber, Heffter, Phillimore, and\nTwiss was no real Positivism, since these authors recognised\na natural Law of Nations, although they did not\nmake much use of it. Real Positivism must entirely\navoid a natural Law of Nations. We know nowadays\nthat a Law of Nature does not exist. Just as the so-called\nNatural Philosophy had to give way to real [Pg 100] natural science, so the Law of Nature had to give way\nto jurisprudence, or the philosophy of the positive law.\nOnly a positive Law of Nations can be a branch of the\nscience of law.",
                                        "The first real positive treatise known to me is Hartmann's\n\"Institutionen des praktischen Völkerrechts in\nFriedenszeiten,\" which appeared in 1874, but is hardly\nknown outside Germany. In 1880 Hall's treatise appeared,\nand at once won the attention of the whole\nworld; it is one of the best books on the Law of\nNations that have ever been written. Lorimer, whose\ntwo volumes appeared in 1883 and 1884, is a Naturalist\npure and simple, but his work is nevertheless\nof value. The Russian Martens, whose two volumes\nappeared in German and French translations in 1883\nand at once put their author in the forefront of\nthe authorities, certainly intends to be a real Positivist,\nbut traces of Natural Law are nevertheless\nnow and then to be found in his book. A work of a\nspecial kind is that of Holtzendorff, the first volume\nof which appeared in 1885. Holtzendorff himself is the\neditor and at the same time a contributor to the work,\nbut there are many other contributors, each of them\ndealing exhaustively with a different part of the Law\nof Nations. The copious work of Pradier-Fodéré,\nwhich also began to appear in 1885, is far from being\npositive, although it has its merits. Wharton's three\nvolumes, which appeared in 1886, are not a treatise,\nbut contain the international practice of the United\nStates. Bulmerincq's book, which appeared in 1887,\ngives a good survey of International Law from the\npositive point of view. In 1894 three French jurists,\nBonfils, Despagnet, and Piédelievre, step into the arena;\ntheir treatises are comprehensive and valuable, but not\nabsolutely positive. On the other hand, the English\nauthors Lawrence and Walker, whose excellent manuals [Pg 101] appeared in 1895, are real Positivists. Of the greatest\nvalue are the two volumes of Rivier which appeared\nin 1896; they are full of sound judgment, and will\ninfluence the theory and practice of International Law\nfor a long time to come. Liszt's short manual, which\nin its first edition made its appearance in 1898, is positive\nthroughout, well written, and suggestive. Ullmann's\nwork, which likewise appeared in its first edition\nin 1898, is an excellent and comprehensive treatise\nwhich thoroughly discusses all the more important\nproblems and points from the positive standpoint.\nHannis Taylor's comprehensive treatise, which appeared\nin 1901, is likewise thoroughly positive, and\nso are the serviceable manuals of Wilson and Maxey.\nOf great value are the two volumes of Westlake which\nappeared in 1904 and 1907; they represent rather\na collection of thorough monographs than a treatise,\nand will have great and lasting influence. A work\nof particular importance is the \"Digest\" of John\nBasset Moore, which appeared in 1906, comprises\neight volumes, and contains the international practice\nof the United States in a much more exhaustive form\nthan the work of Wharton; it is an invaluable work\nwhich must be consulted on every subject. The same\nis valid with regard to the three volumes of Nys, who\nmay be characterised as a Grotian, and whose work is\nfull of information on the historical and literary side\nof the problems. [86]",

If we look at the matter as\nit really stands, we observe that they actually often\nenjoy in many points the rights and fulfil in other points\nthe duties of International Persons.

[Pg 110] No other explanation of these and similar facts can be\ngiven except that these not-full Sovereign States are\nin some way or another International Persons and\nsubjects of International Law. Such imperfect International\nPersonality is, of course, an anomaly; but the\nvery existence of States without full sovereignty is an\nanomaly in itself.

So anomalous are these not-full Sovereign\nStates that no hard-and-fast general rule can be laid\ndown with regard to their position within the Family\nof Nations, since everything depends upon the special\ncase. What may be said in general concerning all the\nStates without full sovereignty is that their position\nwithin the Family of Nations, if any, is always more\nor less overshadowed by other States. But their partial\ncharacter of International Persons comes clearly to light\nwhen they are compared with so-called Colonial States,\nsuch as the Dominion of Canada or the Commonwealth\nof Australia. Colonial States have no international\nposition [90] whatever; they are, from the standpoint of\nthe Law of Nations, nothing else than colonial portions\nof the mother-country, although they enjoy perfect\nself-government, and may therefore in a sense be called\nStates. The deciding factor is that their Governor,\nwho has a veto, is appointed by the mother-country, and\nthat the Parliament of the mother-country could withdraw\nself-government from its Colonial States and\nlegislate directly for them.",

Thus the highest\ncourts were called Cours Souverains . Bodin, however,\ngave quite a new meaning to the old conception. Being\nunder the influence and in favour of the policy of centralisation\ninitiated by Louis XI. of France (1461-1483),\nthe founder of French absolutism, he defined sovereignty\nas \"the absolute and perpetual power within a State.\"\nSuch power is the supreme power within a State without\nany restriction whatever except the Commandments\nof God and the Law of Nature. No constitution\ncan limit sovereignty, which is an attribute of the king [Pg 112] in a monarchy and of the people in a democracy. A\nSovereign is above positive law.

Thus at once a somewhat weaker\nconception of sovereignty than that of Bodin made its\nappearance. On the other hand, in the seventeenth\ncentury, Hobbes went even beyond Bodin, maintaining [94] that a Sovereign was not bound by anything and had\na right over everything, even over religion. Whereas a\ngood many publicists followed Hobbes, others, especially\nPufendorf, denied, in contradistinction to Hobbes, that\nsovereignty includes omnipotence. According to Pufendorf,\nsovereignty is the supreme power in a State, but\nnot absolute power, and sovereignty may well be constitutionally\nrestricted. [95] Yet in spite of all the differences\nin defining sovereignty, all authors of the sixteenth\nand seventeenth centuries agree that sovereignty is\nindivisible and contains the centralisation of all power\nin the hands of the Sovereign, whether a monarch or\nthe people itself in a republic. Yet the way for another\nconception of sovereignty is prepared by Locke, whose\n\"Two Treatises on Government\" appeared in 1689,\nand paved the way for the doctrine that the State itself\nis the original Sovereign, and that all supreme powers\nof the Government are derived from this sovereignty\nof the State.",

The fact that the several hundred reigning [Pg 113] princes of the member-States of the German Empire\nhad practically, although not theoretically, become\nmore or less independent since the Westphalian Peace\nenforced the necessity upon publicists to recognise\na distinction between an absolute, perfect, full sovereignty,\non the one hand, and, on the other, a relative,\nimperfect, not-full or half-sovereignty. Absolute and\nfull sovereignty was attributed to those monarchs who\nenjoyed an unqualified independence within and without\ntheir States. Relative and not-full sovereignty, or\nhalf-sovereignty, was attributed to those monarchs who\nwere, in various points of internal or foreign affairs of\nState, more or less dependent upon other monarchs.\nBy this distinction the divisibility of sovereignty was\nrecognised. And when in 1787 the United States of\nAmerica turned from a Confederation of States into a\nFederal State, the division of sovereignty between the\nSovereign Federal State and the Sovereign member-States\nappeared.

Sovereignty, we say\nnowadays, is a natural attribute of every State as a\nState. But a State, as a Juristic Person, wants organs\nto exercise its powers. The organ or organs which\nexercise for the State powers connected with sovereignty\nare said to be sovereign themselves, yet it is obvious\nthat this sovereignty of the organ is derived from the\nsovereignty of the State. And it is likewise obvious\nthat the sovereignty of a State may be exercised by the\ncombined action of several organs, as, for instance, in\nGreat Britain, King and Parliament are the joint administrators\nof the sovereignty of the State.

And it would be equally wrong to\nmaintain either that a Vassal State cannot be in any way\na separate International Person of its own, or that it is\nan International Person of the same kind as any other\nState. What makes the matter so complicated, is the\nfact that a general rule regarding the relation between\nthe suzerain and vassal, and, further, regarding the\nposition, if any, of the vassal within the Family of\nNations, cannot be laid down, as everything depends\nupon the special case. What can and must be said is [Pg 141] that there are some States in existence which, although\nthey are independent of another State as regards their\ninternal affairs, are as regards their international affairs\neither absolutely or for the most part dependent upon\nanother State. They are called half-Sovereign [137] States\nbecause they are sovereign within their borders but not\nwithout.

With the disappearance of the feudal\nsystem, suzerainty of this kind likewise disappeared.\nModern suzerainty contains only a few rights of the\nSuzerain State over the Vassal State which can be\ncalled constitutional rights. The rights of the Suzerain\nState over the Vassal are principally international\nrights, of whatever they may consist. Suzerainty is by\nno means sovereignty. If it were, the Vassal State\ncould not be Sovereign in its domestic affairs and could\nnever have any international relations whatever of its\nown. And why should suzerainty be distinguished\nfrom sovereignty if it be a term synonymous with\nsovereignty?

The fact that the relation between the suzerain\nand the vassal always depends upon the special case,\nexcludes the possibility of laying down a general rule\nas regards the position of Vassal States within the Family [Pg 142] of Nations. It is certain that a Vassal State as such\nneed not have any position whatever within the Family\nof Nations. In every case in which a Vassal State has\nabsolutely no relations whatever with other States,\nsince the suzerain absorbs these relations entirely, such\nvassal remains nevertheless a half-Sovereign State on\naccount of its internal independence, but it has no position\nwhatever within the Family of Nations, and consequently\nis for no part whatever an International Person\nand a subject of International Law. This is the position\nof the Indian Vassal States of Great Britain, which have\nno international relations whatever either between themselves\nor with foreign States. [138] Yet instances can be\ngiven which demonstrate that Vassal States can have\nsome small and subordinate position within that family,\nand that they must in consequence thereof in some few\npoints be considered as International Persons. Thus\nEgypt can conclude commercial and postal treaties with\nforeign States without the consent of suzerain Turkey,\nand Bulgaria could, while she was under Turkish Suzerainty,\nconclude treaties regarding railways, post, and\nthe like. Thus, further, Egypt can send and receive\nconsuls as diplomatic agents, and so could Bulgaria\nwhile she was a Turkish Vassal State. Thus, thirdly,\nthe former South African Republic, although in the\nopinion of Great Britain under her suzerainty, could\nconclude all kinds of treaties with other States, provided\nGreat Britain did not interpose a veto within six\nmonths after receiving a copy of the draft treaty, and\nwas absolutely independent in concluding treaties with\nthe neighbouring Orange Free State. Again, Egypt\npossesses, since 1898, together with Great Britain condominium [139] over the Soudan, which means that they [Pg 143] exercise conjointly sovereignty over this territory.\nAlthough Vassal States have not the right to make war\nindependently of their suzerain, Bulgaria, at the time a\nVassal State, nevertheless fought a war against the full-Sovereign\nServia in 1885, and Egypt conquered the\nSoudan conjointly with Great Britain in 1898.",

Since a neutralised State is under the obligation\nnot to make war against any other State, except\nwhen attacked, and not to conclude treaties of alliance,\nguaranty, and the like, it is frequently maintained that\nneutralised States are part-Sovereign only and not\nInternational Persons of the same position within the\nFamily of Nations as other States. This opinion has,\nhowever, no basis if the real facts and conditions of the\nneutralisation are taken into consideration. If sovereignty\nis nothing else than supreme authority, a neutralised\nState is as fully Sovereign as any not neutralised\nState. It is entirely independent outside as well as\ninside its borders, since independence does not at all\nmean boundless liberty of action. [155] Nobody maintains\nthat the guaranteed protection of the independence and\nintegrity of the neutralised State places this State under\nthe protectorate or any other kind of authority of the [Pg 150] guarantors. And the condition of the neutralisation\nto abstain from war, treaties of alliance, and the like,\ncontains restrictions which do in no way destroy the\nfull sovereignty of the neutralised State. Such condition\nhas the consequence only that the neutralised\nState exposes itself to an intervention by right, and\nloses the guaranteed protection in case it commits hostilities\nagainst another State, enters into a treaty of\nalliance, and the like. Just as a not-neutralised State\nwhich has concluded treaties of arbitration with other\nStates to settle all conflicts between one another by\narbitration has not lost part of its sovereignty because\nit has thereby to abstain from arms, so a neutralised\nState has not lost part of its sovereignty through entering\ninto the obligation to abstain from hostilities and\ntreaties of alliance. This becomes quite apparent when\nit is taken into consideration that a neutralised State\nnot only can conclude treaties of all kinds, except\ntreaties of alliance, guarantee, and the like, but can\nalso have an army and navy [156] and can build fortresses,\nas long as this is done with the purpose of preparing\ndefence only. Neutralisation does not even exercise an\ninfluence upon the rank of a State. Belgium, Switzerland,\nand Luxemburg are States with royal honours and\ndo not rank behind Great Britain or any other of the\nguarantors of their neutralisation. Nor is it denied\nthat neutralised States, in spite of their weakness and\ncomparative unimportance, can nevertheless play an\nimportant part within the Family of Nations. Although\nshe has no voice where history is made by the\nsword, Switzerland has exercised great influence with\nregard to several points of progress in International\nLaw. Thus the Geneva Convention owes its existence\nto the initiative of Switzerland. The fact that a permanently [Pg 151] neutralised State is in many questions a\ndisinterested party makes such State fit to take the\ninitiative where action by a Great Power would create\nsuspicion and reservedness on the part of other Powers.",

There should be no doubt that\nthese States are not International Persons of the same\nkind and the same position within the Family of Nations\nas Christian States. But it is equally wrong to maintain\nthat they are absolutely outside the Family of\nNations, and are for no part International Persons.\nSince they send and receive diplomatic envoys and conclude\ninternational treaties, the opinion is justified that\nsuch States are International Persons only in some\nrespects—namely, those in which they have expressly\nor tacitly been received into the Family of Nations.\nWhen Christian States begin such intercourse with these\nnon-Christian States as to send diplomatic envoys to\nthem and receive their diplomatic envoys, and when\nthey enter into treaty obligations with them, they indirectly\ndeclare that they are ready to recognise them\nfor these parts as International Persons and subjects of\nthe Law of Nations. But for other parts such non-Christian\nStates remain as yet outside the circle of the\nFamily of Nations, especially with regard to war, and\nthey are for those parts treated by the Christian Powers\naccording to discretion. This condition of things will, [Pg 156] however, not last very long. It may be expected that\nwith the progress of civilisation these States will become\nsooner or later International Persons in the full sense\nof the term. They are at present in a state of transition,\nand some of them are the subjects of international\narrangements of great political importance. Thus by\nthe Treaty of London of December 13, 1906, Great\nBritain, France, and Italy agree to co-operate in maintaining\nthe independence and integrity of Abyssinia, [170] and the General Act of the Conference of Algeciras of\nApril 7, 1906, [171] signed by Great Britain, Germany,\nAustria-Hungary, Belgium, Spain, the United States\nof America, France, Italy, Holland, Portugal, Russia,\nSweden, and Morocco herself, endeavours to suppress\nanarchy in Morocco and to introduce reforms in its\ninternal administration. This Act, [172] which recognises, on\nthe one hand, the independence and integrity of Morocco,\nand, on the other, equal commercial facilities in that\ncountry for all nations, contains:—(1) A Declaration\nconcerning the organisation of the Moroccan police;\n(2) Regulations concerning the detection and suppression\nof the illicit trade in arms; (3) An Act of concession\nfor a Moorish State Bank; (4) A Declaration concerning\nan improved yield of the taxes and the creation of new\nsources of revenue; (5) Regulations respecting customs\nand the suppression of fraud and smuggling; (6) A\nDeclaration concerning the public services and public\nworks.",

When the Law of Nations began to grow up\namong the States of Christendom, the Pope was the\nmonarch of one of those States—namely, the so-called\nPapal States. This State owed its existence to Pepin-le-Bref\nand his son Charlemagne, who established it in\ngratitude to the Popes Stephen III. and Adrian I., who\ncrowned them as Kings of the Franks. It remained\nin the hands of the Popes till 1798, when it became a\nrepublic for about three years. In 1801 the former\norder of things was re-established, but in 1809 it became\na part of the Napoleonic Empire. In 1814 it was\nre-established, and remained in existence till 1870, when\nit was annexed to the Kingdom of Italy. Throughout\nthe existence of the Papal States, the Popes were\nmonarchs and, as such, equals of all other monarchs.\nTheir position was, however, even then anomalous, as\ntheir influence and the privileges granted to them by\nthe different States were due, not alone to their being\nmonarchs of a State, but to their being the head of\nthe Roman Catholic Church.

When, in 1870, Italy annexed the Papal\nStates and made Rome her capital, she had to undertake\nthe task of creating a position for the Holy See\nand the Pope which was consonant with the importance\nof the latter to the Roman Catholic Church. It seemed\nimpossible that the Pope should become an ordinary\nItalian subject and that the Holy See should be an\ninstitution under the territorial supremacy of Italy.\nFor many reasons no alteration was desirable in the\nadministration by the Holy See of the affairs of the\nRoman Catholic Church or in the position of the Pope\nas the inviolable head of that Church. To meet the case\nthe Italian Parliament passed an Act regarding the\nguaranties granted to the Pope and the Holy See, which\nis commonly called the \"Law of Guaranty.\" According\nto this the position of the Pope and the Holy See is\nin Italy as follows:—",
                                        "The person of the Pope is sacred and inviolable\n(article 1), although he is subjected to the Civil Courts\nof Italy. [173] An offence against his person is to be punished\nin the same way as an offence against the King\nof Italy (article 2). He enjoys all the honours of a\nsovereign, retains the privileges of precedence conceded\nto him by Roman Catholic monarchs, has the right to\nkeep an armed body-guard of the same strength as\nbefore the annexation for the safety of his person and\nof his palaces (article 3), and receives an allowance of\n3,225,000 francs (article 4). The Vatican, the seat of\nthe Holy See, and the palaces where a conclave for the\nelection of a new Pope or where an Oecumenical Council\nmeets, are inviolable, and no Italian official is allowed\nto enter them without consent of the Holy See (articles\n5-8). The Pope is absolutely free in performing all the\nfunctions connected with his mission as head of the\nRoman Catholic Church, and so are his officials (articles [Pg 159] 9 and 10). The Pope has the right to send and to\nreceive envoys, who enjoy all the privileges of the\ndiplomatic envoys sent and received by Italy (article\n11). The freedom of communication between the Pope\nand the entire Roman Catholic world is recognised, and\nthe Pope has therefore the right to a post and telegraph\noffice of his own in the Vatican or any other place of\nresidence and to appoint his own post-office clerks\n(article 12). And, lastly, the colleges and other institutions\nof the Pope for the education of priests in Rome\nand the environments remain under his exclusive supervision,\nwithout any interference on the part of the\nItalian authorities.",

But practically foreign\nStates as well as the Popes themselves, although the\nlatter have never ceased to protest against the condition\nof things created by the annexation of the Papal States,\nhave made use of the provisions [174] of that law. Several\nforeign States send side by side with their diplomatic\nenvoys accredited to Italy special envoys to the Pope,\nand the latter sends envoys to several foreign States.",

The Law of Guaranty is not International\nbut Italian Municipal Law, and the members of the\nFamily of Nations have hitherto not made any special\narrangements with regard to the International position\nof the Holy See and the Pope. And, further, there can\nbe no doubt that since the extinction of the Papal States\nthe Pope is no longer a monarch whose sovereignty is\nderived from his position as the head of a State. For\nthese reasons many writers [175] maintain that the Holy\nSee and the Pope have no longer any international [Pg 160] position whatever according to the Law of Nations,\nsince States only and exclusively are International\nPersons. But if the facts of international life and the\nactual condition of things in every-day practice are\ntaken into consideration, this opinion has no basis to\nstand upon. Although the Holy See is not a State, the\nenvoys sent by her to foreign States are treated by the\nlatter on the same footing with diplomatic envoys as\nregards exterritoriality, inviolability, and ceremonial\nprivileges, and those foreign States which send envoys\nto the Holy See claim for them from Italy all the privileges\nand the position of diplomatic envoys. Further,\nalthough the Pope is no longer the head of a State, the\nprivileges due to the head of a monarchical State are\nstill granted to him by foreign States. Of course,\nthrough this treatment the Holy See does not acquire\nthe character of an International Person, nor does the\nPope thereby acquire the character of a head of a\nmonarchical State. But for some points the Holy See\nis actually treated as though she were an International\nPerson, and the Pope is treated actually in every point\nas though he were the head of a monarchical State. It\nmust therefore be maintained that by custom, by tacit\nconsent of the members of the Family of Nations, the\nHoly See has a quasi international position. This position\nallows her to claim against all the States treatment\non some points as though she were an International\nPerson, and further to claim treatment of the Pope in\nevery point as though he were the head of a monarchical\nState. But it must be emphasised that, although the\nenvoys sent and received by the Holy See must be\ntreated as diplomatic envoys, [176] they are not such in fact, [Pg 161] for they are not agents for international affairs of\nStates, but exclusively agents for the affairs of the\nRoman Catholic Church. And it must further be emphasised\nthat the Holy See cannot conclude international\ntreaties or claim a vote at international congresses\nand conferences. The so-called Concordats—that\nis, treaties between the Holy See and States with\nregard to matters of the Roman Catholic Church—are\nnot international treaties, although analogous treatment\nis usually given to them. Even formerly, when the Pope\nwas the head of a State, such Concordats were not concluded\nwith the Papal States, but with the Holy See and\nthe Pope as representatives of the Roman Catholic\nChurch.",

Diplomatic relations\nbetween France and the Holy See had come to an end in 1905 by France\nrecalling her envoy at the Vatican and at the same time sending the\npassports to Lorenzelli, the Papal Nuncio in Paris. Montagnini, who\nremained at the nunciature in Paris, did not possess any diplomatic\ncharacter after the departure of the Nuncio. Neither his arrest and his\nexpulsion in December 1906, nor the seizure of his papers at the\nnunciature amounted therefore to an international delinquency on the\npart of the French Government. The papers left by the former Papal\nNuncio Lorenzelli were not touched and remained in the archives of the\nformer nunciature until the Austrian ambassador in Paris, in February\n1907, asked the French Foreign Office to transfer them to him for the\npurpose of handing them on to the Holy See. It must be specially\nmentioned that the seizure of his papers and the arrest and expulsion of\nMontagnini took place because he conspired against the French Government\nby encouraging the clergy to refuse obedience to French laws. And it\nmust further be mentioned that Lorenzelli, when he left the nunciature,\ndid not, contrary to all precedent, place the archives of the nunciature\nunder seals and confide them to the protection of another diplomatic\nenvoy in Paris.

Until the last two decades of the nineteenth\ncentury all jurists agreed that the membership of the\nFamily of Nations includes so-called fundamental rights\nfor States. Such rights are chiefly enumerated as the\nright of existence, of self-preservation, of equality, of\nindependence, of territorial supremacy, of holding and\nacquiring territory, of intercourse, and of good name\nand reputation. It was and is maintained that these\nfundamental rights are a matter of course and self-evident,\nsince the Family of Nations consists of Sovereign\nStates. But no unanimity exists with regard to\nthe number, the names, and the contents of these\nalleged fundamental rights. A great confusion exists\nin this matter, and hardly two text-book writers agree\nin details with regard to it. This condition of things\nhas led to a searching criticism of the whole matter, [Pg 166] and several writers [177] have in consequence thereof asked\nthat the fundamental rights of States should totally\ndisappear from the treatises on the Law of Nations. I\ncertainly agree with this. Yet it must be taken into\nconsideration that under the wrong heading of fundamental\nrights a good many correct statements have\nbeen made for hundreds of years, and that numerous\nreal rights and duties are customarily recognised which\nare derived from the very membership of the Family\nof Nations. They are rights and duties which do not\nrise from international treaties between a multitude of\nStates, but which the States customarily hold as International\nPersons, and which they grant and receive\nreciprocally as members of the Family of Nations.\nThey are rights and duties connected with the position\nof the States within the Family of Nations, and it is\ntherefore only adequate to their importance to discuss\nthem in a special chapter under that heading.",

International Personality is the term which\ncharacterises fitly the position of the States within the\nFamily of Nations, since a State acquires International\nPersonality through its recognition as a member. What\nit really means can be ascertained by going back to the\nbasis [178] of the Law of Nations. Such basis is the common\nconsent of the States that a body of legal rules\nshall regulate their intercourse with one another. Now\na legally regulated intercourse between Sovereign States\nis only possible under the condition that a certain\nliberty of action is granted to every State, and that,\non the other hand, every State consents to a certain restriction [Pg 167] of action in the interest of the liberty of action\ngranted to every other State. A State that enters into\nthe Family of Nations retains the natural liberty of\naction due to it in consequence of its sovereignty, but\nat the same time takes over the obligation to exercise\nself-restraint and to restrict its liberty of action in the\ninterest of that of other States. In entering into the\nFamily of Nations a State comes as an equal to equals [179] ;\nit demands that certain consideration be paid to its\ndignity, the retention of its independence, of its territorial\nand its personal supremacy. Recognition of a\nState as a member of the Family of Nations contains\nrecognition of such State's equality, dignity, independence,\nand territorial and personal supremacy. But\nthe recognised State recognises in turn the same qualities\nin other members of that family, and thereby it undertakes\nresponsibility for violations committed by it.\nAll these qualities constitute as a body the International\nPersonality of a State, and International Personality\nmay therefore be said to be the fact, given by the very\nmembership of the Family of Nations, that equality,\ndignity, independence, territorial and personal supremacy,\nand the responsibility of every State are recognised\nby every other State. The States are International\nPersons because they recognise these qualities in one\nanother and recognise their responsibility for violations\nof these qualities.",

But if an intervention takes\nplace by right, it never contains such a violation, because\nthe right of intervention is always based on a\nlegal restriction upon the independence or territorial or\npersonal supremacy of the State concerned, and because [Pg 190] the latter is in duty bound to submit to the intervention.\nNow a State may have a right of intervention against\nanother State, mainly for six reasons: [214]",

The events of 1878 provide an\nillustrative example. Russia had concluded the preliminary\nPeace of San Stefano with defeated Turkey;\nGreat Britain protested because the conditions of this\npeace were inconsistent with the Treaty of Paris of 1856\nand the Convention of London of 1871, and Russia\nagreed to the meeting of the Congress of Berlin for the\npurpose of arranging matters.

Most of the interventions exercised in the\ninterest of the preservation of the Turkish Empire must,\nin so far as they are not based on treaty rights, be\nclassified as interventions in the interest of balance of\npower.

Since, thirdly, the question\nof balance of power is so complicated and the historical\ndevelopment of the States involves gradually an\nalteration of the division of power between the States,\nit must likewise be left to the appreciation of every\nState whether or not it considers the balance of power\nendangered and, therefore, an intervention necessary.\nAnd who can undertake to lay down a hard-and-fast rule\nwith regard to the amount of inhumanity on the part\nof a Government that would justify intervention according\nto the Law of Nations?",

Too\nmany interests are common to all the members of the [Pg 196] Family of Nations, and too great is the natural jealousy\nbetween the Great Powers, for an abuse of intervention\non the part of one powerful State without calling other\nStates into the field. Since unjustified intervention\nviolates the very principles of the Law of Nations, and\nsince, as I have stated above (§ 135) , in case of a violation\nof these principles on the part of a State every\nother State has a right to intervene, any unjustifiable\nintervention by one State in the affairs of another gives\na right of intervention to all other States.

But if the real\nfacts of international life are taken into consideration,\nit becomes at once apparent that such a fundamental\nright of intercourse does not exist. All the consequences\nwhich are said to follow from the right of\nintercourse are not at all consequences of a right,\nbut nothing else than consequences of the fact that\nintercourse between the States is a condition without\nwhich a Law of Nations would not and could not exist.\nThe civilised States make a community of States because [Pg 200] they are knit together through their common interests\nand the manifold intercourse which serves these interests.\nThrough intercourse with one another and\nwith the growth of their common interests the Law of\nNations has grown up among the civilised States.\nWhere there is no intercourse there cannot be a community\nand a law for such community. A State cannot\nbe a member of the Family of Nations and an International\nPerson, if it has no intercourse whatever with\nat least one or more other States. Varied intercourse\nwith other States is a necessity for every civilised\nState. The mere fact that a State is a member of the\nFamily of Nations shows that it has various intercourse\nwith other States, for otherwise it would never\nhave become a member of that family. Intercourse is\ntherefore one of the characteristics of the position of\nthe States within the Family of Nations, and it may be\nmaintained that intercourse is a presupposition of the\ninternational Personality of every State. But no special\nright or rights of intercourse between the States exist\naccording to the Law of Nations. It is because such\nspecial rights of intercourse do not exist that the States\nconclude special treaties regarding matters of post,\ntelegraphs, telephones, railways, and commerce. On\nthe other hand, most States keep up protective duties\nto exclude or hamper foreign trade in the interest of\ntheir home commerce, industry, and agriculture. And\nalthough as a rule they allow [225] aliens to travel and\nto reside on their territory, they can expel every foreign\nsubject according to discretion.",

[241] States which claim jurisdiction\nof this kind threaten punishment for certain acts either\nagainst the State itself, such as high treason, forging\nbank-notes, and the like, or against its citizens, such as\nmurder or arson, libel and slander, and the like. These\nStates cannot, of course, exercise this jurisdiction as\nlong as the foreigner concerned remains outside their\nterritory. But if, after the committal of such act, he\nenters their territory and comes thereby under their\nterritorial supremacy, they have an opportunity of\ninflicting punishment. The question is, therefore,\nwhether States have a right to jurisdiction over acts of\nforeigners committed in foreign countries, and whether\nthe home State of such an alien has a duty to acquiesce\nin the latter's punishment in case he comes into\nthe power of these States. The question must be answered\nin the negative. For at the time such criminal\nacts are committed the perpetrators are neither under\nthe territorial nor under the personal supremacy of the\nStates concerned. And a State can only require respect\nfor its laws from such aliens as are permanently or\ntransiently within its territory. No right for a State\nto extend its jurisdiction over acts of foreigners committed\nin foreign countries can be said to have grown\nup according to the Law of Nations, and the right of\nprotection over citizens abroad held by every State\nwould justify it in an intervention in case one of its\ncitizens abroad should be required to stand his trial\nbefore the Courts of another State for criminal acts\nwhich he did not commit during the time he was under\nthe territorial supremacy of such State. [242] In the [Pg 205] only [243] case which is reported—namely, in the case of\nCutting—an intervention took place according to this\nview. In 1886, one A. K. Cutting, a subject of the United\nStates, was arrested in Mexico for an alleged libel against\none Emigdio Medina, a subject of Mexico, which was\npublished in the newspaper of El Paso in Texas. Mexico\nmaintained that she had a right to punish Cutting,\nbecause according to her Criminal Law offences committed\nby foreigners abroad against Mexican subjects\nare punishable in Mexico. The United States, however,\nintervened, [244] and demanded Cutting's release. Mexico\nrefused to comply with this demand, but nevertheless\nCutting was finally released, as the plaintiff withdrew his\naction for libel. Since Mexico likewise refused to comply\nwith the demand of the United States to alter her\nCriminal Law for the purpose of avoiding in the future\na similar incident, diplomatic practice has not at all\nsettled the subject.",

This is only correct with reference to certain\nacts of a State towards its subjects. Since a State\ncan abolish parts of its Municipal Law and can make\nnew Municipal Law, it can always avoid legal, although\nnot moral, responsibility by a change of Municipal Law.\nDifferent from this internal autocracy is the external\nresponsibility of a State to fulfil its international legal\nduties. Responsibility for such duties is, as will be remembered, [245] a quality of every State as an International\nPerson, without which the Family of Nations could not\npeaceably exist. Although there is no International [Pg 207] Court of Justice which could establish such responsibility\nand pronounce a fine or other punishment against\na State for neglect of its international duties, State\nresponsibility concerning international duties is nevertheless\na legal responsibility. For a State cannot\nabolish or create new International Law in the same\nway as it can abolish or create new Municipal Law. A\nState, therefore, cannot renounce its international duties\nunilaterally [246] at discretion, but is and remains legally\nbound by them. And although there is not and never\nwill be a central authority above the single States to\nenforce the fulfilment of these duties, there is the legalised\nself-help of the single States against one another.\nFor every neglect of an international legal duty constitutes\nan international delinquency, [247] and the violated\nState can through reprisals or even war compel the\ndelinquent State to comply with its international duties.\nIt is only theorists who deny the possibility of a legal\nresponsibility of States, the practice of the States\nthemselves recognises it distinctly, although there may\nin a special case be controversy as to whether a responsibility\nis to be borne. And State responsibility\nis now in a general way recognised for the time of war\nby article 3 of the Hague Convention of 1907, concerning\nthe Laws and Customs of War on Land, which\nstipulates: \"A belligerent party which violates the\nprovisions of the said Regulations shall, if the case\ndemands, be liable to make compensation.

I name as \"original\" the responsibility\nborne by a State for its own—that is, its\nGovernment's actions, and for such actions of the lower\nagents or private individuals as are performed at the\nGovernment's command or with its authorisation. But\nStates have to bear another responsibility besides that\njust mentioned.

Since the\nLaw of Nations is a law between States only, and since\nStates are the sole exclusive subjects of International\nLaw, individuals are mere objects [248] of International Law,\nand the latter is unable to confer directly rights and\nduties upon individuals.

This distinction has, [Pg 230] however, in former centuries not been sharply drawn. [270] In spite of the dictum of Seneca, \"Omnia rex imperio\npossidet, singuli dominio,\" the imperium of the monarch\nand the State over the State territory has very\noften been identified with private property of the\nmonarch or the State. But with the disappearance of\nabsolutism this identification has likewise disappeared.\nIt is for this reason that nowadays, according to the\nConstitutional Law of most countries, neither the monarch\nnor the Government is able to dispose of parts of\nthe State territory at will and without the consent of\nParliament.

Thus Schleswig-Holstein\nand Lauenburg from 1864 till 1866 were under the condominium of Austria and Prussia.

                                        "(2) The second case is that of the administration of [Pg 233] a piece of territory by a foreign Power, with the consent\nof the owner-State. Thus, since 1878 the Turkish\nisland of Cyprus has been under British administration,\nand the then Turkish provinces of Bosnia and Herzegovina\nwere from 1878 to 1908 under the administration\nof Austria-Hungary. In these cases a cession of\npieces of territory has for all practical purposes taken\nplace, although in law the respective pieces still belong\nto the former owner-State. Anyhow, it is certain that\nonly one sovereignty is exercised over these pieces—namely,\nthe sovereignty of the State which exercises\nadministration. On the other hand, however, the fact\nthat in these cases pieces of territory have for all practical\npurposes been ceded to another State does not\nempower the latter arbitrarily to annex the territory\nwithout the consent of the State owning it in law.\nAustria-Hungary had therefore no right to annex, in\n1908, without the previous consent of Turkey, the\nprovinces of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

[279] Thus, further, in 1803 Sweden pledged the\ntown of Wismar [280] to the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin,\nand the Republic of Genoa in 1768 pledged\nthe island of Corsica to France. All such cases comprise,\nfor all practical purposes, cessions of pieces of\nterritory, but in strict law they remain the property\nof the leasing State. And such property is not a mere [Pg 234] fiction, as some writers [281] maintain, for it is possible that\nthe lease comes to an end by expiration of time or by\nrescission. Thus the lease, granted in 1894 by Great\nBritain to the former Congo Free State, of the so-called\nLado Enclave, was rescinded [282] in 1906. However this\nmay be, as long as the lease has not expired it is the\nlease-holder who exercises sovereignty over the territory\nconcerned.",

In\nthis way [283] the Republic of Panama transferred, in 1903,\nto the United States of America a ten-mile wide strip\nof territory for the purpose of constructing, administrating,\nand defending the so-called Panama Canal. In\nthis case the grantor retains only in name the property\nof the territory, the transfer of the land concerned is\nreally cession all but in name, and it is certain that\nonly the grantee exercises sovereignty there.",

As a Federal State is considered [284] a State of\nits own side by side with its single member-States, the\nfact is apparent that the different territories of the\nsingle member-States are at the same time collectively\nthe territory of the Federal State.

An international conference for\nthe purpose of agreeing upon an international convention\nconcerning aviation met in 1910 at Paris, but did\nnot produce any result. The fact is that, since aviation\nis still in its infancy, practical experience is lacking\nconcerning many questions which can only be settled\nwhen aviation has been more developed. It is tempting\nto apply the rules concerning the maritime belt and\nthe Open Sea analogously to the space of the atmosphere,\nand, therefore, to distinguish between a zone\nof a certain height, in which the territorial State can\nexercise sovereignty, and, on the other hand, the atmosphere\nbeyond that height, which is to be considered\nfree like the Open Sea. This comparison between the\natmosphere and the sea is, however, faulty for two\nreasons. Firstly, the Open Sea is an international highway\nthat connects distant lands between which, except\nby sea, no communication would be possible, whereas\nthe atmosphere is not such an indispensable highway.\nSecondly, navigation on the Open Sea comprises no\ndanger whatever to the security of the different States\nand the lives and property of their inhabitants, whereas\naviation threatens such danger to a great extent. The\nchief question at issue is, therefore, whether the territorial\nState should or should not be considered to [Pg 238] exercise sovereignty over the space of the atmosphere\nto an unbounded height, and to have the power to\nprevent the passage of foreign aviators altogether, or to\nenact stringent rules with which they have to comply.\nIt would probably be best for the States in conference\nto adopt such rules concerning the whole space of the\natmosphere as are similar to those valid by customary\nInternational Law for the maritime belt, that is:—to\nrecognise, on the one hand, sovereignty of the territorial\nState over the space of its atmosphere, but, on the other\nhand, to give a right to foreign States to demand from\nthe territorial State that foreign private—but not\npublic!—air-vessels may pass through its atmosphere,\nprovided they comply with the rules enacted by the\nterritorial State for the aerial traffic.

Article 11\nof the Peace Treaty of Paris, [316] 1856, neutralised the\nBlack Sea, declared it open to merchantmen of all\nnations, but interdicted it to men-of-war of the littoral\nas well as of other States, admitting only a few Turkish\nand Russian public vessels for the service of their coasts.\nBut although the neutralisation was stipulated \"formally\nand in perpetuity,\" it lasted only till 1870. In\nthat year, during the Franco-German War, Russia shook\noff the restrictions of the Treaty of Paris, and the Powers\nassembled at the Conference of London signed on\nMarch 13, 1871, the Treaty of London, [317] by which the\nneutralisation of the Black Sea and the exclusion of [Pg 248] men-of-war therefrom were abolished.

In the North Atlantic Coast Fisheries case, between the United\nStates and Great Britain, which was decided by the Permanent Court of\nArbitration at the Hague in 1910, the United States—see the official\npublication of the case, p. 136—also contended that only such bays\ncould be considered territorial as possessed an entrance not wider than\nsix miles, but the Court refused to agree to this contention.]",

But the practice of other countries, [Pg 263] approved by many writers, goes beyond this limit.\nThus Great Britain holds the Bay of Conception in\nNewfoundland to be territorial, although it goes forty\nmiles into the land and has an entrance more than\ntwenty miles wide. And the United States claim the\nChesapeake and Delaware Bays, as well as other inlets\nof the same character, as territorial, [347] although many\nEuropean writers oppose this claim.

It is hardly to be expected\nthat this opinion of the Court will induce theory\nand practice to drop the conception of State servitudes,\nwhich is of great value because it fitly covers those\nrestrictions on the territorial supremacy of the State\nby which a part or the whole of its territory is in a\nlimited way made perpetually to serve a certain purpose\nor interest of another State. That the doctrine of\nState servitudes originated in the peculiar conditions of\nthe Holy Roman Empire does not make it unfit for the\nconditions of modern life if its practical value can be\ndemonstrated. Further, the assertion that the doctrine\nis but little suited to the principle of sovereignty which\nprevails in States under a constitutional government,\nand has, therefore, found little, if any, support from\nmodern publicists, does not agree with the facts.\nLastly, the statement that a servitude in International\nLaw predicated an express grant of a sovereign right,\nis not based on any other authority than the contention\nof the United States, which made this unfounded\nstatement in presenting their case before the Tribunal.\nThe fact is that a State servitude, although to a certain\ndegree it restricts the sovereignty (territorial supremacy)\nof the State concerned, does as little as any\nother restriction upon the sovereignty of a State confer\na sovereign right upon the State in favour of which\nit is established.",

No unanimity exists among writers on the\nLaw of Nations with regard to the modes of acquiring\nterritory on the part of the members of the Family of\nNations. The topic owes its controversial character to [Pg 283] the fact that the conception of State territory has undergone\na great change since the appearance of the science\nof the Law of Nations. When Grotius created that\nscience, State territory used to be still, as in the Middle\nAges, more or less identified with the private property\nof the monarch of the State. Grotius and his followers\napplied, therefore, the rules of Roman Law concerning\nthe acquisition of private property to the acquisition of\nterritory by States. [401] As nowadays, as far as International\nLaw is concerned, every analogy to private\nproperty has disappeared from the conception of State\nterritory, the acquisition of territory by a State can\nmean nothing else than the acquisition of sovereignty over such territory. It is obvious that under these\ncircumstances the rules of Roman Law concerning the\nacquisition of private property can no longer be applied.\nYet the fact that they have been applied in the past\nhas left traces which can hardly be obliterated; and\nthey need not be obliterated, since they contain a good\ndeal of truth in agreement with the actual facts. But\nthe different modes of acquiring territory must be\ntaken from the real practice of the States, and not from\nRoman Law, although the latter's terminology and\ncommon-sense basis may be made use of.",

If the historical facts are taken into consideration,\ndifferent reasons may be found to account\nfor the exercise of sovereignty by a State over the\ndifferent sections of its territory. One section may\nhave been ceded by another State, another section may\nhave come into the possession of the owner in consequence\nof accretion, a third through subjugation, a [Pg 284] fourth through occupation of no State's land. As regards\na fifth section, a State may say that it has exercised\nits sovereignty over the same for so long a period\nthat the fact of having had it in undisturbed possession\nis a sufficient title of ownership. Accordingly, five\nmodes of acquiring territory may be distinguished,\nnamely: cession, occupation, accretion, subjugation,\nand prescription. Most writers recognise these five\nmodes. Some, however, do not recognise prescription;\nsome assert that accretion creates nothing else than a\nmodification of the territory of a State; and some do\nnot recognise subjugation at all, or declare it to be only\na special case of occupation. It is for these reasons that\nsome writers recognise only two or three [402] modes of\nacquiring territory.

In practice, however, the interested States\nhave neither in the past nor in the present acted in\nconformity with such a rule; on the contrary, they\nhave always tried to attribute to their occupation a\nmuch wider area.

[439] Again, it has been maintained that, when\na coast line has been effectively occupied, the extent\nof the occupation reaches up to the watershed of all\nsuch rivers as empty into the coast line.

[441] But all these and other fanciful assertions\nhave no basis to rest upon. In truth, no general\nrule can be laid down beyond the above, that occupation\nreaches as far as it is effective. How far it is\neffective is a question of the special case. It is obvious [Pg 296] that when the agent of a State takes possession of a\nterritory and makes a settlement on a certain spot of\nit, he intends thereby to acquire a vast area by his\noccupation. Everything depends, therefore, upon the\nfact how far around the settlement or settlements the\nestablished responsible authority that governs the territory\nin the name of the possessor succeeds in gradually\nextending the established sovereignty. The payment\nof a tribute on the part of tribes settled far away, the\nfact that flying columns of the military or the police\nsweep, when necessary, remote spots, and many other\nfacts, can show how far round the settlements the\npossessor is really able to assert the established authority.\nBut it will always be difficult to mark exactly in this\nway the boundary of an effective occupation, since\nnaturally the tendency prevails to extend the sway\nconstantly and gradually over a wider area.

Some\nwriters maintain that these individuals do in spite of\ntheir absence become subjects of the subjugator, others\nemphatically deny it. Whereas the practice of the\nUnited States of America seems to be in conformity\nwith the latter opinion, [463] the practice of Prussia in 1866\nwas in conformity with the former. Thus in the case\nof Count Platen-Hallermund, a Cabinet Minister of\nKing George V. of Hanover, who left Hanover with his\nKing before the annexation in 1866 and was in 1868\nprosecuted for high treason before the Supreme Prussian\nCourt at Berlin, this Court decided that the accused had\nbecome a Prussian subject through the annexation of\nHanover. [464] I believe that a distinction must be made\nbetween those individuals who leave the country before and those who leave it after annexation. The former\nare not under the sway of the subjugator at the time\nof annexation, and, since the personal supremacy of\ntheir home State terminates with the latter's extinction\nthrough annexation, they would seem to be outside the\nsovereignty of the subjugator. But those individuals\nwho leave the country after annexation leave it at a [Pg 307] time when they have become subjects of the new Sovereign,\nand they therefore remain such subjects even\nafter they have left the country, for there is no rule of\nthe Law of Nations in existence which obliges a subjugator\nto grant the privilege of emigration [465] to the\ninhabitants of the conquered territory.",

From the conception of prescription, as above\ndefined, it becomes apparent that no general rule can\nbe laid down as regards the length of time and other\ncircumstances which are necessary to create a title by\nprescription. Everything depends upon the merits of\nthe individual case. As long as other Powers keep up\nprotests and claims, the actual exercise of sovereignty\nis not undisturbed, nor is there the required general\nconviction that the present condition of things is in\nconformity with international order. But after such [Pg 310] protests and claims, if any, cease to be repeated, the\nactual possession ceases to be disturbed, and thus under\ncertain circumstances matters may gradually ripen into\nthat condition which is in conformity with international\norder. The question, at what time and under what\ncircumstances such a condition of things arises, is not\none of law but of fact. The question, for instance,\nwhether, although the three partitions of Poland were\nwrongful and unlawful acts, Prussia, Austria, and\nRussia have now a good title by prescription to hold\nterritories which were formerly Polish must, I doubt\nnot, be answered in the affirmative. For all the members\nof the Family of Nations have now silently acquiesced\nin the present condition of things, although as\nlate as 1846 Great Britain and France protested against\nthe annexation of the Republic of Cracow on the part of\nAustria. In spite of the fact that the Polish nation\nhas not yet given up its hope of seeing a Polish\nState re-established on the former Polish territory, the\ngeneral conviction among the members of the Family\nof Nations is that the present condition of things is\nin conformity with international order. When, to give\nanother example, a State which originally held an island mala fide under the title by occupation, knowing well\nthat this land had already been occupied by another\nState, has succeeded in keeping up its possession undisturbed\nfor so long a time that the former possessor\nhas ceased to protest and has silently dropped the\nclaim, the conviction will be prevalent among the members\nof the Family of Nations that the present condition\nof things is in conformity with international order.\nThese examples show why a certain number of years [472] cannot, [Pg 311] once for all, be fixed to create the title by prescription.\nThere are indeed immeasurable and imponderable\ncircumstances and influences besides the\nmere run of time [473] at work to create the conviction on\nthe part of the members of the Family of Nations that\nin the interest of stability of order the present possessor\nshould be considered the rightful owner of a territory.\nAnd these circumstances and influences, which are of\na political and historical character, differ so much in\nthe different cases that the length of time necessary\nfor prescription must likewise differ.",

Actual\nabandonment alone does not involve dereliction as long\nas it must be presumed that the owner has the will and\nability to retake possession of the territory.

The cases\nof the island of Santa Lucia and of the Delagoa Bay\nmay be quoted as illustrations:—",

In 1664 an English force under\nLord Willoughby attacked the French, drove them into\nthe mountains, and held the island until 1667, when\nthe English withdrew and the French returned from\nthe mountains. No further step was made by England\nto retake the island, but she nevertheless asserted for\nmany years to come that she had not abandoned it sine spe redeundi , and that, therefore, France in 1650\nhad no right to consider it no man's land. Finally,\nhowever, England resigned her claims by the Peace\nTreaty of Paris of 1763. [478]",

The dispute was not\nsettled until 1875, when the case was submitted to\nthe arbitration of the President of France.

Since no Law of Nations\nin the modern sense of the term existed during antiquity\nand the greater part of the Middle Ages, no importance\nis to be attached to the pronouncement of\nAntoninus Pius, Roman Emperor from 138 to 161:—\"Being [482] the Emperor of the world, I am consequently\nthe law of the sea.\" Nor is it of importance that the\nEmperors of the old German Empire, who were considered\nto be the successors of the Roman Emperors,\nstyled themselves among other titles \"King of the [Pg 316] Ocean.\" Real claims to sovereignty over parts of the\nOpen Sea begin, however, to be made in the second\nhalf of the Middle Ages. And there is no doubt whatever\nthat at the time when the modern Law of Nations\ngradually rose it was the conviction of the States that\nthey could extend their sovereignty over certain parts\nof the Open Sea. Thus, the Republic of Venice was\nrecognised as the Sovereign over the Adriatic Sea, and\nthe Republic of Genoa as the Sovereign of the Ligurian\nSea. Portugal claimed sovereignty over the whole of\nthe Indian Ocean and of the Atlantic south of Morocco,\nSpain over the Pacific and the Gulf of Mexico, both\nPortugal and Spain basing their claims on two Papal\nBulls promulgated by Alexander VI. in 1493, which\ndivided the new world between these Powers.

Twenty-nine years after her answer to\nMendoza, in 1609, appeared Grotius's short treatise [488] \"Mare liberum.\" The intention of Grotius was to\nshow that the Dutch had a right of navigation and\ncommerce with the Indies in spite of the Portuguese\ninterdictions. He contends that the sea cannot be\nState property, because it cannot really be taken into\npossession through occupation, [489] and that consequently\nthe sea is by nature free from the sovereignty of any\nState.

Since no State can exercise protection over\nvessels that do not sail under its flag, and since every\nvessel must, in the interest of the order and safety of\nthe Open Sea, sail under the flag of a State, the question\nhas been raised whether not only maritime States\nbut also such States as are not littoral States of the\nSea have a claim to a maritime flag.

At present\nno non-littoral State actually has a maritime flag, and [Pg 327] all vessels belonging to subjects of such non-littoral\nStates sail under the flag of a maritime State. But\nany day might bring a change. The question as to the\nclaim to a maritime flag on the part of a non-littoral\nState was discussed in Switzerland. When, in 1864,\nSwiss merchants in Trieste, Smyrna, Hamburg, and\nSt. Petersburg applied to the Swiss Bundesrath for permission\nto have their vessels sailing under the Swiss\nflag, the Bundesrath was ready to comply with the\nrequest, but the Swiss Parliament, the Bundesversammlung,\nrefused the necessary consent. In 1889 and 1891\nnew applications of the same kind were made, but\nSwitzerland again refused to have a maritime flag. [509] She had no doubt that she had a claim to such flag, but\nwas aware of the difficulties arising from the fact that,\nhaving no seaports of her own, vessels sailing under\nher flag would in many points have to depend upon\nthe goodwill of the maritime Powers.

They maintain, first, that a part of [Pg 328] the Open Sea could not effectively be occupied by a\nNavy and could therefore not be brought under the\nactual sway of any State. And they assert, secondly,\nthat Nature does not give a right to anybody to appropriate\nsuch things as may inoffensively be used by\neverybody and are inexhaustible, and, therefore, sufficient\nfor all. [513] The last argument has nowadays hardly\nany value, especially for those who have freed themselves\nfrom the fanciful rules of the so-called Law of\nNature. And the first argument is now without basis\nin face of the development of the modern navies, since\nthe number of public vessels which the different States\npossess at present would enable many a State to occupy\neffectively one part or another of the Open Sea. The\nreal reason for the freedom of the Open Sea is represented\nin the motive which led to the attack against\nmaritime sovereignty, and in the purpose for which\nsuch attack was made—namely, the freedom of communication,\nand especially commerce, between the\nStates which are severed by the Sea.

Thus, secondly, if unauthorised\nacts of violence, such as murder of persons on board the\nattacked vessel or destruction of goods thereon, are\ncommitted on the Open Sea without intent to plunder,\nsuch acts are practically considered to be piratical.\nUnder these circumstances several writers, [550] correctly,\nI think, oppose the usual definition of piracy as an act\nof violence committed by a private vessel against another\nwith intent to plunder. But no unanimity exists\namong these very writers concerning a fit definition of\npiracy, and the matter is therefore very controversial.\nIf a definition is desired which really covers all such [Pg 341] acts as are practically treated as piratical, piracy must\nbe defined as every unauthorised act of violence against\npersons or goods committed on the Open Sea either by a\nprivate vessel against another vessel or by the mutinous\ncrew or passengers against their own vessel .

A case of a particular kind would seem to be the pearl fishery off\nCeylon, which extends to a distance of twenty miles from the shore and\nfor which regulations exist which are enforced against foreign as well\nas British subjects.

When carried on under State\nprotection, as that off the British island of Ceylon, or that in the\nPersian Gulf which is protected by British ships in pursuance of\ntreaties with certain chiefs of the Arabian mainland, it may be regarded\nas an occupation of the bed of the sea. In that character the pearl\nfishery will be territorial even though the shallowness of the water may\nallow it to be practised beyond the limit which the State in question\ngenerally fixes for the littoral seas, as in the case of Ceylon it is\npractised beyond the three miles limit generally recognised by Great\nBritain. 'Qui doutera,' says Vattel (I. § 28), 'que les pêcheries de\nBahrein et de Ceylon ne puissent légitimement tomber en propriété?' And\nthe territorial nature of the industry will carry with it, as being\nnecessary for its protection, the territorial character of the spot.\"\nThis opinion of Westlake coincides with that contended by Great Britain\nduring the Behring Sea Arbitration; see Parliamentary Papers, United\nStates, No. 4 (1893) Behring Sea Arbitration, Archives of His Majesty's\nGovernment, pp. 51 and 59. But it is submitted that the bed of the Open\nSea is not a possible object of occupation. The explanation of the pearl\nfisheries off Ceylon and in the Persian Gulf being exclusively British\nis to be found in the fact that the freedom of the Open Sea was not a\nrule of International Law when these fisheries were taken possession of.\nSee Oppenheim in Z.V.

The subsoil beneath the bed of the Open Sea\nrequires special consideration on account of coal or\nother mines, tunnels, and the like, for the question is\nwhether such buildings can be driven into that subsoil\nat all, and, if this can be done, whether they can be\nunder the territorial supremacy of a particular State.\nThe answer depends entirely upon the character in law\nof such subsoil. If the rules concerning the territorial\nsubsoil [591] would have analogously to be applied to the\nsubsoil beneath the bed of the Open Sea, all rules concerning\nthe Open Sea would necessarily have to be\napplied to the subsoil beneath its bed, and no part of\nthis subsoil could ever come under the territorial supremacy\nof any State. It is, however, submitted [592] that it\nwould not be rational to consider the subsoil beneath [Pg 358] the bed of the Open Sea an inseparable appurtenance\nof the latter, such as the subsoil beneath the territorial\nland and water is. The rationale of the Open Sea\nbeing free and for ever excluded from occupation on the\npart of any State is that it is an international highway\nwhich connects distant lands and thereby secures freedom\nof communication, and especially of commerce,\nbetween such States as are separated by the sea. [593] There is no reason whatever for extending this freedom\nof the Open Sea to the subsoil beneath its bed. On the\ncontrary, there are practical reasons—taking into consideration\nthe building of mines, tunnels, and the like—which\ncompel the recognition of the fact that this\nsubsoil can be acquired through occupation. The following\nfive rules recommend themselves concerning\nthis subject:—",

                                        "(2) This occupation takes place ipso facto by a tunnel\nor a mine being driven from the shore through the subsoil\nof the maritime belt into the subsoil of the Open Sea.",
                                        "(3) This occupation of the subsoil of the Open Sea can\nbe extended up to the boundary line of the subsoil of\nthe territorial maritime belt of another State, for no\nState has an exclusive claim to occupy such part of\nthe subsoil of the Open Sea as is adjacent to the subsoil\nof its territorial maritime belt.",
                                        "(4) An occupation of the subsoil beneath the bed of\nthe Open Sea for a purpose which would endanger the\nfreedom of the Open Sea is inadmissible.",

                                        "If these five rules are correct, there is nothing in\nthe way of coal and other mines which are being exploited\non the shore of a littoral State being extended\ninto the subsoil beneath the Open Sea up to the boundary\nline of the subsoil beneath the territorial maritime\nbelt of another State. Further, a tunnel which might\nbe built between such two parts of the same State—for\ninstance, between Ireland and Scotland—as are\nseparated by the Open Sea would fall entirely under\nthe territorial supremacy of the State concerned. On\nthe other hand, for a tunnel between two different\nStates separated by the Open Sea special arrangements\nby treaty would have to be made concerning the territorial\nsupremacy over that part of the tunnel which\nruns under the bed of the Open Sea."

Another instructive example [599] is furnished\nby article 5 of the Peace Treaty of Prague, 1866,\nbetween Prussia and Austria, which stipulated that\nthe northern district of Schleswig should be ceded by\nPrussia to Denmark in case the inhabitants should by\na plebiscite vote in favour of such cession.

This is a fact which has its consequences\nover the whole area of International Law.

Such rights are said to\ncomprise the right of existence, the right to protection\nof honour, life, health, liberty, and property, the right\nof practising any religion one likes, the right of emigration,\nand the like. But such rights do not in fact [Pg 368] enjoy any guarantee whatever from the Law of Nations, [607] and they cannot enjoy such guarantee, since the Law\nof Nations is a law between States, and since individuals\ncannot be subjects of this law. But there are certain\nfacts which cannot be denied at the background of this\nerroneous opinion. The Law of Nations is a product\nof Christian civilisation and represents a legal order\nwhich binds States, chiefly Christian, into a community.\nIt is therefore no wonder that ethical ideas which are\nsome of them the basis of, others a development from,\nChristian morals, have a tendency to require the help\nof International Law for their realisation. When the\nPowers stipulated at the Berlin Congress of 1878 that\nthe Balkan States should be recognised only under the\ncondition that they did not impose any religious disabilities\non their subjects, they lent their arm to the\nrealisation of such an idea. Again, when the Powers\nafter the beginning of the nineteenth century agreed\nto several international arrangements in the interest\nof the abolition of the slave trade, [608] they fostered the\nrealisation of another of these ideas. And the innumerable\ntreaties between the different States as regards\nextradition of criminals, commerce, navigation, copyright,\nand the like, are inspired by the idea of affording\nample protection to life, health, and property of individuals.\nLastly, there is no doubt that, should a State\nventure to treat its own subjects or a part thereof with [Pg 369] such cruelty as would stagger humanity, public opinion\nof the rest of the world would call upon the Powers to\nexercise intervention [609] for the purpose of compelling\nsuch State to establish a legal order of things within its\nboundaries sufficient to guarantee to its citizens an\nexistence more adequate to the ideas of modern civilisation.\nHowever, a guarantee of the so-called rights of\nmankind cannot be found in all these and other facts.\nNor do the actual conditions of life to which certain\nclasses of subjects are forcibly submitted within certain\nStates show that the Law of Nations really comprises\nsuch guarantee.

Thus, every child [Pg 385] born in Great Britain of German parents acquires at\nthe same time British and German nationality, for such\nchild is British according to British, and German\naccording to German Municipal Law. Double nationality\ncan likewise be the result of marriage. Thus, a\nVenezuelan woman marrying an Englishman acquires\naccording to British law British nationality, but according\nto Venezuelan law she does not lose her Venezuelan\nnationality.

Thus, an illegitimate child of\na German born in England of an English mother is a\nBritish subject according to British and German law,\nbut if after the birth of the child the father marries the\nmother and remains a resident in England, he thereby\nlegitimates the child according to German law, and\nsuch child acquires thereby German nationality without\nlosing his British nationality, although the mother\ndoes lose her British nationality.

As regards the remedy for\nsuch difficulties, it is comparatively easy to meet those\ncreated by absent nationality. If the number of stateless\nindividuals increases much within a certain State,\nthe latter can require them to apply for naturalisation\nor to leave the country; it can even naturalise them\nby Municipal Law against their will, as no other State\nwill, or has a right to, interfere, and as, further, the\nvery fact of the existence of individuals destitute of\nnationality is a blemish in Municipal as well as in\nInternational Law. Much more difficult is it, however,\nto find, within the limits of the present rules of\nthe Law of Nations, means of redress against conflicts\narising from double nationality. Very grave disputes\nindeed have occasionally occurred between States on\naccount of individuals who were claimed as subjects\nby both sides. Thus, in 1812, a time when England\nstill kept to her old rule that no natural-born English\nsubject could lose his nationality, the United States\nwent to war with England because the latter impressed\nEnglishmen naturalised in America from on board\nAmerican merchantmen, claiming the right to do so,\nas according to her law these men were still English\ncitizens. Thus, further, Prussia frequently had during\nthe sixties of the last century disputes with the United\nStates on account of Prussian individuals who, without\nhaving rendered military service at home, had\nemigrated to America to become there naturalised\nand had afterwards returned to Prussia. [639] Again, during [Pg 389] the time of the revolutionary movements in Ireland\nin the last century before the Naturalisation Act of\n1870 was passed, disputes arose between Great Britain\nand the United States on account of such Irishmen\nas took part in these revolutionary movements after\nhaving become naturalised in the United States. [640] It\nwould seem that the only way in which all the difficulties\narising from double and absent nationality could\nreally be done away with is for all the Powers to agree\nupon an international convention, according to which\nthey undertake the obligation to enact by their Municipal [Pg 390] Law such corresponding rules regarding acquisition\nand loss of nationality as make the very occurrence\nof double and absent nationality impossible.

Koszta was a\nHungarian subject who took part in the revolutionary movement of 1848,\nescaped to the United States, and in July, 1852, made a declaration\nunder oath, before a proper tribunal, of his intention to become\nnaturalised there.

Later on, while at Smyrna,\nhe was seized by Austrian officials and taken on board an Austrian\nman-of-war with the intention of bringing him to Austria, to be there\npunished for his part in the revolution of 1848.

Finally, Austria consented to\nKoszta's being brought back to America.

Many writers [642] maintain that every member\nof the Family of Nations is bound by International\nLaw to admit all aliens into its territory for all lawful\npurposes, although they agree that every State could\nexclude certain classes of aliens. This opinion is generally\nheld by those who assert that there is a fundamental\nright of intercourse between States. It will be\nremembered [643] that no such fundamental right exists,\nbut that intercourse is a characteristic of the position\nof the States within the Family of Nations and therefore\na presupposition of the international personality of\nevery State. A State, therefore, cannot exclude aliens\naltogether from its territory without violating the\nspirit of the Law of Nations and endangering its very\nmembership of the Family of Nations. But no State\nactually does exclude aliens altogether. The question\nis only whether an international legal duty can be said [Pg 391] to exist for every State to admit all unobjectionable\naliens to all parts of its territory. And it is this duty\nwhich must be denied as far as the customary Law of\nNations is concerned. It must be emphasised that,\napart from general conventional arrangements, as, for\ninstance, those concerning navigation on international\nrivers, and apart from special treaties of commerce,\nfriendship, and the like, no State can claim the right\nfor its subjects to enter into and reside on the territory\nof a foreign State. The reception of aliens is a matter\nof discretion, and every State is by reason of its territorial\nsupremacy competent to exclude aliens from the\nwhole or any part of its territory. And it is only by\nan inference of this competence that Great Britain, [644] the\nUnited States of America, and other States have made\nspecial laws according to which paupers and criminals,\nas well as diseased and other objectionable aliens, are\nprevented from entering their territory. Every State\nis and must remain master in its own house, and such\nmastership is of especial importance with regard to the\nadmittance of aliens. Of course, if a State excluded all\nsubjects of one State only, this would constitute an\nunfriendly act, against which retorsion would be admissible;\nbut it cannot be denied that a State is competent\nto do this, although in practice such wholesale\nexclusion will never happen. Hundreds of treaties of\ncommerce and friendship exist between the members\nof the Family of Nations according to which they are\nobliged to receive each other's unobjectionable subjects,\nand thus practically the matter is settled, although\nin strict law every State is competent to exclude\nforeigners from its territory.

Although aliens fall at once under the territorial\nsupremacy of the State they enter, they remain\nnevertheless under the protection of their home State.\nBy a universally recognised customary rule of the Law\nof Nations every State holds a right of protection [651] over its citizens abroad, to which corresponds the duty [Pg 396] of every State to treat foreigners on its territory with a\ncertain consideration which will be discussed below,\n§§ 320 -322. The question here is only when and how\nthis right of protection can be exercised. [652] Now there\nis certainly, as far as the Law of Nations is concerned,\nno duty incumbent upon a State to exercise its protection\nover its citizens abroad. The matter is absolutely\nin the discretion of every State, and no citizen\nabroad has by International Law, although he may have\nit by Municipal Law, a right to demand protection from\nhis home State. Often for political reasons States have\nin certain cases refused the exercise of their right of\nprotection over citizens abroad. Be that as it may,\nevery State can exercise this right when one of its\nsubjects is wronged abroad in his person or property,\neither by the State itself on whose territory such person\nor property is for the time, or by such State's officials\nor citizens without such State's interfering for the\npurpose of making good the wrong done. [653] And this\nright can be realised in several ways. Thus, a State\nwhose subjects are wronged abroad can diplomatically\ninsist upon the wrongdoers being punished according\nto the law of the land and upon damages, if necessary,\nbeing paid to its subjects concerned. It can, secondly,\nexercise retorsion and reprisals for the purpose of making\nthe other State comply with its demands. It can,\nfurther, exercise intervention, and it can even go to\nwar when necessary. And there are other means besides\nthose mentioned. It is, however, quite impossible\nto lay down hard-and-fast rules as regards the [Pg 397] question in which way and how far in every case the\nright of protection ought to be exercised. Everything\ndepends upon the merits of the individual case and\nmust be left to the discretion of the State concerned.\nThe latter will have to take into consideration whether\nthe wronged alien was only travelling through or had\nsettled down in the country, whether his behaviour had\nbeen provocative or not, how far the foreign Government\nidentified itself with the acts of officials or subjects,\nand the like.",

As International\nLaw gives no detailed rules regarding expulsion, everything\nis left to the discretion of the single States and\ndepends upon the merits of the individual case. Theory\nand practice correctly make a distinction between expulsion\nin time of war and in time of peace. A belligerent\nmay consider it convenient to expel all enemy\nsubjects residing or temporarily staying within his\nterritory. And, although such a measure may be very\nhard and cruel, the opinion is general that such expulsion\nis justifiable. [659] As regards expulsion in time of [Pg 401] peace, on the other hand, the opinions of writers as\nwell as of States naturally differ much. Such State\nas expels an alien will hardly admit not having had\na just cause. Some States, as Belgium [660] since 1885,\npossess Municipal Laws determining just causes for the\nexpulsion of aliens, and such States' discretion concerning\nexpulsion is, of course, more or less restricted.\nBut many States do not possess such laws, and are,\ntherefore, entirely at liberty to consider a cause as\njustifying expulsion or not. The Institute of International\nLaw at its meeting at Geneva in 1892 adopted\na body of forty-one articles concerning the admittance\nand expulsion of aliens, and in article 28 thereof enumerated\nnine just causes for expulsion in time of peace. [661] I doubt whether the States will ever come to an agreement\nabout just causes of expulsion. The fact cannot\nbe denied that an alien is more or less a guest in the\nforeign land, and the question under what conditions\nsuch guest makes himself objectionable to his host\ncannot once for all be answered by the establishment\nof a body of rules. So much is certain, that with the\ngradual disappearance of despotic views in the different\nStates, and with the advance of true constitutionalism\nguaranteeing individual liberty and freedom of opinion\nand speech, expulsion of aliens, especially for political\nreasons, will become less frequent. Expulsion will,\nhowever, never totally disappear, because it may well be\njustified. Thus, for example, Prussia after the annexation\nof the formerly Free Town of Frankfort-on-the-Main,\nwas certainly justified in expelling those individuals\nwho, for the purpose of avoiding military service in the\nPrussian Army, had by naturalisation become Swiss\ncitizens without giving up their residence at Frankfort.",

Since, however, modern civilisation categorically\ndemands extradition of criminals as a rule, numerous\ntreaties have been concluded between the several\nStates stipulating the cases in which extradition shall\ntake place. According to these treaties, individuals prosecuted\nfor the more important crimes, political crimes\nexcepted, are actually always surrendered to the prosecuting\nState, if not punished locally. But this solution\nof the problem of extradition is a product of the nineteenth\ncentury only. Before the eighteenth century\nextradition of ordinary criminals hardly ever occurred,\nalthough many States used then frequently to surrender\nto each other political fugitives, heretics, and even emigrants,\neither in consequence of special treaties stipulating\nthe surrender of such individuals, or voluntarily\nwithout such treaties. Matters began to undergo a\nchange in the eighteenth century, for then treaties\nbetween neighbouring States frequently stipulated extradition\nof ordinary criminals besides that of political\nfugitives, conspirators, military deserters, and the like. [Pg 405] Vattel (II. § 76) is able to assert in 1758 that murderers,\nincendiaries, and thieves are regularly surrendered by\nneighbouring States to each other. But general treaties\nof extradition between all the members of the Family\nof Nations did not exist in the eighteenth century, and\nthere was hardly a necessity for such general treaties,\nsince traffic was not so developed as nowadays and\nfugitive criminals seldom succeeded in reaching a foreign\nterritory beyond that of a neighbouring State. When,\nhowever, in the nineteenth century, with the appearance\nof railways and Transatlantic steamships, transit\nbegan to develop immensely, criminals used the opportunity\nto flee to distant foreign countries. It was then\nand thereby that the conviction was forced upon the\nStates of civilised humanity that it was in their common\ninterest to surrender ordinary criminals regularly\nto each other. General treaties of extradition became,\ntherefore, a necessity, and the several States succeeded\nin concluding such treaties with each other. There is\nno civilised State in existence nowadays which has not\nconcluded such treaties with the majority of the other\ncivilised States. And the consequence is that, although\nno universal rule of International Law commands it,\nextradition of criminals between States is an established\nfact based on treaties. The present condition of\naffairs is, however, very unsatisfactory, since there are\nmany hundreds of treaties in existence which do not\nat all agree in their details. What is required nowadays,\nand what will certainly be realised in the near future,\nis a universal treaty of extradition, one single treaty\nto which all the civilised States become parties. [668]",

Some States, however, were unwilling to depend [Pg 406] entirely upon the discretion of their Governments\nas regards the conclusion of extradition treaties and\nthe procedure in extradition cases. They have therefore\nenacted special Municipal Laws which enumerate\nthose crimes for which extradition shall be granted and\nasked in return, and which at the same time regulate\nthe procedure in extradition cases. These Municipal\nLaws [669] furnish the basis for the conclusion of extradition\ntreaties. The first in the field with such an extradition\nlaw was Belgium in 1833, which remained, however,\nfor far more than a generation quite isolated. It\nwas not until 1870 that England followed the example\ngiven by Belgium. English public opinion was for\nmany years against extradition treaties at all, considering\nthem as a great danger to individual liberty and to\nthe competence of every State to grant asylum to\npolitical refugees. This country possessed, therefore,\nbefore 1870 a few extradition treaties only, which\nmoreover were in many points inadequate.

Many\nStates, however, as France and most other States of\nthe European continent, have adopted the principle\nnever to extradite one of their subjects to a foreign\nState, but themselves to punish subjects of their own\nfor grave crimes committed abroad. Other States, as\nGreat Britain and the United States, have not adopted\nthis principle, and do extradite such of their subjects\nas have committed a grave crime abroad. Thus Great\nBritain surrendered in 1879 to Austria, where he was\nconvicted and hanged, [674] one Tourville, a British subject,\nwho, after having murdered his wife in the Tyrol, had\nfled home to England. And it must be emphasised\nthat the object of extradition is an individual who has\ncommitted a crime abroad, whether or not he was\nduring the commission of the criminal act physically\npresent on the territory of the State where the crime was\ncommitted. Thus, in 1884, Great Britain surrendered\none Nillins to Germany, who, by sending from Southampton\nforged bills of exchange to a merchant in Germany\nas payment for goods ordered, was considered to [Pg 408] have committed forgery and to have obtained goods\nby false pretences in Germany.

For this reason Italy refused\nto extradite Paladini. It is noteworthy that the\nUnited States, although they do not any longer press\nfor extradition of Italian subjects who, after having\ncommitted a crime in the United States have returned\nto Italy, nevertheless consider themselves bound by\nthe above-mentioned treaty of 1868 to extradite to\nItaly such American subjects as have committed a crime\nin Italy.

On the contrary, whereas extradition [Pg 412] of ordinary criminals was, before the eighteenth\ncentury at least, hardly ever stipulated, treaties very\noften stipulated the extradition of individuals who had\ncommitted such deeds as are nowadays termed \"political\ncrimes,\" and such individuals were frequently\nextradited even when no treaty stipulated it. [683] And\nwriters in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries did\nnot at all object to such practice on the part of the\nStates; on the contrary, they frequently approved of\nit. [684] It is indirectly due to the French Revolution that\nmatters gradually underwent a change, since this event\nwas the starting-point for the revolt in the nineteenth\ncentury against despotism and absolutism throughout\nthe western part of the European continent. It was\nthen that the term \"political crime\" arose, and article\n120 of the French Constitution of 1793 granted asylum\nto foreigners exiled from their home country \"for the\ncause of liberty.\" On the other hand, the French\nemigrants, who had fled from France to escape the\nReign of Terror, found an asylum in foreign States.\nHowever, the modern principle of non-extradition of\npolitical criminals even then did not conquer the world.\nUntil 1830 political criminals frequently were extradited.\nBut public opinion in free countries began gradually to\nrevolt against such extradition, and Great Britain was\nits first opponent. The fact that several political\nfugitives were surrendered by the Governor of Gibraltar\nto Spain created a storm of indignation in Parliament\nin 1815, where Sir James Mackintosh proclaimed the\nprinciple that no nation ought to refuse asylum to\npolitical fugitives. And in 1816 Lord Castlereagh declared\nthat there could be no greater abuse of the law\nthan by allowing it to be the instrument of inflicting\npunishment on foreigners who had committed political [Pg 413] crimes only. The second in the field was Switzerland,\nthe asylum for many political fugitives from neighbouring\ncountries, when, after the final defeat of\nNapoleon, the reactionary Continental monarchs refused\nthe introduction of constitutional reforms which were\ndemanded by their peoples. And although, in 1823,\nSwitzerland was forced by threats of the reactionary\nleading Powers of the Holy Alliance to restrict somewhat\nthe asylum afforded by her to individuals who had\ntaken part in the unsuccessful political revolts in Naples\nand Piedmont, the principle of non-extradition went\non fighting its way. The question as to that asylum\nwas discussed with much passion in the press of Europe.\nAnd although the principle of non-extradition was far\nfrom becoming universally recognised, that discussion\nindirectly fostered its growth. A practical proof thereof\nis that in 1830 even Austria and Prussia, two of the\nreactionary Powers of that time, refused Russia's\ndemand for extradition of fugitives who had taken\npart in the Polish Revolution of that year. And another\nproof thereof is that at about the same time, in\n1829, a celebrated dissertation [685] by a Dutch jurist made\nits appearance, in which the principle of non-extradition\nof political criminals was for the first time defended\nwith juristic arguments and on a juristic basis.",

                                        "On the other hand, a reaction set in in 1833, when\nAustria, Prussia, and Russia concluded treaties which\nremained in force for a generation, and which stipulated\nthat henceforth individuals who had committed crimes\nof high treason and lèse-majesté , or had conspired against\nthe safety of the throne and the legitimate Government,\nor had taken part in a revolt, should be surrendered\nto the State concerned. The same year, however, is\nepoch-making in favour of the principle of non-extradition\nof political criminals, for in 1833 Belgium enacted [Pg 414] her celebrated extradition law, the first of its kind,\nbeing the very first Municipal Law which expressly\ninterdicted the extradition of foreign political criminals.\nAs Belgium, which had seceded from the Netherlands\nin 1830 and became recognised and neutralised by the\nPowers in 1831, owed her very existence to revolt, she\nfelt the duty of making it a principle of her Municipal\nLaw to grant asylum to foreign political fugitives, a\nprinciple which was for the first time put into practice\nin the treaty of extradition concluded in 1834 between\nBelgium and France. The latter, which to the present\nday has no municipal extradition law, has nevertheless\nhenceforth always in her extradition treaties with other\nPowers stipulated the principle of non-extradition of\npolitical criminals. And the other Powers followed\ngradually. Even Russia had to give way, and since\n1867 this principle is to be found in all extradition\ntreaties of Russia with other Powers, that with Spain\nof 1888 excepted. It is due to the stern attitude of\nGreat Britain, Switzerland, Belgium, France, and the\nUnited States that the principle has conquered the\nworld. These countries, in which individual liberty is\nthe very basis of all political life, and constitutional\ngovernment a political dogma of the nation, watched\nwith abhorrence the methods of government of many\nother States between 1815 and 1860. These Governments\nwere more or less absolute and despotic, repressing\nby force every endeavour of their subjects to obtain\nindividual liberty and a share in the government.\nThousands of the most worthy citizens and truest\npatriots had to leave their country for fear of severe\npunishment for political crimes. Great Britain and\nthe other free countries felt in honour bound not to\nsurrender such exiled patriots to the persecution of\ntheir Governments, but to grant them an asylum."

It is unnecessary here to discuss the\nnumerous details of the controversy. It suffices to\nstate that whereas many writers call such crime \"political\"\nas was committed from a political motive, others\ncall \"political\" any crime committed for a political\npurpose; again, others recognise such crime only as\n\"political\" as was committed from a political motive\nand at the same time for a political purpose; and,\nthirdly, some writers confine the term \"political crime\"\nto certain offences against the State only, as high\ntreason, lèse-majesté , and the like.

Some writers deny categorically\nthat such complex crimes are political; but this opinion\nis wrong and dangerous, since indeed many honourable [Pg 416] political criminals would have to be extradited in\nconsequence thereof. On the other hand, it cannot be\ndenied that many cases of complex crimes, although\nthe deed may have been committed from a political\nmotive or for a political purpose, are such as ought not\nto be considered political.

The difficulties are great and partly insuperable\nas long as we do not succeed in finding a satisfactory\nconception of the term \"political crime.\" But such\ndifficulties are only partly, not wholly, insuperable.\nThe step taken by the Swiss extradition law of 1892 is [Pg 421] so far in advance as to meet a great many of the difficulties.\nThere is no doubt that the adoption of the\nSwiss rule by all the other civilised States would improve\nmatters more than the universal adoption of the\nso-called Belgian attentat clause. The fact that according\nto Swiss law each case of complex political crime is\nunravelled and obtains the verdict of an independent\nCourt according to the very circumstances, conditions,\nand requirements under which it occurred, is of the\ngreatest value. It enables every case to be met in such\na way as it deserves, without compromising the Government,\nand without sacrificing the principle of non-extradition\nof political criminals as a valuable rule. I cannot\nsupport the charge made by some writers [698] that the Swiss\nlaw is inadequate because it does not give criteria for\nthe guidance of the Court in deciding whether or no\nextradition for complex crimes should be granted. In\nmy opinion, the very absence of such criteria proves the\nsuperiority of the Swiss clause to the Belgian attentat clause. On the one hand, the latter is quite insufficient,\nfor it restricts its stipulations to murder of heads of\nStates and members of their families only. But I see\nno reason why individuals guilty of any murder—as\nprovided by the Russian proposal—or who have committed\nother crimes, such as arson, theft, and the like,\nshould not be surrendered in case the political motive\nor purpose of the crime is of no importance in comparison\nwith the crime itself. On the other hand, the\nBelgian clause goes too far, since exceptional cases of\nmurder of heads of States from political motives or for\npolitical purposes might occur which do not deserve\nextradition. The Swiss clause, however, with its absence\nof fixed distinctions between such complex crimes\nas are extraditable, and such as are not, permits the\nconsideration of the circumstances, conditions, and [Pg 422] requirements under which a complex crime was committed.\nIt is true that the responsibility of the Court\nof Justice which has to decide whether such a complex\ncrime is extraditable is great. But it is to be taken\nfor granted that such Court will give its decision with\nimpartiality, fairness, and justice.

But recognition of a new head by other\nStates is in every respect a matter of discretion. Neither\nhas a State the right to demand from other States\nrecognition of its new head, nor has any State a right\nto refuse such recognition. Thus Russia, Austria, and\nPrussia refused until 1848 recognition to Isabella, Queen\nof Spain, who had come to the throne as an infant in\n1833. But, practically, in the long run recognition cannot\nbe withheld, for without it international intercourse\nis impossible, and States with self-respect will exercise\nretorsion if recognition is refused to the heads they\nhave chosen.

The fact that the Popes had permanent\nrepresentatives—so-called apocrisiarii or responsales —at\nthe Court of the Frankish Kings and at Constantinople\nuntil the final separation of the Eastern from the [Pg 438] Western Church, ought not to be considered as the\nfirst example of permanent legations, as the task of\nthese papal representatives had nothing to do with\ninternational affairs, but with those of the Church\nonly. It was not until the thirteenth century that the\nfirst permanent legations made their appearance. The\nItalian Republics, and Venice in especial, created the\nexample [713] by keeping representatives stationed at one\nanother's capitals for the better negotiation of their\ninternational affairs. And in the fifteenth century\nthese Republics began to keep permanent representatives\nin Spain, Germany, France, and England. Other\nStates followed the example. Special treaties were often\nconcluded stipulating permanent legations, such as in\n1520, for instance, between the King of England and\nthe Emperor of Germany. From the end of the fifteenth\ncentury England, France, Spain, and Germany kept up\npermanent legations at one another's Courts. But it\nwas not until the second half of the seventeenth century\nthat permanent legations became a general institution,\nthe Powers following the example of France under\nLouis XIV. and Richelieu. It ought to be specially\nmentioned that Grotius [714] thought permanent legations\nto be wholly unnecessary.

The right to send\nsuch envoys is termed active right of legation, in contradistinction\nto the passive right of legation, as the right\nto receive such envoys is termed. Some writers [716] on\nInternational Law assert that no right but a mere\ncompetence to send and receive diplomatic envoys\nexists according to International Law, maintaining that\nno State is bound by International Law to send or\nreceive such envoys. But this is certainly wrong in its\ngenerality. Obviously a State is not bound to send\ndiplomatic envoys or to receive permanent envoys.\nBut, on the other hand, the very existence [717] of the\nFamily of Nations makes it necessary for the members\nor some of the members to negotiate occasionally on\ncertain points. Such negotiation would be impossible\nin case one member could always and under all circumstances\nrefuse to receive an envoy from the other\nmembers.

Practically, however, every\nfull-Sovereign State which desires its voice to be heard\namong the States receives and sends permanent envoys,\nas without such it would, under present circumstances,\nbe impossible for a State to have any influence whatever\nin international affairs. It is for this reason that\nSwitzerland, which in former times abstained entirely\nfrom sending permanent envoys, has abandoned her\nformer practice and nowadays sends and receives\nseveral.

A State may be ready to receive\na permanent or temporary envoy, but may object to\nthe individual selected for that purpose. International\nLaw gives no right to a State to insist upon the reception\nof an individual appointed by it as diplomatic\nenvoy. Every State can refuse to receive as envoy a\nperson objectionable to itself. And a State refusing\nan individual envoy is neither compelled to specify what\nkind of objection it has, nor to justify its objection.\nThus, for example, most States refuse to receive one of\ntheir own subjects as an envoy from a foreign State. [726] Thus, again, the King of Hanover refused in 1847 to\nreceive a minister appointed by Prussia, because the\nindividual was of the Roman Catholic faith. Italy\nrefused in 1885 to receive Mr. Keiley as ambassador of\nthe United States of America because he had in 1871\nprotested against the annexation of the Papal States. [Pg 451] And when the United States sent the same gentleman\nas ambassador to Austria, the latter refused him reception\non the ground that his wife was said to be a Jewess.\nAlthough, as is apparent from these examples, no State\nhas a right to insist upon the reception of a certain\nindividual as envoy, in practice States are often offended\nwhen reception is refused. Thus, in 1832 England did\nnot cancel for three years the appointment of Sir Stratford\nCanning as ambassador to Russia, although the\nlatter refused reception, and the post was practically\nvacant. In 1885, when, as above mentioned, Austria\nrefused reception to Mr. Keiley as ambassador of the\nUnited States, the latter did not appoint another, although\nMr. Keiley resigned, and the legation was for\nseveral years left to the care of a Chargé d'Affaires. [727] To avoid such conflicts it is a good practice of many\nStates never to appoint an individual as envoy without\nhaving ascertained beforehand whether the individual\nwould be persona grata . And it is a customary rule of\nInternational Law that a State which does not object\nto the appointment of a certain individual, when its\nopinion has been asked beforehand, is bound to receive\nsuch individual.

The present\nimmunity of domicile has developed from the former\ncondition of things, when the official residences of envoys\nwere in every point considered to be outside the territory\nof the receiving States, and when this exterritoriality\nwas in many cases even extended to the whole\nquarter of the town in which such a residence was\nsituated. One used then to speak of a Franchise du\nquartier or the Jus quarteriorum . And an inference\nfrom this Franchise du quartier was the so-called right\nof asylum, envoys claiming the right to grant asylum\nwithin the boundaries of their residential quarters to\nevery individual who took refuge there. [743] But already\nin the seventeenth century most States opposed this Franchise du quartier , and it totally disappeared in the\neighteenth century, leaving behind, however, the claim\nof envoys to grant asylum within their official residences.\nThus, when in 1726 the Duke of Ripperda, first\nMinister to Philip V. of Spain, who was accused of high\ntreason and had taken refuge in the residence of the\nEnglish Ambassador in Madrid, was forcibly arrested\nthere by order of the Spanish Government, the British\nGovernment complained of this act as a violation of\nInternational Law. [744] Twenty-one years later, in 1747,\na similar case occurred in Sweden. A merchant named\nSpringer was accused of high treason and took refuge [Pg 462] in the house of the English Ambassador at Stockholm.\nOn the refusal of the English envoy to surrender Springer,\nthe Swedish Government surrounded the embassy with\ntroops and ordered the carriage of the envoy, when\nleaving the embassy, to be followed by mounted soldiers.\nAt last Springer was handed over to the Swedish\nGovernment under protest, but England complained and\ncalled back her ambassador, as Sweden refused to make\nthe required reparation. [745] As these two examples show,\nthe right of asylum, although claimed and often conceded,\nwas nevertheless not universally recognised.\nDuring the nineteenth century all remains of it vanished,\nand when in 1867 the French envoy in Lima\nclaimed it, the Peruvian Government refused to concede\nit. [746]",
                                        "[Footnote 743: Although this right of asylum was certainly recognised by\nthe States in former centuries, it is of interest to note that Grotius\ndid not consider it postulated by International Law, for he says of this\nright (II. c. 18, § 8): \"Ex concessione pendet ejus apud quem agit.\nIstud enim juris gentium non est.\" See also Bynkershoek, \"De foro\nlegat.\" c. 21.]",

It is, however, acknowledged that this right is not based\nupon a rule of International Law, but merely upon local usage. See\nHall, § 52; Westlake, I. p. 272; Moore, II. §§ 291-304; Chilbert in A.J.\nIII. (1909), pp. 562-595; Robbin in R.G. XV.

See, however, Moore, II.\n§ 293.]",
                                        "Nowadays the official residences of envoys are in\na sense and in some respects only considered as though\nthey were outside the territory of the receiving States.\nFor the immunity of domicile granted to diplomatic\nenvoys comprises the inaccessibility of these residences\nto officers of justice, police, or revenue, and the like,\nof the receiving States without the special consent of\nthe respective envoys. Therefore, no act of jurisdiction\nor administration of the receiving Governments\ncan take place within these residences, except by special\npermission of the envoys. And the stables and carriages\nof envoys are considered to be parts of their [Pg 463] residences. But such immunity of domicile is granted\nonly in so far as it is necessary for the independence\nand inviolability of envoys and the inviolability of\ntheir official documents and archives. If an envoy\nabuses this immunity, the receiving Government need\nnot bear it passively. There is, therefore, no obligation\non the part of the receiving State to grant an\nenvoy the right of affording asylum to criminals or to\nother individuals not belonging to his suite. Of course,\nan envoy need not deny entrance to criminals who\nwant to take refuge in the embassy. But he must\nsurrender them to the prosecuting Government at its\nrequest, and, if he refuses, any measures may be taken\nto induce him to do so, apart from such as would involve\nan attack on his person. Thus, the embassy may\nbe surrounded by soldiers, and eventually the criminal\nmay even forcibly be taken out of the embassy. But\nsuch measures of force are justifiable only if the case is\nan urgent one, and after the envoy has in vain been\nrequired to surrender the criminal. Further, if a crime\nis committed inside the house of an envoy by an individual\nwho does not enjoy personally the privilege of\nexterritoriality, the criminal must be surrendered to\nthe local Government. The case of Nikitschenkow,\nwhich occurred in Paris in 1867, is an instance thereof.\nNikitschenkow, a Russian subject not belonging to the\nRussian Legation, made an attempt on and wounded a\nmember of that legation within the precincts of the\nembassy. The French police were called in and arrested\nthe criminal. The Russian Government required his\nextradition, maintaining that, as the crime was committed\ninside the Russian Embassy, it fell exclusively\nunder Russian jurisdiction; but the French Government\nrefused extradition and Russia dropped her claim.",
                                        "Again, an envoy has no right to seize a subject of\nhis home State who is within the boundaries of the [Pg 464] receiving State and keep him under arrest inside the\nembassy with the intention of bringing him away into\nthe power of his home State. An instance thereof is\nthe case of the Chinaman Sun Yat Sen which occurred\nin London in 1896. This was a political refugee from\nChina living in London. He was induced to enter the\nhouse of the Chinese Legation and kept under arrest\nthere in order to be conveyed forcibly to China, the\nChinese envoy contending that, as the house of the\nlegation was Chinese territory, the English Government\nhad no right to interfere. But the latter did interfere,\nand Sun Yat Sen was released after several days.",
                                        "As a contrast to this case may be mentioned that\nof Kalkstein which occurred on the Continent in 1670.\nColonel von Kalkstein, a Prussian subject, had fled to\nPoland for political reasons since he was accused of\nhigh treason against the Prussian Government. Now\nFrederic William, the great Elector of Brandenburg,\nordered his diplomatic envoy at Warsaw, the capital\nof Poland, to obtain possession of the person of Kalkstein.\nOn November 28, 1670, this order was carried\nout. Kalkstein was secretly seized, and, wrapped up\nin a carpet, was carried across the frontier. He was\nafterwards executed at Memel."

If, however,\nan envoy chooses for himself to appear as a witness or\nto give evidence of any kind, the Courts can make use\nof such evidence. A remarkable case of this kind is\nthat of the Dutch envoy Dubois in Washington, which\nhappened in 1856. A case of homicide occurred in [Pg 466] the presence of M. Dubois, and, as his evidence was\nabsolutely necessary for the trial, the Foreign Secretary\nof the United States asked Dubois to appear before the\nCourt as a witness, recognising the fact that Dubois had\nno duty to do so. When Dubois, on the advice of all\nthe other diplomatic envoys in Washington, refused to\ncomply with this desire, the United States brought the\nmatter before the Dutch Government. The latter, however,\napproved of Dubois' refusal, but authorised him to\ngive evidence under oath before the American Foreign\nSecretary. As, however, such evidence would have had\nno value at all according to the local law, Dubois' evidence\nwas not taken, and the Government of the United\nStates asked the Dutch Government to recall him.

But matters are different when an [Pg 470] envoy on his way from his own State to the State of his\ndestination travels through the territory of a third\nState. If the sending and the receiving States are not\nneighbours, the envoy probably has to travel through\nthe territory of a third State. Now, as the institution\nof legation is a necessary one for the intercourse of\nStates and is firmly established by International Law,\nthere ought to be no doubt whatever that such third\nState must grant the right of innocent passage ( jus\ntransitus innoxii ) to the envoy, provided that it is not\nat war with the sending or the receiving State. But\nno other privileges, [753] especially those of inviolability\nand exterritoriality need be granted to the envoy.\nAnd the right of innocent passage does not include the\nright to stop on the territory longer than is necessary\nfor the passage. Thus, in 1854, Soulé, the envoy of\nthe United States of America at Madrid, who had\nlanded at Calais, intending to return to Madrid via Paris, was provisionally stopped at Calais for the purpose\nof ascertaining whether he intended to make a\nstay in Paris, which the French Government wanted to\nprevent, because he was a French refugee naturalised\nin America and was reported to have made speeches\nagainst the Emperor Napoleon.

In the commercial\ntowns of Italy, Spain, and France the merchants\nused to appoint by election one or more of their\nfellow-merchants as arbitrators in commercial disputes,\nwho were called Juges Consuls or Consuls Marchands .\nWhen, between and after the Crusades, Italian, Spanish,\nand French merchants settled down in the Eastern\ncountries, founding factories, they brought the institution\nof consuls with them, the merchants belonging to\nthe same nation electing their own consul. The competence\nof these consuls became, however, more and\nmore enlarged through treaties, so-called \"Capitulations,\"\nbetween the home States of the merchants and [Pg 483] the Mohammedan monarchs on whose territories these\nmerchants had settled down. [770] The competence of\nconsuls comprised at last the whole civil and criminal\njurisdiction over, and protection of, the privileges, the\nlife, and the property of their countrymen. From the\nEast the institution of consuls was transferred to the\nWest. Thus, in the fifteenth century Italian consuls\nexisted in the Netherlands and in London, English\nconsuls in the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Denmark,\nItaly (Pisa). These consuls in the West exercised, just\nas those in the East, exclusive civil and criminal jurisdiction\nover the merchants of their nationality. But\nthe position of the consuls in the West decayed in the\nbeginning of the seventeenth century through the influence\nof the rising permanent legations on the one hand,\nand, on the other, from the fact that everywhere foreign\nmerchants were brought under the civil and criminal\njurisdiction of the State in which they resided. This\nchange in their competence altered the position of\nconsuls in the Christian States of the West altogether.\nTheir functions now shrank into a general supervision\nof the commerce and navigation of their home States,\nand into a kind of protection of the commercial interests\nof their countrymen. Consequently, they did not receive\nmuch notice in the seventeenth and eighteenth\ncenturies, and it was not until the nineteenth century\nthat the general development of international commerce,\nnavigation, and shipping drew the attention of\nthe Governments again to the value and importance of\nthe institution of consuls. The institution was now\nsystematically developed. The position of the consuls,\ntheir functions, and their privileges, were the subjects\nof stipulations either in commercial treaties or in special\nconsular treaties, [771] and the several States enacted statutes [Pg 484] regarding the duties of their consuls abroad, such as\nthe Consular Act passed by England in 1826.

Such rights as they have\nare granted to them by Municipal Laws in compliance\nwith rights of the appointing States according to\nInternational Law. [779] As regards their position, it should\nnowadays be an established and uncontested fact that\nconsuls do not enjoy the position of diplomatic envoys,\nsince no Christian State actually grants to foreign\nconsuls the privileges of diplomatic agents. On the\nother hand, it would be incorrect to maintain that their\nposition is in no way different from that of any other\nindividual living within the consular district. Since\nthey are appointed by foreign States and have received\nthe exequatur , they are publicly recognised by the admitting\nState as agents of the appointing State. Of\ncourse, consuls are not diplomatic representatives, for\nthey do not represent the appointing States in the\ntotality of their international relations, but for a limited\nnumber of tasks and for local purposes only. Yet they [Pg 494] bear a recognised public character, in contradistinction\nto mere private individuals, and, consequently, their\nposition is different from that of mere private individuals.\nThis is certainly the case with regard to\nprofessional consuls, who are officials of their home\nState and are specially sent to the foreign State for the\npurpose of administering the consular office. But in\nregard to non-professional consuls it must likewise be\nmaintained that the admitting State by granting the exequatur recognises their official position towards itself,\nwhich demands at least a special protection [780] of their\npersons and residences. The official position of consuls,\nhowever, does not involve direct intercourse with\nthe Government of the admitting State. Consuls are\nappointed for local purposes only, and they have, therefore,\ndirect intercourse with the local authorities only.\nIf they want to approach the Government itself, they\ncan do so only through the diplomatic envoy, to whom\nthey are subordinate.",

On September 25, 1908, six soldiers—three\nof them Germans—belonging to the French\nForeign Legion which formed part of the French troops\nat Morocco, deserted at Casa Blanca and asked for and\nobtained the protection of the local German consul,\nwho intended to take them on board a German vessel\nlying in the harbour of Casa Blanca. On their way to\nthe ship, however, they were forcibly taken by the\nFrench out of the custody of the secretary of the German\nConsulate and a native soldier in the service of the\nconsulate who were conducting them. Considering all\nGermans in Morocco without exception exterritorial\nand under the exclusive jurisdiction of her consul,\nGermany complained of this act of force and demanded\nthat those of the deserters concerned who were German\nsubjects should be given up to her by France, acknowledging\nthe fact that the consul had no right to extend [Pg 503] his protection to other than German subjects. France\nrefused to concede this demand, maintaining that the\nindividuals concerned had even after their desertion\nremained under the exclusive jurisdiction of their corps,\nwhich formed part of a French force occupying foreign\nterritory. As the parties could not settle the conflict\ndiplomatically, they agreed, on November 24, 1908, to\nbring it before the Hague Court of Arbitration, which\ngave its award [788] on May 22, 1909, on the whole in favour\nof France. The Court considered: that there was a\nconflict of jurisdiction with regard to the German deserters\nbecause they were as German subjects under the\nexclusive jurisdiction of the German Consulate, but as\ndeserters from the French Foreign Legion under the\nexclusive jurisdiction of the French Army of Occupation;\nthat under the circumstances of the case the\njurisdiction of the Army of Occupation should have\nthe preference; that nevertheless the German consul\nwas not to be blamed for his action on account of the\nfact that in a country granting exterritorial jurisdiction\nto foreigners the question of the respective competency\nof the consular jurisdiction and of the jurisdiction of\nan Army of Occupation was very complicated and had\nnever been settled in an express, distinct, and universally\nrecognised manner; that, since the German\ndeserters were found at the port under the actual protection\nof the German Consulate and this protection\nwas not manifestly illegal, the actual situation should,\nas far as possible, have been respected by the French\nmilitary authority; that therefore the French military\nauthorities ought to have confined themselves to preventing\nthe embarkation and escape of the deserters,\nand, before proceeding to their arrest and imprisonment,\nto have offered to leave them in sequestration of the [Pg 504] German Consulate until the question of the competent\njurisdiction had been decided. The Court did not,\nhowever, decree the restitution on the part of France\nof the three German deserters to Germany. [789]",

But it is a well-known fact that Courts of Arbitration\nfrequently endeavour to give an award which satisfies both parties and\nthe ambiguity of the award in the Casa Blanca incident is manifestly due\nto this fact.

No official of the littoral State is allowed to\nboard the vessel without special permission of the\ncommander. Crimes committed on board by persons\nin the service of the vessel are under the exclusive jurisdiction\nof the commander and the other home authorities.\nIndividuals who are subjects of the littoral State\nand are only temporarily on board may, although they\nneed not, be taken to the home country of the vessel,\nto be there punished if they commit a crime on board.\nEven individuals who do not belong to the crew, and\nwho after having committed a crime on the territory\nof the littoral State have taken refuge on board, cannot\nbe forcibly taken off the vessel; if the commander\nrefuses their surrender, it can be obtained only by\nmeans of diplomacy from the home State.",

On the change of doctrines formerly held in\nthis country and the United States of America, see Hall, § 54, and\nLawrence, § 107.

Thus, in the case of the Exchange (7 Cranch, 116), the Supreme Court of the United States\nrecognised the fact that the latter had no jurisdiction over this French\nman-of-war. In the case of the Constitution , an American man-of-war,\nthe High Court of Admiralty in 1879 held that foreign public ships\ncannot be sued in English Courts for salvage (L.R. 4 P.D. 39).

A man-of-war which refuses to do so can be expelled,\nand, if on such or other occasions she commits [Pg 508] acts of violence against the officials of the littoral State\nor against other vessels, steps may be taken against her\nto prevent further acts of violence.

The following\nare the more important stipulations of this\nConvention concerning the constitution [828] of the Court:—The\nCourt consists of fifteen judges and fifteen deputy-judges,\nwho are appointed for a period of six years and\nwho rank equally and have precedence according to\nthe date of the notification of their appointment, but\nthe deputy judges rank after the judges (articles 10 to\n12). Of the fifteen judges of which the Court is composed,\nnine constitute a quorum; a judge who is absent\nor prevented from sitting is replaced by his deputy judge\n(article 14). The judges enjoy diplomatic privileges\nand immunities in the performance of their duties [Pg 523] when outside their own country (article 13). Each\ncontracting Power appoints one judge and one deputy\njudge, and the judges appointed by Great Britain,\nGermany, the United States of America, Austria-Hungary,\nFrance, Italy, Japan, and Russia are always\nsummoned to sit, whereas the judges appointed by the\nother contracting Powers sit by rota, as shown in the\ntable annexed to the Convention (article 15). If a\nbelligerent Power has, according to the rota, no judge\nsitting in the Court, it may ask that the judge appointed\nby it shall take part in the settlement of all cases arising\nfrom the war; lots shall then be drawn as to which of\nthe judges entitled to sit according to the rota shall\nwithdraw, and this arrangement does not affect the\njudge appointed by the other belligerent (article 16).\nNo judge can sit who has been a party, in any way\nwhatever, to the sentence pronounced by the National\nCourts, or has taken part in the case as counsel or\nadvocate for one of the parties; no judge or deputy\njudge can, during his tenure of office, appear as agent\nor advocate before the International Prize Court, nor\nact for one of the parties in any capacity whatever\n(article 17). The belligerent captor is entitled to appoint\na naval officer of high rank to sit as assessor, but\nwith no voice in the decision; a neutral Power, which\nis a party to the proceedings or whose national is a\nparty, has the same right of appointment; if in applying\nthis last provision more than one Power is concerned,\nthey must agree among themselves, if necessary\nby lot, on the officer to be appointed (article 18). The\nCourt elects its President and Vice-President by an\nabsolute majority of the votes cast; after two ballots,\nthe election is made by a bare majority, and, in case\nthe votes are equal, by lot (article 19). The judges of\nthe International Prize Court are entitled to travelling\nallowances in accordance with the regulations in force [Pg 524] in their own country, and in addition thereto receive,\nwhile the Court is sitting or while they are carrying\nout duties conferred upon them by the Court, a sum\nof 100 Netherland florins per diem; the judges may\nnot receive from their own Governments or from that\nof any other Power any remuneration in their capacity\nof members of the Court (article 20). The seat of the\nInternational Prize Court is at the Hague, and it cannot,\nexcept in the case of force majeure , be transferred elsewhere\nwithout the consent of the belligerents (article 21).",

For, firstly, it is not itself\na deciding tribunal, but only a list of names out of\nwhich the parties in each case elect some members\nand thereby constitute the Court. Secondly, experience\nteaches that a Court of Arbitration endeavours more to\ngive an award ex aequo et bono which more or less pleases\nboth parties than to decide the conflict in a judicial\nmanner by simply applying strict legal rules without\nany consideration as to whether or no the decision\nwill please either party. Thirdly, since in conflicts to\nbe decided by arbitration the arbitrators each time\nare selected by the parties, there are in most cases\ndifferent individuals acting as arbitrators, so that there\nis no continuity in the administration of justice.",

Such a Court would only take the\nlegal aspects of the case into consideration and would\nbase its decision on mere legal deliberations. It would\nsecure continuity in the administration of international [Pg 525] justice, because it would in each case consider itself\nbound by its former decisions. It would in time build\nup a valuable practice by deciding innumerable controversies\nwhich as yet haunt the theory of International\nLaw. The second Hague Peace Conference of 1907\ntherefore discussed the question of creating such a\nCourt, but only produced the draft of a Convention\nconcerning the subject. It is, however, to be regretted\nthat this draft Convention speaks of the creation of a\njudicial \"Arbitration\" Court, and thereby obliterates\nthe boundary line between the arbitral and the strictly\njudicial decision of international disputes; it would\nhave been better to speak simply of an International\nCourt of Justice. However that may be, there is no\ndoubt that the near future will bring the establishment\nof such a Court of Justice in contradistinction to the\nPermanent Court of Arbitration, for the parties to a\nconflict frequently hesitate to have it settled by arbitration,\nwhereas they would be glad to have it settled\nby a strictly judicial decision of the legal questions involved.\nThe same motives which urged the Powers to\nleave aside the Permanent Court of Arbitration in Prize\nCases and to enter into a Convention for the establishment\nof a real International Prize Court, will in time\ncompel the Powers to establish a real International\nCourt of Justice.

Although a treaty\nis concluded as soon as the mutual consent is manifest\nfrom acts of the duly authorised representatives, its\nbinding force is as a rule suspended till ratification is\ngiven. The function of ratification is, therefore, to\nmake the treaty binding, and, if it is refused, the treaty\nfalls to the ground in consequence. As long as ratification\nis not given, the treaty is, although concluded, not\nperfect. Many writers [869] maintain that, as a treaty is\nnot binding without ratification, it is the latter which\nreally contains the mutual consent and really concludes\nthe treaty. Before ratification, they maintain, there is\nno treaty concluded, but a mere mutual proposal agreed\nto to conclude a treaty. But this opinion does not\naccord with the real facts. [870] For the representatives\nare authorised and intend to conclude a treaty by their\nsignatures.

The rationale for the institution of ratification\nis another argument for the contention that the\nconclusion of the treaty by the representatives is to be\ndistinguished from the confirmation given by the\nrespective States through ratification. The reason is\nthat States want to have an opportunity of re-examining\nnot the single stipulations, but the whole effect of\nthe treaty upon their interests. These interests may\nbe of various kinds. They may undergo a change\nimmediately after the signing of the treaty by the\nrepresentatives. They may appear to public opinion\nin a different light from that in which they appear to\nthe Governments, so that the latter want to reconsider\nthe matter. Another reason is that treaties on many\nimportant matters are, according to the Constitutional\nLaw of most States, not valid without some kind of\nconsent of Parliaments. Governments must therefore\nhave an opportunity of withdrawing from a treaty in\ncase Parliaments refuse their recognition.

Although it is now a\nuniversally recognised customary rule of International\nLaw that treaties are regularly in need of ratification,\neven if the latter was not expressly stipulated, there [Pg 555] are exceptions to the rule. For treaties concluded by\nsuch State functionaries [871] as have within certain narrow\nlimits, ipso facto by their office, the power to exercise\nthe treaty-making competence of their State do not\nwant ratification, but are binding at once when they\nare concluded, provided the respective functionaries\nhave not exceeded their powers. Further, treaties\nconcluded by heads of States in person do not want\nratification provided that they do not concern matters\nin regard to which constitutional restrictions [872] are\nimposed upon heads of States. And, lastly, it may\nhappen that the contracting parties stipulate expressly,\nfor the sake of a speedy execution of a treaty, that it\nshall be binding at once without ratifications being\nnecessary. Thus, the Treaty of London of July 15,\n1840, between Great Britain, Austria, Russia, Prussia,\nand Turkey concerning the pacification of the Turko-Egyptian\nconflict was accompanied by a secret protocol, [873] signed by the representatives of the parties,\naccording to which the treaty was at once, without\nbeing ratified, to be executed. For the Powers were,\non account of the victories of Mehemet Ali, very anxious\nto settle the conflict as quickly as possible. But it\nmust be emphasised that renunciation of ratification\nis valid only if given by representatives duly authorised\nto make such renunciation. If the representatives\nhave not received a special authorisation to dispense\nwith ratification, then renunciation is not binding upon\nthe States which they represent.",

Formerly [874] it was maintained\nthat ratification could not be refused in case the representatives\nhad not exceeded their powers or violated\ntheir secret instructions. But nowadays there is probably\nno publicist who maintains that a State is in any\ncase legally [875] bound not to refuse ratification. Yet\nmany insist that a State is, except for just reasons, in\nprinciple morally bound not to refuse ratification. I\ncannot see, however, the value of such a moral in contradistinction\nto a legal duty. The fact upon which everybody\nagrees is that International Law does in no case\nimpose a duty of ratification upon a contracting party.\nA State refusing ratification will always have reasons\nfor such line of action which appear just to itself,\nalthough they may be unjust in the eyes of others. In\npractice, ratification is given or withheld at discretion.\nBut in the majority of cases, of course, ratification is\nnot refused. A State which often and apparently\nwantonly refused ratification of treaties would lose all\ncredit in international negotiations and would soon feel\nthe consequences. On the other hand, it is impossible [Pg 557] to lay down hard-and-fast rules respecting just and\nunjust causes of refusal of ratification. The interests\nat stake are so various, and the circumstances which\nmust influence a State are so imponderable, that it must\nbe left to the discretion of every State to decide the\nquestion for itself.

According to the principle pacta tertiis nec\nnocent nec prosunt , a treaty concerns the contracting\nStates only; neither rights nor duties, as a rule, arise\nunder a treaty for third States which are not parties to\nthe treaty. But sometimes treaties have indeed an effect\nupon third States. Such an effect is always produced\nwhen a treaty touches previous treaty rights of third\nStates. Thus, for instance, a commercial treaty conceding\nmore favourable conditions than hitherto have\nbeen conceded by the parties thereto has an effect upon\nall such third States as have previously concluded commercial\ntreaties containing the so-called most-favoured-nation\nclause [888] with one of the contracting parties.",

Thus, the Hay-Pauncefote Treaty\nbetween Great Britain and the United States of 1901, [Pg 564] and the Hay-Varilla Treaty between the United States\nand Panama of 1903, stipulate that the Panama Canal\nto be built shall be open to vessels of commerce and of\nwar of all nations, although Great Britain, the United\nStates, and Panama only are parties. [889] Thus, further,\narticle 5 of the Boundary Treaty of Buenos Ayres of\nSeptember 15, 1881, stipulates that the Straits of\nMagellan shall be open to vessels of all nations, although\nArgentina and Chili only are parties. Again, the Treaty\nof Paris, signed on March 30, 1856, and annexed to the\nPeace Treaty of Paris of 1856, stipulates that Russia\nshall not fortify the Aland [890] Islands; although this\nstipulation was made in the interest of Sweden, only\nGreat Britain, France, and Russia are parties. I believe\nthat the question must be answered in the negative,\nand nothing prevents the contracting parties from\naltering such a treaty without the consent of third States,\nprovided the latter have not in the meantime acquired\nsuch rights through the unanimous tacit consent of all\nconcerned.",

Although, as just stated, treaties concluded\nfor a certain period of time, and such treaties as are\napparently intended or expressly contracted for the\npurpose of setting up an everlasting condition of things,\ncannot in principle be dissolved by withdrawal of one\nof the parties, there is an exception to this rule. For\nit is an almost universally recognised fact that vital\nchanges of circumstances may be of such a kind as to\njustify a party in notifying an unnotifiable treaty.\nThe vast majority of publicists, as well as all the Governments\nof the members of the Family of Nations, defend [Pg 573] the principle Conventio omnis intelligitur rebus sic\nstantibus , and they agree, [902] therefore, that all treaties\nare concluded under the tacit condition rebus sic stantibus .\nThat this condition involves a certain amount of\ndanger cannot be denied, for it can be, and indeed\nsometimes has been, abused for the purpose of hiding\nthe violation of treaties behind the shield of law, and\nof covering shameful wrong with the mantle of righteousness.\nBut all this cannot alter the fact that this exceptional\ncondition is as necessary for International\nlaw and international intercourse as the very rule pacta sunt servanda . When, for example, the existence\nor the necessary development of a State stands in\nunavoidable conflict with such State's treaty obligations,\nthe latter must give way, for self-preservation\nand development in accordance with the growth and\nthe necessary requirements of the nation are the primary\nduties of every State. No State would consent to any\nsuch treaty as would hinder it in the fulfilment of\nthese primary duties. The consent of a State to a\ntreaty presupposes a conviction that such treaty is not\nfraught with danger to its existence and development,\nand implies a condition that, if by an unforeseen change\nof circumstances the obligations stipulated in the treaty\nshould imperil the said State's existence and necessary\ndevelopment, the treaty, although by its nature unnotifiable,\nshould nevertheless be notifiable.",
                                        "[Footnote 902: See\n Bonucci in Z.V. IV. (1910), pp. 449-471.

Some few writers, however, disagree altogether, as, for\ninstance, Bynkershoek, \"Quest. jur. public.,\" II. c. 10, and Wildman,\n\"Institutes of International Law,\" I. (1849), p. 175. Schmidt, op. cit.\npp. 97-118, would seem to reject the clausula altogether, but can\nnevertheless not help recognising it in the end. A good survey of the\npractice of the States in the matter during the nineteenth century is\ngiven by Kaufmann, op. cit. pp. 12-37.]",
                                        "The danger of the clause rebus sic stantibus is to be\nfound in the elastic meaning of the term \"vital changes\nof circumstances,\" as, after all, a State must in every [Pg 574] special case judge for itself whether or no there is a\nvital change of circumstances justifying its withdrawal\nfrom an unnotifiable treaty. On the other hand, the\ndanger is counterbalanced by the fact that the frequent\nand unjustifiable use of the clause rebus sic stantibus by\na State would certainly destroy all its credit among the\nnations.",
                                        "Be that as it may, it is generally agreed that certainly\nnot every change of circumstances justifies a State\nin making use of the clause. All agree that, although\ntreaty obligations may through a change of circumstances\nbecome disagreeable, burdensome, and onerous,\nthey must nevertheless be discharged. All agree,\nfurther, that a change of government and even a change\nin the form of a State, such as the turning of a monarchy\ninto a republic and vice versa , does not alone and in\nitself justify a State in notifying such a treaty as is by\nits nature unnotifiable. On the other hand, all agree\nin regard to many cases in which the clause rebus sic\nstantibus could justly be made use of. Thus, for example,\nif a State enters into a treaty of alliance for a\ncertain period of time, and if before the expiration of\nthe alliance a change of circumstances occurs, so that\nnow the alliance endangers the very existence of one\nof the contracting parties, all will agree that the clause rebus sic stantibus would justify such party in notifying\nthe treaty of alliance.",
                                        "A certain amount of disagreement as to the cases\nin which the clause might or might not be justly applied\nwill of course always remain. But the fact is\nremarkable that during the nineteenth century not\nmany cases of the application of the clause have occurred.\nAnd the States and public opinion everywhere\nhave come to the conviction that the clause rebus sic\nstantibus ought not to give the right to a State at once to\nliberate itself from the obligations of a treaty, but only [Pg 575] the claim to be released from these obligations by the\nother parties to the treaty. Accordingly, when a State\nis of the opinion that the obligations of a treaty have\nthrough a vital change of circumstances become unbearable,\nit should first approach the other party or parties\nand request them to abrogate the treaty. And it is only\nwhen such abrogation is refused that a State may\nperhaps be justified in declaring that it could no longer\nconsider itself bound by the obligations concerned.\nThus, when, in 1870, during the Franco-German War,\nRussia declared her withdrawal from such stipulations\nof the Treaty of Paris of 1856 as concerned the neutralisation\nof the Black Sea and the restriction imposed\nupon Russia in regard to men-of-war in that sea, Great\nBritain protested, and a conference was held in London\nin 1871. Although by a treaty signed on March 13,\n1871, this conference, consisting of the signatory Powers\nof the Treaty of Paris—namely, Austria, England,\nFrance, Germany, Italy, Russia, and Turkey—complied\nwith the wishes of Russia and abolished the neutralisation\nof the Black Sea, it adopted in a protocol [903] of\nJanuary 17, 1871, the following declaration:—\"Que\nc'est un principe essentiel du droit des gens qu'aucune\nPuissance ne peut se délier des engagements d'un\ntraité, ni en modifier les stipulations, qu'à la suite de\nl'assentiment des parties contractantes, au moyen d'une\nentente amicale.\"",

[904] The signatory Powers of the\nTreaty of Berlin seem to have tacitly consented, with\nthe exception of Great Britain, which protested. Again,\nin October 1908, Austria-Hungary, in defiance of article [Pg 576] 25 of the Treaty of Berlin, 1878, proclaimed her sovereignty\nover Bosnia and Herzegovina, which hitherto\nhad been under her occupation and administration,\nand simultaneously Bulgaria, in defiance of article 1\nof the same treaty, declared herself independent. [905] Thus the standard value of the Declaration of the Conference\nof London of 1871 has become doubtful again.",

There is hardly\nany doubt that, if Austria-Hungary had not ignored the above-mentioned\nDeclaration contained in the protocol of January 17, 1871, and had\napproached the Powers in the matter, the abrogation of article 25 of the\nTreaty of Berlin would have been granted and she would have been allowed\nto annex Bosnia and Herzegovina after having indemnified Turkey. This is\nto be inferred from the fact that, when Austria-Hungary proclaimed her\nsovereignty over the provinces, Turkey accepted compensation, and the\nPowers, which first had protested and demanded an international\nconference, consented to the abrogation of the Treaty of Berlin.]"

There is no unanimity among\nwriters on International Law in regard to this point,\nin so far as a minority makes a distinction between\nessential and non-essential stipulations of the treaty,\nand maintains that violation of essential stipulations\nonly creates a right for the other party to cancel the\ntreaty. But the majority of writers rightly oppose\nthis distinction, maintaining that it is not always\npossible to distinguish essential from non-essential\nstipulations, that the binding force of a treaty protects\nnon-essential stipulations as well as essential ones,\nand that it is for the faithful party to consider for\nitself whether violation of a treaty, even in its least\nessential parts, justifies the cancelling of the treaty.\nThe case, however, is different when a treaty expressly\nstipulates that it should not be considered broken by\nviolation of merely one or another part of it. And it\nmust be emphasised that the right to cancel the treaty\non the ground of its violation must be exercised within\na reasonable time after the violation has become known.\nIf the Power possessing such right does not exercise it\nin due time, it must be taken for granted that such right\nhas been waived. A mere protest, such as the protest of\nEngland in 1886 when Russia withdrew from article\n59 of the Treaty of Berlin of 1878, which stipulated\nthe freedom of the port of Batoum, neither constitutes\na cancellation nor reserves the right of cancellation."

Grotius and the later authorities applied the\nrules of Roman Law respecting interpretation in general\nto interpretation of treaties. On the whole, such application\nis correct in so far as those rules of Roman\nLaw are full of common sense. But it must be emphasised\nthat interpretation of treaties is in the first instance\na matter of consent between the contracting\nparties. If they choose a certain interpretation, no\nother has any basis. It is only when they disagree that\nan interpretation based on scientific grounds can ask\na hearing. And these scientific grounds can be no\nother than those provided by jurisprudence. The best\nmeans of settling questions of interpretation, provided\nthe parties cannot come to terms, is arbitration, as the\nappointed arbitrators will apply the general rules of\njurisprudence. Now in regard to interpretation given\nby the parties themselves, there are two different ways\nopen to them. They may either agree informally upon\nthe interpretation and execute the treaty accordingly;\nor they may make an additional new treaty and stipulate [Pg 583] therein such interpretation of the previous treaty\nas they choose. In the latter case one speaks of\n\"authentic\" interpretation in analogy with the authentic\ninterpretation of Municipal Law given expressly\nby a statute. Nowadays treaties very often contain\nthe so-called \"compromise clause\" as regards interpretation—namely,\nthe clause that, in case the parties\nshould not agree on questions of interpretation, these\nquestions shall be settled by arbitration.

But the duty of the guarantor to render, even\nby compulsion, the promised assistance to the guaranteed\ndepends upon many conditions and circumstances.\nThus, first, the guaranteed must request the guarantor\nto render assistance. When, for instance, the possession\nof a certain part of its territory is guaranteed\nto a State which after its defeat in a war with a third [Pg 601] State agrees as a condition of peace to cede such piece\nof territory to the victor without having requested the\nintervention of the guarantor, the latter has neither a\nright nor a duty to interfere. Thus, secondly, the\nguarantor must at the critical time be able to render\nthe required assistance. When, for instance, its hands\nare tied through waging war against a third State, or\nwhen it is so weak through internal troubles or other\nfactors that its interference would expose it to a serious\ndanger, it is not bound to fulfil the request for assistance.\nSo too, when the guaranteed has not complied\nwith previous advice given by the guarantor as to the\nline of its behaviour, it is not the guarantor's duty\nto render assistance afterwards.",
                                        "It is impossible to state all the circumstances and\nconditions upon which the fulfilment of the duty of the\nguarantor depends, as every case must be judged upon\nits own merits. And it is certain that, more frequently\nthan in other cases, changes in political constellations\nand the general developments of events may involve\nsuch vital change of circumstances as to justify [944] a\nState in refusing to interfere in spite of a treaty\nof guarantee. It is for this reason that treaties of\nguarantee to secure permanently a certain object to a\nState are naturally of a more or less precarious value\nto the latter. The practical value, therefore, of a\nguarantee treaty, whatever may be its formal character,\nwould as a rule seem to extend to the early years only\nof its existence while the original conditions still obtain.",

In contradistinction to treaties constituting\na guarantee on the part of one or more States severally,\nthe effect of treaties constituting a collective guarantee\non the part of several States requires special consideration.\nOn June 20, 1867, Lord Derby maintained [945] in\nthe House of Lords concerning the collective guarantee [Pg 602] by the Powers of the neutralisation of Luxemburg that\nin case of a collective guarantee each guarantor had\nonly the duty to act according to the treaty when all\nthe other guarantors were ready to act likewise; that,\nconsequently, if one of the guarantors themselves\nshould violate the neutrality of Luxemburg, the duty\nto act according to the treaty of collective guarantee\nwould not accrue to the other guarantors. This opinion\nis certainly not correct, [946] and I do not know of any\npublicist who would or could approve of it. There\nought to be no doubt that in a case of collective guarantee\none of the guarantors alone cannot be considered bound\nto act according to the treaty of guarantee. For a\ncollective guarantee can have the meaning only that\nthe guarantors should act in a body. But if one of the\nguarantors themselves violates the object of his own\nguarantee, the body of the guarantors remains, and\nit is certainly their duty to act against such faithless\nco-guarantor. If, however, the majority, [947] and therefore\nthe body of the guarantors, were to violate the\nvery object of their guarantee, the duty to act against\nthem would not accrue to the minority.",

Commercial treaties are treaties concerning\nthe commerce and navigation of the contracting States\nand concerning the subjects of these States who are\nengaged in commerce and navigation. Incidentally, however,\nthey also contain clauses concerning consuls and\nvarious other matters. They are concluded either for a\nlimited or an unlimited number of years, and either for\nthe whole territory of one or either party or only for a\npart of such territory— e.g. , by Great Britain for the\nUnited Kingdom alone, or for Canada alone, and the\nlike. All full-Sovereign States are competent to enter\ninto commercial treaties, but it depends upon the\nspecial case whether half- and part-Sovereign States are\nlikewise competent. Although competent to enter upon\ncommercial treaties, a State may, by an international\ncompact, be restricted in its freedom with regard to\nits commercial policy. Thus, according to articles 1\nto 5 of the General Act of the Berlin Congo Conference [Pg 606] of February 26, 1885, all the Powers which have possessions\nin the Congo district must grant complete freedom\nof commerce to all nations. Again, to give another example,\nFrance and Germany are by article 11 of the\nPeace of Frankfort of May 10, 1871, compelled to grant\none another most-favoured-nation treatment in their\ncommercial relations, in so far as favours which they\ngrant to Great Britain, Belgium, Holland, Switzerland,\nAustria, and Russia are concerned.",

The meaning\nof the term in International Law becomes apparent\nthrough its synonym cabotage —that is, navigation from\ncape to cape along the coast combined with trading\nbetween the ports of the coast concerned without going\nout into the Open Sea. Therefore, trade between Marseilles\nand Nice, between Calais and Havre, between\nLondon and Liverpool, and between Dublin and Belfast\nis coasting-trade, but trade between Marseilles and\nHavre, and between London and Dublin is not. It is a\nuniversally recognised rule [953] of International Law that\nevery littoral State can exclude foreign merchantmen\nfrom the cabotage within its maritime belt. Cabotage\nis the contrast to the over-sea [954] carrying trade, and has [Pg 607] nothing to do with the question of free trade from or\nto a port on the coast to or from a port abroad. This\nquestion is one of commercial policy, and International\nLaw does not prevent a State from restricting to\nvessels of its subjects the export from or the import\nto its ports, or from allowing such export or import\nunder certain conditions only.",

                                        "There is no doubt that originally the meaning of\ncoasting-trade in commercial treaties was identical with\nits meaning in International Law generally, but there\nis likewise no doubt that the practice of the States\ngives now a much more extended meaning to the term\ncoasting-trade as used in commercial treaties. Thus\nFrance distinguishes between cabotage petit and grand ;\nwhereas petit cabotage is coasting-trade between ports\nin the same sea, grand cabotage is coasting-trade between\na French port situated in the Atlantic Ocean and\na French port situated in the Mediterranean, and—according\nto a statute of September 21, 1793—both grand and petit cabotage are exclusively reserved for\nFrench vessels. Thus, further, the United States of\nAmerica has always considered trade between one of\nher ports in the Atlantic Ocean and one in the Pacific\nto be coasting-trade, and has exclusively reserved it for\nvessels of her own subjects; she considers such trade\ncoasting-trade even when the carriage takes place not\nexclusively by sea around Cape Horn, but partly by\nsea and partly by land through the Isthmus of Panama.\nGreat Britain has taken up a similar attitude. Section\n2 of the Navigation Act of 1849 (12 & 13 Vict. c. 29)\nenacted \"that no goods or passengers shall be carried coastwise from one part of the United Kingdom to another,\nor from the Isle of Man to the United Kingdom,\nexcept in British ships,\" and thereby declared trade\nbetween a port of England or Scotland to a port of Ireland\nor the Isle of Man to be coasting-trade exclusively [Pg 608] reserved for British ships in spite of the fact that the\nOpen Sea flows between these ports. And although\nthe Navigation Act of 1849 is no longer in force, and\nthis country now does admit foreign ships to its coasting-trade,\nit nevertheless still considers all trade between\none port of the United Kingdom and another to be\ncoasting-trade, as becomes apparent from Section 140\nof the Customs Laws Consolidation Act of July 24, 1876\n(39 & 40 Vict. c. 36). Again, Germany declared by a\nstatute of May 22, 1881, coasting-trade to be trade\nbetween any two German ports, and reserved it for\nGerman vessels, although vessels of such States can be admitted\nas on their part admit German vessels to their own\ncoasting-trade. Thus trade between Koenigsberg in the\nBaltic and Hamburg in the North Sea is coasting-trade.",
                                        "These instances are sufficient to demonstrate that\nan extension of the original meaning of coasting-trade\nhas really taken place and has found general recognition.\nA great many commercial treaties have been\nconcluded between such countries as established that\nextension of meaning and others, and these commercial\ntreaties no doubt make use of the term coasting-trade\nin this its extended meaning. It must, therefore, be\nmaintained that the term coasting-trade or cabotage as\nused in commercial treaties has acquired the following\nmeaning: Sea-trade between any two ports of the same\ncountry whether on the same coast or different coasts,\nprovided always that the different coasts are all of them\nthe coasts of one and the same country as a political and\ngeographical unit in contradistinction to the coasts of\nColonial dependencies of such country .",
                                        "In spite of this established extension of the term\ncoasting-trade, it did not include colonial trade until\nnearly the end of the nineteenth century. [955] Indeed, [Pg 609] when Russia, by ukase of 1897, enacted that trade\nbetween any of her ports should be considered coasting\ntrade and be reserved for Russian vessels, this did\nnot comprise a further extension of the conception\nof coasting-trade. The reason is that Russia, although\nher territory extends over different parts of the globe,\nis a political and geographical unit, and there is one\nstretch of territory only between St. Petersburg and\nVladivostock. But when, in 1898 and 1899, the United\nStates of America declared trade between any of her\nports and those of Porto Rico, the Philippines, and the\nHawaiian Islands to be coasting-trade, and consequently\nreserved it exclusively for American vessels,\nthe distinction between coasting-trade and over-sea or\ncolonial trade fell to the ground. It is submitted that\nthis American extension of the conception of coasting-trade\nas used in her commercial treaties before 1898 is\ninadmissible [956] and contains a violation of the treaty\nrights of the other contracting parties. Should these\nparties consent to the American extension of the meaning\nof coasting-trade, and should other countries follow\nthe American lead and apply the term coasting-trade\nindiscriminately to trade along their coasts and to\ntheir colonial trade, the meaning of the term would [Pg 610] then become trade between any two ports which are under\nthe sovereignty of the same State . The distinction between\ncoasting-trade and colonial trade would then\nbecome void, and the last trace of the synonymity between\ncoasting-trade and cabotage would have disappeared.",

This French statute does\nnot, as is frequently maintained, declare the trade between France and\nAlgeria to be coasting-trade, but it nevertheless reserves such trade\nexclusively for French vessels. The French Government, in bringing the\nbill before the French Parliament, explained that the statute could not\ncome into force before February 1, 1892, because art. 2 of the treaty\nwith Belgium of May 14, 1882, and art. 21 of the treaty with Spain of\nFebruary 6, 1882—both treaties to expire on February 1,\n1892—stipulated the same treatment for Belgian and Spanish as for\nFrench vessels, cabotage excepted . It is quite apparent that, if\nFrance had declared trade between French and Algerian ports to be\ncoasting-trade in the meaning of her commercial treaties, the expiration\nof the treaties with Belgium and Spain need not have been awaited for\nputting the law of April 2, 1889, into force.]",

According to the most-favoured-nation clause\nin its general form, all favours which either contracting\nparty has granted in the past or will grant in the future\nto any third State must be granted to the other party.\nBut the real meaning of this clause in its general form\nhas ever been controverted since the United States of\nAmerica entered into the Family of Nations and began\nto conclude commercial treaties embodying the clause.\nWhereas in former times the clause was considered\nobviously to have the effect of causing all favours\ngranted to any one State at once and unconditionally to accrue to all other States having most-favoured-nation\ntreaties with the grantor, the United States contended\nthat these favours could accrue to such of the\nother States only as fulfilled the same conditions under\nwhich these favours had been allowed to the grantee .\nThe majority of the commercial treaties of the United\nStates, therefore, do not contain the most-favoured-nation\nclause in its general form, but in what is called\nits conditional, qualified, or reciprocal, form. In this form\nit stipulates that all favours granted to third States shall\naccrue to the other party unconditionally, in case the\nfavours have been allowed unconditionally to the\ngrantee, but only under the same compensation, in case [Pg 611] they have been granted conditionally. The United\nStates, however, has always upheld the opinion, and\nthe supreme Court of the United States has confirmed [957] this interpretation, that, even if a commercial treaty\ncontains the clause in its general, and not in its qualified,\nform, it must always be interpreted as though it were\nworded in its qualified form.",
                                        "[Footnote 957: See\n Bartram v. Robertson, 122 United States 116, and\nWhitney v. Robertson, 124 United States 190.]",
                                        "Now nobody doubts that according to the qualified\nform of the clause a favour granted to any State can\nonly accrue to other States having most-favoured-nation\ntreaties with the grantor, provided they fulfil\nthe same conditions and offer the same compensations\nas the grantee. Again, nobody doubts that, if the\nclause is worded in its so-called unconditional form\nstipulating the accrument of a favour to other States\nwhether it was allowed to the grantee gratuitously or\nconditionally against compensation, all favours granted\nto any State accrue immediately and without condition\nto all the other States. However, as regards the clause\nin its general form, what might, broadly speaking, be\ncalled the European is confronted by the American\ninterpretation. This American interpretation is, I believe,\nunjustifiable, although it is of importance to\nmention that two European writers of such authority\nas Martens (II. p. 225) and Westlake (I. p. 283) approve\nof it.",
                                        "It has been suggested [958] that the controversy should\nbe brought before the Hague Court of Arbitration, yet\nthe United States will never consent to this. Those\nStates which complain of the American interpretation\nhad therefore better notify their commercial treaties\nwith the United States and insert in new treaties the\nmost-favoured-nation clause in such a form as puts\nmatters beyond all doubt. So much is certain, a State [Pg 612] that at present enters upon a commercial treaty with\nthe United States comprising the clause in its general\nform cannot complain [959] of the American interpretation,\nwhich, whatever may be its merits, is now a matter of\ncommon knowledge.

The development of international intercourse\nhas called into existence innumerable treaties for the\npurpose of satisfying economic and other non-political\ninterests of the several States. Each nation concludes\ntreaties of commerce, of navigation, of extradition,\nand of many other kinds with most of the other\nnations, and tries in this way, more or less successfully,\nto foster its own interests. Many of these interests\nare of such a particular character and depend upon such\nindividual circumstances and conditions that they can\nonly be satisfied and fostered by special treaties from\ntime to time concluded by each State with other States.\nYet experience has shown that the several States\nhave also many non-political interests in common\nwhich can better be satisfied and fostered by a general\ntreaty between a great number of States than by special [Pg 613] treaties singly concluded between the several parties.\nTherefore, since the second half of the nineteenth\ncentury, such general treaties have more and more come\ninto being, and it is certain that their number will in\ntime increase. Each of these treaties creates what is\ncalled a Union among the contracting parties, since\nthese parties have united for the purpose of settling\ncertain subjects in common. The number of States\nwhich are members of these Unions varies, of course,\nand whereas some of them will certainly become in\ntime universal in the same way as the Universal Postal\nUnion, others will never reach that stage.
