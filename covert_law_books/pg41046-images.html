<h2>
<span class="smaller">PREFACE</span>
<span class="x-small">TO THE SECOND EDITION</span>
</h2>
<p>The course of events since 1905, when this work first made its
appearance, and the results of further research have necessitated not
only the thorough revision of the former text and the rewriting of some
of its parts, but also the discussion of a number of new topics. But
while the new matter which has been incorporated has added considerably
to the length of the work—the additions to the bibliography, text, and
notes amounting to nearly a quarter of the former work—this second
edition is not less convenient in size than its predecessor. By
rearranging the matter on the page, using a line extra on each, and a
greater number of words on a line, by setting the bibliography and notes
in smaller type, and by omitting the Appendix, it has been found
possible to print the text of this new edition on 626 pages, as compared
with 594 pages of the first edition.</p>
<p>The system being elastic it was possible to place most of the additional
matter within the same sections and under the same headings as before.
Some of the points treated are, however, so entirely new that it was
necessary to deal with them under separate headings, and within separate
sections. The reader will easily distinguish them, since, to avoid
disturbing the arrangement of topics, these new sections have been
inserted between the old ones, and numbered as the sections preceding
them, but with the addition of the letters <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, &amp;c. The more
important of these new sections are the following:
 § <a href="#Apart_from_navigation178a" class="pginternal">178<i>a</i></a> (concerning
the Utilisation of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span> the
Flow of Rivers); §§ <a href="#To287a" class="pginternal">287<i>a</i></a> and <a href="#To_secure_radio287b" class="pginternal">287<i>b</i></a> (concerning Wireless
Telegraphy on the Open Sea); §§ <a href="#The_subsoil287c" class="pginternal">287<i>c</i></a> and <a href="#Since_there_is287d" class="pginternal">287<i>d</i></a> (concerning Mines and
Tunnels in the Subsoil of the Sea bed); § <a href="#Another_interesting446a" class="pginternal">446<i>a</i></a> (concerning the Casa
Blanca incident); §§ <a href="#The_International_Prize476a" class="pginternal">476<i>a</i></a> and <a href="#Va476b" class="pginternal">476<i>b</i></a> (concerning the International
Prize Court and the suggested International Court of Justice); §§ <a href="#The_Final_Act568a" class="pginternal">568<i>a</i></a>
and <a href="#The_Declaration568b" class="pginternal">568<i>b</i></a> (concerning the Conventions of the Second Hague Peace
Conference, and the Declaration of London); § <a href="#Different_from_real576a" class="pginternal">576<i>a</i></a> (concerning
Pseudo-Guarantees). Only towards the end of the volume has this mode of
dealing with the new topics been departed from. As the chapter treating
of Unions, the last of the volume, had to be entirely rearranged and
rewritten, and a new chapter on Commercial Treaties inserted, the old
arrangement comes to an end with § <a href="#Different_from_guarantee577" class="pginternal">577</a>; and §§ <a href="#Commercial_treaties578" class="pginternal">578</a> to <a href="#In_the_interest_of596" class="pginternal">596</a> of this new
edition present an arrangement of topics which differs from that of the
former edition.</p>
<p>I venture to hope that this edition will be received
as favourably as was its predecessor. My aim, as
always, has been to put the matter as clearly as possible
before the reader, and nowhere have I forgotten that
I am writing as a teacher for students. It is a matter
of great satisfaction to me that the prophetic warnings
of some otherwise very sympathetic reviewers that a
comprehensive treatise on International Law in two
volumes would never be read by young students have
proved mistaken. The numerous letters which I have
received from students, not only in this country but
also in America, Japan, France, and Italy, show that
I was not wrong when, in the preface to the former
edition, I described the work as an elementary book
for those beginning to study the subject. Many years
of teaching have confirmed me in the conviction that
those who approach the study of International Law
should at the outset be brought face to face with its
complicated problems, and should at once acquire a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
thorough understanding of the wide scope of the subject.
If writers and lecturers who aim at this goal will but
make efforts to use the clearest language and an elementary
method of explanation, they will attain success
in spite of the difficulty of the problems and the wide
range of topics to be considered.</p>
<p>I owe thanks to many reviewers and readers who
have drawn my attention to mistakes and misprints
in the first edition, and I am especially indebted to
Mr. C. J. B. Hurst, C.B., Assistant Legal Adviser to
the Foreign Office, to Mr. E. S. Roscoe, Admiralty
Registrar of the High Court, and to Messrs. F. Ritchie
and G. E. P. Hertslet of the Foreign Office who gave
me valuable information on certain points while I was
preparing the manuscript for this edition. And I must
likewise most gratefully mention Miss B. M. Rutter and
Mr. C. F. Pond who have assisted me in reading the
proofs and have prepared the table of cases and the
exhaustive alphabetical index.</p>

<p>§ 1. Law of Nations or International Law (<i>Droit des
gen</i>s, <i>Völkerrecht</i>) is the name for the body of customary
and conventional rules which are considered legally<a id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1_1">[1]</a>
binding by civilised States in their intercourse with
each other. Such part of these rules as is binding upon
all the civilised States without exception is called <i>universal</i>
International Law,<a id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_2_2">[2]</a> in contradistinction to <i>particular</i>
International Law, which is binding on two or a
few States only. But it is also necessary to distinguish
<i>general</i> International Law. This name must be given
to the body of such rules as are binding upon a great
many States, including leading Powers. General International
Law, as, for instance, the Declaration of Paris
of 1856, has a tendency to become universal International
Law.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>
<p>International Law in the meaning of the term as
used in modern times did not exist during antiquity
and the first part of the Middle Ages. It is in its origin
essentially a product of Christian civilisation, and began
gradually to grow from the second half of the Middle
Ages. But it owes its existence as a systematised
body of rules to the Dutch jurist and statesman Hugo
Grotius, whose work, "De Jure Belli ac Pacis libri III.,"
appeared in 1625 and became the foundation of all
later development.</p>
<p>The Law of Nations is a law for the intercourse of
States with one another, not a law for individuals. As,
however, there cannot be a sovereign authority above
the several sovereign States, the Law of Nations is a law
<i>between</i>, not above, the several States, and is, therefore,
since Bentham, also called "International Law."</p>
<p>Since the distinction of Bentham between International
Law public and private has been generally
accepted, it is necessary to emphasise that only the
so-called public International Law, which is identical
with the Law of Nations, is International Law, whereas
the so-called private International Law is not. The
latter concerns such matters as fall at the same time
under the jurisdiction of two or more different States.
And as the Municipal Laws of different States are
frequently in conflict with each other respecting such
matters, jurists belonging to different countries endeavour
to find a body of principles according to which
such conflicts can be avoided.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Legal
Force of
the Law of
Nations
contested.</p></div>
<p>§ 2. Almost from the beginning of the science of the
Law of Nations the question has been discussed whether
the rules of International Law are <i>legally</i> binding.
Hobbes<a id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_3_3">[3]</a> already and Pufendorf<a id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_4_4">[4]</a> had answered the
question in the negative. And during the nineteenth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
century Austin<a id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_5_5">[5]</a> and his followers take up the same
attitude. They define law as a body of rules for human
conduct set and enforced by a sovereign political authority.
If indeed this definition of law be correct, the
Law of Nations cannot be called law. For International
Law is a body of rules governing the relations
of Sovereign States between one another. And there
is not and cannot be a sovereign political authority
above the Sovereign States which could enforce such
rules. However, this definition of law is not correct.
It covers only the written or statute law within a State,
that part of the Municipal Law which is expressly made
by statutes of Parliament in a constitutional State or
by some other sovereign authority in a non-constitutional
State. It does not cover that part of Municipal
Law which is termed unwritten or customary law.
There is, in fact, no community and no State in the
world which could exist with written law only. Everywhere
there is customary law in existence besides the
written law. This customary law was never expressly
enacted by any law-giving body, or it would not be
merely customary law. Those who define law as rules
set and enforced by a sovereign political authority do
not deny the existence of customary law. But they
maintain that the customary law has the character of
law only through the indirect recognition on the part
of the State which is to be found in the fact that courts
of justice apply the customary in the same way as the
written law, and that the State does not prevent them
from doing so. This is, however, nothing else than a
fiction. Courts of justice having no law-giving power
could not recognise unwritten rules as law if these
rules were not law before that recognition, and States
recognise unwritten rules as law only because courts of
justice do so.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Characteristics
of
Rules of
Law.</p></div>
<p>§ 3. For the purpose of finding a correct definition
of law it is indispensable to compare morality and law
with each other, for both lay down rules, and to a great
extent the same rules, for human conduct. Now the
characteristic of rules of morality is that they apply to
conscience, and to conscience only. An act loses all
value before the tribunal of morality, if it was not done
out of free will and conscientiousness, but was enforced
by some external power or was done out of some consideration
which lies without the boundaries of conscience.
Thus, a man who gives money to the hospitals
in order that his name shall come before the public
does not act morally, and his deed is not a moral
one, though it appears to be one outwardly. On the
other hand, the characteristic of rules of law is that
they shall eventually be enforced by external power.<a id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_6_6">[6]</a>
Rules of law apply, of course, to conscience quite as
much as rules of morality. But the latter require to
be enforced by the internal power of conscience only,
whereas the former require to be enforced by some
external power. When, to give an illustrative example,
morality commands you to pay your debts, it hopes
that your conscience will make you pay them. On the
other hand, if the law gives the same command, it
hopes that, if the conscience has not sufficient power to
make you pay your debts, the fact that, if you will not
pay, the bailiff will come into your house, will do so.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> Westlake, Chapters, p. 12,
 seems
to make the same distinction between
rules of law and of morality,
and Twiss, I. § 105, adopts it <i>expressis
verbis</i>.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Law-giving Authority not essential for the Existence of Law.</p></div>
<p>§ 4. If these are the characteristic signs of morality
and of law, we are justified in stating the principle:
A rule is a rule of morality, if by common consent of
the community it applies to conscience and to conscience
only; whereas, on the other hand, a rule is a
rule of law, if by common consent of the community it
shall eventually be enforced by external power. Without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
some kind both of morality and law, no community
has ever existed or could possibly exist. But there
need not be, at least not among primitive communities,
a law-giving authority within a community. Just as
the rules of morality are growing through the influence
of many different factors, so the law can grow without
being expressly laid down and set by a law-giving
authority. Wherever we have an opportunity of
observing a primitive community, we find that some
of its rules for human conduct apply to conscience
only, whereas others shall by common consent of the
community be enforced; the former are rules of morality
only, whereas the latter are rules of law. For the
existence of law neither a law-giving authority nor
courts of justice are essential. Whenever a question of
law arises in a primitive community, it is the community
itself and not a court which decides it. Of
course, when a community is growing out of the primitive
condition of its existence and becomes gradually
so enlarged that it turns into a State in the sense
proper of the term, the necessities of life and altered
circumstances of existence do not allow the community
itself any longer to do anything and everything. And
the law can now no longer be left entirely in the hands
of the different factors which make it grow gradually
from case to case. A law-giving authority is now just
as much wanted as a governing authority. It is for
this reason that we find in every State a Legislature,
which makes laws, and courts of justice, which administer
them.</p>
<p>However, if we ask whence does the power of the
legislature to make laws come, there is no other
answer than this: From the common consent of the
community. Thus, in Great Britain, Parliament is
the law-making body by common consent. An Act
of Parliament is law, because the common consent of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
Great Britain is behind it. That Parliament has law-making
authority is law itself, but unwritten and
customary law. <i>Thus the very important fact comes to
light that all statute or written law is based on unwritten
law in so far as the power of Parliament to make Statute
Law is given to Parliament by unwritten law.</i> It is the
common consent of the British people that Parliament
shall have the power of making rules which shall be
enforced by external power. But besides the statute
laws made by Parliament there exist and are constantly
growing other laws, unwritten or customary, which are
day by day recognised through courts of justice.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Definition
and three
Essential
Conditions
of
Law.</p></div>
<p>§ 5. <a id="On_the_basis_of5"></a>On the basis of the results of these previous
investigations we are now able to give a definition of
law. We may say that <i>law is a body of rules for human
conduct within a community which by common consent of
this community shall be enforced by external power</i>.</p>
<p>The essential conditions of the existence of law are,
therefore, threefold. There must, first, be a community.
There must, secondly, be a body of rules for
human conduct within that community. And there
must, thirdly, be a common consent of that community
that these rules shall be enforced by external power.
It is not an essential condition either that such rules
of conduct must be written rules, or that there should
be a law-making authority or a law-administering court
within the community concerned. And it is evident
that, if we find this definition of law correct, and accept
these three essential conditions of law, the existence of
law is not limited to the State community only, but is
to be found everywhere where there is a community.
The best example of the existence of law outside the
State is the law of the Roman Catholic Church, the so-called
Canon Law. This Church is an organised community
whose members are dispersed over the whole
surface of the earth. They consider themselves bound<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
by the rules of the Canon Law, although there is no
sovereign political authority that sets and enforces
those rules, the Pope and the bishops and priests being
a religious authority only. But there is an external
power through which the rules of the Canon Law are
enforced—namely, the punishments of the Canon Law,
such as excommunication, refusal of sacraments, and
the like. And the rules of the Canon Law are in this
way enforced by common consent of the whole Roman
Catholic community.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Law not
to be identified
with
Municipal
Law.</p></div>
<p>§ 6. But it must be emphasised that, if there is law
to be found in every community, law in this meaning
must not be identified with the law of States, the so-called
Municipal Law,<a id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_7_7">[7]</a> just as the conception of State
must not be identified with the conception of community.
The conception of community is a wider one
than the conception of State. A State is a community,
but not every community is a State. Likewise the
conception of law pure and simple is a wider one than
that of Municipal Law. Municipal Law is law, but not
every law is Municipal Law, as, for instance, the Canon
Law is not. Municipal Law is a narrower conception
than law pure and simple. The body of rules which
is called the Law of Nations might, therefore, be law
in the strict sense of the term, although it might not
possess the characteristics of Municipal Law. To make
sure whether the Law of Nations is or is not law, we
have to inquire whether the three essential conditions
of the existence of law are to be found in the Law of
Nations.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> Throughout this work the term "Municipal Law" is made use
of in the sense of national or State law in contradistinction to
International Law.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>The
"Family

Community.</p></div>
<p>§ 7. As the first condition is the existence of a community,
the question arises, whether an international
community exists whose law could be the Law of
Nations. Before this question can be answered, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
conception of community must be defined. A community
may be said to be the body of a number of
individuals more or less bound together through such
common interests as create a constant and manifold
intercourse between the single individuals. This definition
of community covers not only a community of
individual men, but also a community of individual
communities such as individual States. A Confederation
of States is a community of States. But is there
a universal international community of all individual
States in existence? This question is decidedly to be
answered in the affirmative as far as the States of the
civilised world are concerned. Innumerable are the
interests which knit all the individual civilised States
together and which create constant intercourse between
these States as well as between their subjects. As the
civilised States are, with only a few exceptions, Christian
States, there are already religious ideas which wind a
band around them. There are, further, science and
art, which are by their nature to a great extent international,
and which create a constant exchange of ideas
and opinions between the subjects of the several
States. Of the greatest importance are, however,
agriculture, industry, and trade. It is totally impossible
even for the largest empire to produce everything its
subjects want. Therefore, the productions of agriculture
and industry must be exchanged by the several
States, and it is for this reason that international
trade is an unequalled factor for the welfare of
every civilised State. Even in antiquity, when every
State tried to be a world in itself, States did not
and could not exist without some sort of international
trade. It is international trade which has created
navigation on the high seas and on the rivers flowing
through different States. It is, again, international
trade which has called into existence the nets of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
railways which cover the continents, the international
postal and telegraphic arrangements, and the Transatlantic
telegraphic cables.<a id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_8_8">[8]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> See
 Fried, "Das internationale Leben der Gegenwart" (1908),
where the innumerable interests are grouped and discussed which knit the
civilised world together.</p></div>
<p>The manifold interests which knit all the civilised
States together and create a constant intercourse between
one another, have long since brought about the
necessity that these States should have one or more
official representatives living abroad. Thus we find
everywhere foreign envoys and consuls. They are the
agents who make possible the current stream of transactions
between the Governments of the different
States. A number of International Offices, International
Bureaux, International Commissions have been
permanently appointed for the administration of international
business, a permanent Court of Arbitration
has been, and an International Prize Court will soon
be, established at the Hague. And from time to time
special international conferences and congresses of delegates
of the different States are convoked for discussing
and settling matters international. Though the individual
States are sovereign and independent of each
other, though there is no international Government
above the national ones, though there is no central
political authority to which the different States are
subjected, yet there is something mightier than all the
powerful separating factors: namely, the common interests.
And these common interests and the necessary
intercourse which serves these interests, unite the
separate States into an indivisible community. For
many hundreds of years this community has been called
"Family of Nations" or "Society of Nations."</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>The "Family of Nations" a Community with Rules of Conduct.</p></div>
<p>§ 8. Thus the first essential condition for the existence
of law is a reality. The single States make altogether
a body of States, a community of individual<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
States. But the second condition cannot be denied
either. For hundreds of years more and more rules
have grown up for the conduct of the States between
each other. These rules are to a great extent customary
rules. But side by side with these customary and unwritten
rules more and more written rules are daily
created by international agreements, such as the
Declaration of Paris of 1856, the Hague Rules concerning
land warfare of 1899 and 1907, and the like. The
so-called Law of Nations is nothing else than a body of
customary and conventional rules regulating the conduct
of the individual States with each other. Just as
out of tribal communities which were in no way connected
with each other arose the State, so the Family
of Nations arose out of the different States which were
in no way connected with each other. But whereas
the State is a settled institution, firmly established and
completely organised, the Family of Nations is still in
the beginning of its development. A settled institution
and firmly established it certainly is, but it entirely
lacks at present any organisation whatever. Such an
organisation is, however, gradually growing into existence
before our eyes. The permanent Court of Arbitration
created by the First Hague Peace Conference,
and the International Prize Court proposed by the
Second Hague Peace Conference, are the first small
traces of a future organisation. The next step forward
will be that the Hague Peace Conferences will meet
automatically within certain periods of time, without
being summoned by one of the Powers. A second step
forward will be the agreement on the part of the Powers
upon fixed rules of procedure for the future Hague
Peace Conferences. As soon as these two steps forward
are really made, the nucleus of an organisation of the
Family of Nations will be in existence, and out of this
nucleus will grow in time a more powerful organisation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>

<div class="sidenote"><p>External
Power for
the Enforcement
of Rules of
International
Conduct.</p></div>
<p>§ 9. <a id="But_how9"></a>But how do matters stand concerning the third
essential condition for the existence of law? Is there a
common consent of the community of States that the
rules of international conduct shall be enforced by
external power? There cannot be the slightest doubt
that this question must be affirmatively answered,
although there is no central authority to enforce those
rules. The heads of the civilised States, their Governments,
their Parliaments, and public opinion of the
whole of civilised humanity, agree and consent that the
body of rules of international conduct which is called
the Law of Nations shall be enforced by external power,
in contradistinction to rules of international morality
and courtesy, which are left to the consideration of the
conscience of nations. And in the necessary absence of
a central authority for the enforcement of the rules of
the Law of Nations, the States have to take the law
into their own hands. Self-help and intervention on
the part of other States which sympathise with the
wronged one are the means by which the rules of the
Law of Nations can be<a id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_10_10">[10]</a> and actually are enforced. It
is true that these means have many disadvantages,
but they are means which have the character of external
power. Compared with Municipal Law and the means
at disposal for its enforcement, the Law of Nations is
certainly the weaker of the two. A law is the stronger,
the more guarantees are given that it can and will be
enforced. Thus, the law of a State which is governed
by an uncorrupt Government and the courts of which
are not venal is stronger than the law of a State which
has a corrupt Government and venal judges. It is
inevitable that the Law of Nations must be a weaker<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
law than Municipal Law, as there is not and cannot be
an international Government above the national ones
which could enforce the rules of International Law in
the same way as a national Government enforces the
rules of its Municipal Law. But a weak law is nevertheless
still law, and the Law of Nations is by no means
so weak a law as it sometimes seems to be.<a id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_11_11">[11]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_10_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_10" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> See

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_11_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_11" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> Those who deny to International Law the character of law
because they identify the conception of law in general with that of
Municipal Law and because they cannot see any law outside the State,
confound cause and effect. Originally law was not a product of the
State, but the State was a product of law. The right of the State to
make law is based upon the rule of law that the State is competent to
make law.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Practice
recognises
Law of
Nations as
Law.</p></div>
<p>§ 10. The fact is that theorists only are divided
concerning the character of the Law of Nations as real
law. In practice International Law is constantly recognised
as law. The Governments and Parliaments of
the different States are of opinion that they are legally,
not morally only, bound by the Law of Nations,
although they cannot be forced to go before a court in
case they are accused of having violated it. Likewise,
public opinion of all civilised States considers every
State legally bound to comply with the rules of the Law
of Nations, not taking notice of the opinion of those
theorists who maintain that the Law of Nations does
not bear the character of real law. And the several
States not only recognise the rules of International
Law as legally binding in innumerable treaties, but
emphasise every day the fact that there is a law between
themselves. They moreover recognise this law
by their Municipal Laws ordering their officials, their
civil and criminal courts, and their subjects to take up
such an attitude as is in conformity with the duties
imposed upon their Sovereign by the Law of Nations.
If a violation of the Law of Nations occurs on the part
of an individual State, public opinion of the civilised
world, as well as the Governments of other States,
stigmatise such violation as a violation of law pure and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
simple. And countless treaties concerning trade, navigation,
post, telegraph, copyright, extradition, and
many other objects exist between civilised States,
which treaties, resting entirely on the existence of a law
between the States, presuppose such a law, and contribute
by their very existence to its development and
growth.</p>
<p>Violations of this law are certainly frequent. But
the offenders always try to prove that their acts do
not contain a violation, and that they have a right to
act as they do according to the Law of Nations, or at
least that no rule of the Law of Nations is against their
acts. Has a State ever confessed that it was going to
break the Law of Nations or that it ever did so? The
fact is that States, in breaking the Law of Nations,
never deny its existence, but recognise its existence
through the endeavour to interpret the Law of Nations
in a way favourable to their act. And there is an
ever-growing tendency to bring disputed questions of
International Law as well as international differences
in general before international courts. The permanent
Court of Arbitration at the Hague established in 1899,
and the International Prize Court proposed at the
Hague according to a convention of 1907, are the first
promising fruits of this tendency.</p>

<span class="larger">II</span>
<span class="smaller">BASIS OF THE LAW OF NATIONS</span>
</h4>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Common
Consent
the Basis
of Law.</p></div>
<p>§ 11. If law is, as defined above (§ 5), a body of
rules for human conduct within a community which by
common consent of this community shall be enforced
through external power, common consent is the basis
of all law. What, now, does the term "common consent"
mean? If it meant that all the individuals who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
are members of a community must at every moment
of their existence expressly consent to every point of
law, such common consent would never be a fact. The
individuals, who are the members of a community, are
successively born into it, grow into it together with
the growth of their intellect during adolescence, and die
away successively to make room for others. The community
remains unaltered, although a constant change
takes place in its members. "Common consent" can
therefore only mean the express or tacit consent of
such an overwhelming majority of the members that
those who dissent are of no importance whatever, and
disappear totally from the view of one who looks for the
will of the community as an entity in contradistinction
to the wills of its single members. The question as to
whether there be such a common consent in a special
case, is not a question of theory, but of fact only. It
is a matter of observation and appreciation, and not of
logical and mathematical decision, just as is the well-known
question, how many grains make a heap?
Those legal rules which come down from ancestors to
their descendants remain law so long only as they are
supported by common consent of these descendants.
New rules can only become law if they find common
consent on the part of those who constitute the community
at the time. It is for that reason that custom
is at the background of all law, whether written or
unwritten.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Common
Consent
of the
Family of
Nations
the Basis
of International
Law.</p></div>
<p>§ 12. <a id="Wh12"></a>What has been stated with regard to law pure
and simple applies also to the Law of Nations. However,
the community for which this Law of Nations is
authoritative consists not of individual human beings,
but of individual States. And whereas in communities
consisting of individual human beings there is a constant
and gradual change of the members through birth,
death, emigration, and immigration, the Family of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
Nations is a community within which no such constant
change takes place, although now and then a member
disappears and a new member steps in. The members
of the Family of Nations are therefore not born into
that community and they do not grow into it. New
members are simply received into it through express or
tacit recognition. It is therefore necessary to scrutinise
more closely the common consent of the States which
is the basis of the Law of Nations.</p>
<p>The customary rules of this law have grown up by
common consent of the States—that is, the different
States have acted in such a manner as includes their
tacit consent to these rules. As far as the process of
the growth of a usage and its turning into a custom
can be traced back, customary rules of the Law of
Nations came into existence in the following way. The
intercourse of States with each other necessitated some
rules of international conduct. Single usages, therefore,
gradually grew up, the different States acting in
the same or in a similar way when an occasion arose.
As some rules of international conduct were from the
end of the Middle Ages urgently wanted, the theory of
the Law of Nations prepared the ground for their
growth by constructing certain rules on the basis of
religious, moral, rational, and historical reflections.
Hugo Grotius's work, "De Jure Belli ac Pacis libri III."
(1625), offered a systematised body of rules, which
recommended themselves so much to the needs and
wants of the time that they became the basis of the
development following. Without the conviction of the
Governments and of public opinion of the civilised
States that there ought to be legally binding rules for
international conduct, on the one hand, and, on the
other hand, without the pressure exercised upon the
States by their interests and the necessity for the
growth of such rules, the latter would never have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
grown up. When afterwards, especially in the nineteenth
century, it became apparent that customs and
usages alone were not sufficient or not sufficiently clear,
new rules were created through law-making treaties
being concluded which laid down rules for future international
conduct. Thus conventional rules gradually
grew up side by side with customary rules.</p>
<p>New States which came into existence and were
through express or tacit recognition admitted into the
Family of Nations thereby consented to the body of
rules for international conduct in force at the time of
their admittance. It is therefore not necessary to prove
for every single rule of International Law that every
single member of the Family of Nations consented to
it. No single State can say on its admittance into the
Family of Nations that it desires to be subjected to
such and such a rule of International Law, and not to
others. The admittance includes the duty to submit
to all the rules in force, with the sole exception of those
which, such as the rules of the Geneva Convention
for instance, are specially stipulated for such States
only as have concluded, or later on acceded to,
a certain international treaty creating the rules
concerned.</p>
<p>On the other hand, no State which is a member of
the Family of Nations can at some time or another
declare that it will in future no longer submit to a
certain recognised rule of the Law of Nations. The
body of the rules of this law can be altered by common
consent only, not by a unilateral declaration on the
part of one State. This applies not only to customary
rules, but also to such conventional rules as have been
called into existence through a law-making treaty for
the purpose of creating a permanent mode of future
international conduct without a right of the signatory
powers to give notice of withdrawal. It would, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
instance, be a violation of International Law on the
part of a signatory Power of the Declaration of Paris
of 1856 to declare that it would cease to be a party.
But it must be emphasised that this does not apply to
such conventional rules as are stipulated by a law-making
treaty which expressly reserves the right to the
signatory Powers to give notice.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>States the
Subjects
of the
Law of
Nations.</p></div>
<p>§ 13. <a id="Since_the_Law_of13"></a>Since the Law of Nations is based on the
common consent of individual States, and not of individual
human beings, States solely and exclusively are
the subjects of International Law. This means that
the Law of Nations is a law for the international conduct
of States, and not of their citizens. Subjects of the
rights and duties arising from the Law of Nations are
States solely and exclusively. An individual human
being, such as a king or an ambassador for example, is
never directly a subject of International Law. Therefore,
all rights which might necessarily have to be
granted to an individual human being according to the
Law of Nations are not international rights, but rights
granted by Municipal Law in accordance with a duty
imposed upon the respective State by International
Law. Likewise, all duties which might necessarily have
to be imposed upon individual human beings according
to the Law of Nations are not international duties, but
duties imposed by Municipal Law in accordance with
a right granted to or a duty imposed upon the respective
State by International Law. Thus the privileges
of an ambassador are granted to him by the
Municipal Law of the State to which he is accredited,
but such State has the duty to grant these privileges
according to International Law. Thus, further, the
duties incumbent upon officials and subjects of neutral
States in time of war are imposed upon them by the
Municipal Law of their home States, but these States
have, according to International Law, the duty of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
imposing the respective duties upon their officials and
citizens.<a id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_12_12">[12]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_12_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_12" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> The importance of the fact that subjects of the Law of
Nations are States exclusively is so great that I consider it necessary
to emphasise it again and again throughout this work. See, for instance,

that this assertion is even nowadays still sometimes contradicted; see,

<div class="sidenote"><p>Source in
Contradistinction
to
Cause.</p></div>
<p>§ 15. The different writers on the Law of Nations
disagree widely with regard to kinds and numbers of
sources of this law. The fact is that the term "source
of law" is made use of in different meanings by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
different writers on International Law, as on law in
general. It seems to me that most writers confound
the conception of "source" with that of "cause," and
through this mistake come to a standpoint from which
certain factors which influence the growth of International
Law appear as sources of rules of the Law of
Nations. This mistake can be avoided by going back
to the meaning of the term "source" in general.
Source means a spring or well, and has to be defined
as the rising from the ground of a stream of water.
When we see a stream of water and want to know
whence it comes, we follow the stream upwards until
we come to the spot where it rises naturally from the
ground. On that spot, we say, is the source of the
stream of water. We know very well that this source
is not the cause of the existence of the stream of water.
Source signifies only the natural rising of water from a
certain spot of the ground, whatever natural causes
there may be for that rising. If we apply the conception
of source in this meaning to the term "source of
law," the confusion of source with cause cannot arise.
Just as we see streams of water running over the
surface of the earth, so we see, as it were, streams of
rules running over the area of law. And if we want to
know whence these rules come, we have to follow these
streams upwards until we come to their beginning.
Where we find that such rules rise into existence, there
is the source of them. Of course, rules of law do not
rise from a spot on the ground as water does; they
rise from facts in the historical development of a community.
Thus in Great Britain a good many rules
of law rise every year from Acts of Parliament.
"Source of Law" is therefore the name for an historical
fact out of which rules of conduct rise into existence
and legal force.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>The two Sources of International Law.</p></div>
<p>§ 16. As the basis of the Law of Nations is the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
common consent of the member States of the Family
of Nations, it is evident that there must exist, and can
only exist, as many sources of International Law as
there are facts through which such common consent
can possibly come into existence. Of such facts there
are only two. A State, just as an individual, may give
its consent either directly by an express declaration or
tacitly by conduct which it would not follow in case
it did not consent. The sources of International Law
are therefore twofold—namely: (1) <i>express</i> consent,
which is given when States conclude a treaty stipulating
certain rules for the future international conduct
of the parties; (2) <i>tacit</i> consent, which is given through
States having adopted the custom of submitting to
certain rules of international conduct. Treaties and
custom are, therefore, exclusively the sources of the
Law of Nations.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Custom in
Contradistinction
to
Usage.</p></div>
<p>§ 17. <a id="Cu17"></a>Custom is the older and the original source of
International Law in particular as well as of law in
general. Custom must not be confounded with usage.
In everyday life and language both terms are used
synonymously, but in the language of the jurist they
have two distinctly different meanings. Jurists speak
of a custom, when a clear and continuous habit of
doing certain actions has grown up under the ægis of
the conviction that these actions are legally necessary
or legally right. On the other hand, jurists speak of a
usage, when a habit of doing certain actions has grown
up without there being the conviction of their legal
character. Thus the term "custom" is in juristic
language a narrower conception than the term "usage,"
as a given course of conduct may be usual without being
customary. Certain conduct of States concerning their
international relations may therefore be usual without
being the outcome of customary International Law.</p>
<p>As usages have a tendency to become custom, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
question presents itself, at what time a usage turns
into a custom. This question is one of fact, not of
theory. All that theory can point out is this: Wherever
and as soon as a frequently adopted international conduct
of States is considered legally necessary or legally
right, the rule which may be abstracted from such
conduct, is a rule of customary International Law.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Treaties
as Source
of International
Law.</p></div>
<p>§ 18. <a id="Treaties_are18"></a>Treaties are the second source of International
Law, and a source which has of late become of the
greatest importance. As treaties may be concluded for
innumerable purposes,<a id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_14_14">[14]</a> it is necessary to emphasise that
such treaties only are a source of International Law as
either stipulate new rules for future international conduct
or confirm, define, or abolish existing customary
or conventional rules. Such treaties must be called
<i>law-making treaties</i>. Since the Family of Nations is not
a State-like community, there is no central authority
which could make law for it in a similar way as
Parliaments make law by statutes within the States.
The only way in which International Law can be made
by a deliberate act, in contradistinction to custom, is
that the members of the Family of Nations conclude
treaties in which certain rules for their future conduct
are stipulated. Of course, such law-making treaties
create law for the contracting parties solely. Their
law is <i>universal</i> International Law then only, when all
the members of the Family of Nations are parties to
them. Many law-making treaties are concluded by a
few States only, so that the law which they create is
<i>particular</i> International Law. On the other hand,
there have been many law-making treaties concluded
which contain <i>general</i> International Law, because the
majority of States, including leading Powers, are parties
to them. General International Law has a tendency
to become universal because such States as hitherto did<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
not consent to it will in future either expressly give
their consent or recognise the respective rules tacitly
through custom.<a id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_15_15">[15]</a> But it must be emphasised that,
whereas custom is the original source of International
Law, treaties are a source the power of which derives
from custom. For the fact that treaties can stipulate
rules of international conduct at all is based on the
customary rule of the Law of Nations, that treaties are
binding upon the contracting parties.<a id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_16_16">[16]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Factors
influencing the Growth
of International Law.</p></div>
<p>§ 19. <a id="Thus_custom19"></a>Thus custom and treaties are the two exclusive
sources of the Law of Nations. When writers on
International Law frequently enumerate other sources
besides custom and treaties, they confound the term
"source" with that of "cause" by calling sources of
International Law such factors as influence the gradual
growth of new rules of International Law without,
however, being the historical facts from which these
rules receive their legal force. Important factors of
this kind are: Opinions of famous writers<a id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_17_17">[17]</a> on International
Law, decisions of prize courts, arbitral awards,<a id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_18_18">[18]</a>
instructions issued by the different States for the
guidance of their diplomatic and other organs, State
Papers concerning foreign politics, certain Municipal
Laws, decisions of Municipal Courts.<a id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_19_19">[19]</a> All these and
other factors may influence the growth of International
Law either by creating usages which gradually turn
into custom, or by inducing the members of the Family
of Nations to conclude such treaties as stipulate legal
rules for future international conduct.</p>

<p>A factor of a special kind which also influences the
growth of International Law is the so-called <i>Comity</i>
(<i>Comitas Gentium</i>, <i>Convenance et Courtoisie Internationale</i>, <i>Staatengunst</i>).<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
In their intercourse with one another,
States do observe not only legally binding rules and
such rules as have the character of usages, but also
rules of politeness, convenience, and goodwill. Such
rules of international conduct are not rules of law, but
of comity. The Comity of Nations is certainly not a
source of International Law, as it is distinctly the
contrast to the Law of Nations. But there can be no
doubt that many a rule which formerly was a rule of
International Comity only is nowadays a rule of International
Law. And it is certainly to be expected that
this development will go on in future also, and that
thereby many a rule of present International Comity
will in future become one of International Law.<a id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_20_20">[20]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_20_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor_20_20" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[20]</span></a> The matter is ably discussed in Stoerk, "Völkerrecht und Völkercourtoisie"
(1908).</p></div>
<p>Not to be confounded with the rules of Comity are
the rules of morality which ought to apply to the
intercourse of States as much as to the intercourse of
individuals.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Essential
Difference
between
International
and Municipal
Law.</p></div>
<p>§ 20. <a id="Th20"></a>The Law of Nations and the Municipal Law
of the single States are essentially different from each
other. They differ, first, as regards their sources.
Sources of Municipal Law are custom grown up within
the boundaries of the respective State and statutes
enacted by the law-giving authority. Sources of International
Law are custom grown up within the Family<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
of Nations and law-making treaties concluded by the
members of that family.</p>
<p>The Law of Nations and Municipal Law differ,
secondly, regarding the relations they regulate. Municipal
Law regulates relations between the individuals
under the sway of the respective State and the relations
between this State and the respective individuals.
International Law, on the other hand, regulates relations
between the member States of the Family of
Nations.</p>
<p>The Law of Nations and Municipal Law differ,
thirdly, with regard to the substance of their law:
whereas Municipal Law is a law of a Sovereign over
individuals subjected to his sway, the Law of Nations
is a law not above, but between Sovereign States, and
therefore a weaker law.<a id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_21_21">[21]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_21_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21_21" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> See

<div class="sidenote"><p>Law of
Nations
never <i>per
se</i> Municipal
Law.</p></div>
<p>§ 21. <a id="If_the_Law21"></a>If the Law of Nations and Municipal Law
differ as demonstrated, the Law of Nations can neither
as a body nor in parts be <i>per se</i> a part of Municipal
Law. Just as Municipal Law lacks the power of altering
or creating rules of International Law, so the latter
lacks absolutely the power of altering or creating rules
of Municipal Law. If, according to the Municipal Law
of an individual State, the Law of Nations as a body
or in parts is considered the law of the land, this can
only be so either by municipal custom or by statute,
and then the respective rules of the Law of Nations
have by adoption<a id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_22_22">[22]</a> become at the same time rules of
Municipal Law. Wherever and whenever such total or
partial adoption has not taken place, municipal courts
cannot be considered to be bound by International<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
Law, because it has, <i>per se</i>, no power over municipal
courts.<a id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_23_23">[23]</a> And if it happens that a rule of Municipal
Law is in indubitable conflict with a rule of the Law
of Nations, municipal courts must apply the former.
If, on the other hand, a rule of the Law of Nations
regulates a fact without conflicting with, but without
expressly or tacitly having been adopted by Municipal
Law, municipal courts cannot apply such rule of the
Law of Nations.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_22_22"></a><a href="#FNanchor_22_22" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[22]</span></a> This has been done by the United
States. See The Nereide, 9 Cranch,

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_23_23"></a><a href="#FNanchor_23_23" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[23]</span></a> This ought to be generally recognised,
but, in fact, is not; says, for instance,
Kohler in Z.V. II.(1908), p. 210:—"<i>...
das Völkerrecht ist ein überstaatliches
Recht, das der Gesetzgebung
des einzelnen Staates nicht unterworfen
ist und von den Richtern ohne weiteres
respectirt werden muss: das Völkerrecht
steht über dem staatlichen Recht</i>."</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Certain Rules of Municipal Law necessitated or interdicted.</p></div>
<p>§ 22. If Municipal Courts cannot apply unadopted
rules of the Law of Nations, and must apply even such
rules of Municipal Law as conflict with the Law of
Nations, it is evident that the several States, in order
to fulfil their international obligations, are compelled
to possess certain rules, and are prevented from having
certain other rules as part of their Municipal Law. It
is not necessary to enumerate all the rules of Municipal
Law which a State must possess, and all those rules it
is prevented from having. It suffices to give some
illustrative examples. Thus, on the one hand, the
Municipal Law of every State, for instance, is compelled
to possess rules granting the necessary privileges
to foreign diplomatic envoys, protecting the life and
liberty of foreign citizens residing on its territory,
threatening punishment for certain acts committed on
its territory in violation of a foreign State. On the
other hand, the Municipal Law of every State is prevented
by the Law of Nations from having rules, for
instance, conflicting with the freedom of the high seas,
or prohibiting the innocent passage of foreign merchantmen
through its maritime belt, or refusing justice
to foreign residents with regard to injuries committed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
on its territory to their lives, liberty, and property by
its own citizens. If a State does nevertheless possess
such rules of Municipal Law as it is prevented from
having by the Law of Nations, or if it does not possess
such Municipal rules as it is compelled to have by the
Law of Nations, it violates an international legal duty,
but its courts<a id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_24_24">[24]</a> cannot by themselves alter the Municipal
Law to meet the requirements of the Law of
Nations.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_24_24"></a><a href="#FNanchor_24_24" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[24]</span></a> This became quite apparent in the Moray Firth case
(Mortensen <i>v.</i> Peters)—see
 below, § <a href="#Gulfs_and_bays192" class="pginternal">192</a>—in which the Court had to
apply British Municipal Law.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Presumption against conflicts between International and
Municipal Law.</p></div>
<p>§ 23. However, although Municipal Courts must apply Municipal Law even
if conflicting with the Law of Nations, there is a presumption against
the existence of such a conflict. As the Law of Nations is based upon
the common consent of the different States, it is improbable that a
civilised State would intentionally enact a rule conflicting with the
Law of Nations. A part of Municipal Law, which ostensibly seems to
conflict with the Law of Nations, must, therefore, if possible, always
be so interpreted as essentially not containing such conflict.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Presumption
of
Existence
of certain
necessary
Municipal
Rules.</p></div>
<p>§ 24. In case of a gap in the statutes of a civilised
State regarding certain rules necessitated by the Law
of Nations, such rules ought to be presumed by the
Courts to have been tacitly adopted by such Municipal
Law. It may be taken for granted that a State
which is a member of the Family of Nations does not
intentionally want its Municipal Law to be deficient in
such rules. If, for instance, the Municipal Law of a
State does not by a statute grant the necessary privileges
to diplomatic envoys, the courts ought to presume
that such privileges are tacitly granted.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Presumption of the Existence of certain Municipal Rules in
Conformity with Rights granted by the Law of Nations.</p></div>
<p>§ 25. <a id="There_is_no_doubt25"></a>There is no doubt that a State need not make
use of all the rights it has by the Law of Nations, and
that, consequently, every State can by its laws expressly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
renounce the whole or partial use of such rights,
provided always it is ready to fulfil such duties, if any,
as are connected with these rights. However, when no
such renunciation has taken place, Municipal Courts
ought, in case the interests of justice demand it, to
presume that their Sovereign has tacitly consented to
make use of such rights. If, for instance, the Municipal
Law of a State does not by a statute extend its
jurisdiction over its maritime belt, its courts ought to
presume that, since by the Law of Nations the jurisdiction
of a State does extend over its maritime belt,
their Sovereign has tacitly consented to that wider
range of its jurisdiction.</p>
<p>A remarkable case illustrating this happened in this
country in 1876. The German vessel <i>Franconia</i>, while
passing through the British maritime belt within three
miles of Dover, negligently ran into the British vessel
<i>Strathclyde</i>, and sank her. As a passenger on board the
latter was thereby drowned, the commander of the
<i>Franconia</i>, the German Keyn, was indicted at the
Central Criminal Court and found guilty of manslaughter.
The Court for Crown Cases Reserved, however,
to which the Central Criminal Court referred the
question of jurisdiction, held by a majority of one
judge that, according to the law of the land, English
courts had no jurisdiction over crimes committed in
the English maritime belt. Keyn was therefore not
punished.<a id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_25_25">[25]</a> To provide for future cases of like kind,
Parliament passed, in 1878, the "Territorial Waters

<div class="sidenote"><p>Range of
Dominion
of International
Law controversial.</p></div>
<p>§ 26. Dominion of the Law of Nations is the name
given to the area within which International Law is
applicable—that is, those States between which International
Law finds validity. The range of the dominion
of the Law of Nations is controversial, two extreme
opinions concerning this dominion being opposed. Some
publicists<a id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_27_27">[27]</a> maintain that the dominion of the Law of
Nations extends as far as humanity itself, that every
State, whether Christian or non-Christian, civilised or
uncivilised, is a subject of International Law. On the
other hand, several jurists<a id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_28_28">[28]</a> teach that the dominion of
the Law of Nations extends only as far as Christian
civilisation, and that Christian States only are subjects
of International Law. Neither of these opinions would
seem to be in conformity with the facts of the present
international life and the basis of the Law of Nations.
There is no doubt that the Law of Nations is a product
of Christian civilisation. It originally arose between
the States of Christendom only, and for hundreds of
years was confined to these States. Between Christian
and Mohammedan nations a condition of perpetual
enmity prevailed in former centuries. And no constant
intercourse existed in former times between Christian
and Buddhistic States. But from about the beginning
of the nineteenth century matters gradually changed.
A condition of perpetual enmity between whole groups<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
of nations exists no longer either in theory or in practice.
And although there is still a broad and deep
gulf between Christian civilisation and others, many
interests, which knit Christian States together, knit
likewise some non-Christian and Christian States.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_27_27"></a><a href="#FNanchor_27_27" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[27]</span></a> See,
 for instance, Bluntschli, § 8,

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_28_28"></a><a href="#FNanchor_28_28" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[28]</span></a> See,

<div class="sidenote"><p>Three Conditions of Membership of the Family of Nations.</p></div>
<p>§ 27. <a id="Thus_the_membership27"></a>Thus the membership of the Family of Nations
has of late necessarily been increased, and the range of
the dominion of the Law of Nations has extended
beyond its original limits. This extension has taken
place in conformity with the basis of the Law of
Nations. As this basis is the common consent of the
civilised States, there are three conditions for the admission
of new members into the circle of the Family
of Nations. A State to be admitted must, first, be a
civilised State which is in constant intercourse with
members of the Family of Nations. Such State must,
secondly, expressly or tacitly consent to be bound for
its future international conduct by the rules of
International Law. And, thirdly, those States which
have hitherto formed the Family of Nations must
expressly or tacitly consent to the reception of the
new member.</p>
<p>The last two conditions are so obvious that they
need no comment. Regarding the first condition, however,
it must be emphasised that not particularly
Christian civilisation, but civilisation of such kind only
is conditioned as to enable the State concerned and its
subjects to understand and to act in conformity with
the principles of the Law of Nations. These principles
cannot be applied to a State which is not able to apply
them on its own part to other States. On the other
hand, they can well be applied to a State which is able
and willing to apply them to other States, provided a
constant intercourse has grown up between it and other
States. The fact is that the Christian States have been
of late compelled by pressing circumstances to receive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
several non-Christian States into the community of
States which are subjects of International Law.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Present range of Dominion of the Law of Nations.</p></div>
<p>§ 28. <a id="The_present_range28"></a>The present range of the dominion of International
Law is a product of historical development
within which epochs are distinguishable marked by
successive entrances of various States into the Family
of Nations.</p>
<p>(1) The old Christian States of Western Europe are
the original members of the Family of Nations, because
the Law of Nations grew up gradually between them
through custom and treaties. Whenever afterwards a
new Christian State made its appearance in Europe, it
was received into the charmed circle by the old members
of the Family of Nations. It is for this reason that
this law was in former times frequently called "European
Law of Nations." But this name has nowadays
historical value only, as it has been changed into "Law
of Nations," or "International Law" pure and simple.</p>
<p>(2) The next group of States which entered into
the Family of Nations is the body of Christian States
which grew up outside Europe. All the American<a id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_29_29">[29]</a>
States which arose out of colonies of European States
belong to this group. And it must be emphasised that
the United States of America have largely contributed
to the growth of the rules of International Law. The
two Christian Negro Republics of Liberia in West
Africa and of Haiti on the island of San Domingo
belong to this group.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_29_29"></a><a href="#FNanchor_29_29" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[29]</span></a> But it ought not to be maintained that there is—in
contradistinction to the European—an American International Law in
existence; see, however, Alvarez, "Le Droit International Américain"
(1910), and again Alvarez in A.J. III. (1909), pp. 269-353.</p></div>
<p>(3) With the reception of the Turkish Empire into
the Family of Nations International Law ceased to be
a law between Christian States solely. This reception
has expressly taken place through Article 7 of the
Peace Treaty of Paris of 1856, in which the five Great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
European Powers of the time, namely, France, Austria,
England, Prussia, and Russia, and besides those
Sardinia, the nucleus of the future Great Power Italy,
expressly "déclarent la Sublime Porte admise à participer
aux avantages du droit public et du concert
européens." Since that time Turkey has on the whole
endeavoured in time of peace and war to act in conformity
with the rules of International Law, and she
has, on the other hand, been treated<a id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_30_30">[30]</a> accordingly by
the Christian States. No general congress has taken
place since 1856 to which Turkey has not been invited
to send her delegates.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_30_30"></a><a href="#FNanchor_30_30" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[30]</span></a> There is no doubt that Turkey, in spite of having been
received into the Family of Nations, has nevertheless hitherto been in
an anomalous position as a member of that family, owing to the fact that
her civilisation has not yet reached the level of that of the Western
States. It is for this reason that the so-called Capitulations are still
in force and that other anomalies still prevail, but their disappearance
is only a question of time.</p></div>
<p>(4) Another non-Christian member of the Family of
Nations is Japan. A generation ago one might have
doubted whether Japan was a real and full member
of that family, but since the end of the nineteenth
century no doubt is any longer justified. Through
marvellous efforts, Japan has become not only a modern
State, but an influential Power. Since her war with
China in 1895, she must be considered one of the Great
Powers that lead the Family of Nations.</p>
<p>(5) The position of such States as Persia, Siam,
China, Morocco, Abyssinia, and the like, is doubtful.
These States are certainly civilised States, and Abyssinia
is even a Christian State. However, their civilisation
has not yet reached that condition which is necessary
to enable their Governments and their population in
every respect to understand and to carry out the command
of the rules of International Law. On the other
hand, international intercourse has widely arisen between
these States and the States of the so-called<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
Western civilisation. Many treaties have been concluded
with them, and there is full diplomatic intercourse
between them and the Western States. China,
Persia, and Siam have even taken part in the Hague
Peace Conferences. All of them make efforts to educate
their populations, to introduce modern institutions,
and thereby to raise their civilisation to the level of
that of the Western. They will certainly succeed in this
respect in the near future. But as yet they have not
accomplished this task, and consequently they are not
yet able to be received into the Family of Nations as
full members. Although they are, as will be shown
 below (§ <a href="#Doubtful_is_the103" class="pginternal">103</a>), for some parts within the circle of the
Family of Nations, they remain for other parts outside.
But the example of Japan can show them that it depends
entirely upon their own efforts to be received
as full members into that family.</p>
<p>(6) It must be mentioned that a State of quite
a unique character, the former Congo Free State,<a id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_31_31">[31]</a>
was, since the Berlin Conference of 1884-1885, a
member of the Family of Nations. But it lost its
membership in 1908 when it merged in Belgium by
cession.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Treatment of States outside the Family of Nations.</p></div>
<p>§ 29. The Law of Nations as a law between States
based on the common consent of the members of the
Family of Nations naturally does not contain any rules
concerning the intercourse with and treatment of such
States as are outside that circle. That this intercourse
and treatment ought to be regulated by the principles
of Christian morality is obvious. But actually a practice
frequently prevails which is not only contrary to
Christian morality, but arbitrary and barbarous. Be
that as it may, it is discretion, and not International
Law, according to which the members of the Family
of Nations deal with such States as still remain outside<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
that family. But the United States of America
apply, as far as possible, the rules of International Law
to their relations with the Red Indians.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Movement in Favour of Codification.</p></div>
<p>§ 30. The lack of precision which is natural to a
large number of the rules of the Law of Nations on
account of its slow and gradual growth has created a
movement for its codification. The idea of a codification
of the Law of Nations in its totality arose at the
end of the eighteenth century. It was Bentham who
first suggested such a codification. He did not, however,
propose codification of the existing positive Law
of Nations, but thought of a utopian International Law
which could be the basis of an everlasting peace between
the civilised States.<a id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_32_32">[32]</a></p>

VIII. p. 537; Nys, in <i>The Law
Quarterly Review</i>, XI. (1885), pp.
226-231.</p></div>
<p>Another utopian project is due to the French Convention,
which resolved in 1792 to create a Declaration
of the Rights of Nations as a pendant to the Declaration
of the Rights of Mankind of 1789. For this purpose
the Abbé Grégoire was charged with the drafting
of such a declaration. In 1795, Abbé Grégoire produced
a draft of twenty-one articles, which, however,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
was rejected by the Convention, and the matter
dropped.<a id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_33_33">[33]</a></p>

full text of these twenty-one articles
is given. They did not contain a
real code, but certain principles
only.</p></div>
<p>It was not until 1861 that a real attempt was
made to show the possibility of a codification. This
was done by an Austrian jurist, Alfons von Domin-Petrushevecz,
who published in that year at Leipzig a
"Précis d'un Code de Droit International."</p>
<p>In 1862, the Russian Professor Katschenowsky
brought an essay before the Juridical Society of London
(Papers II. 1863) arguing the necessity of a codification
of International Law.</p>
<p>In 1863, Professor Francis Lieber, of the Columbia
College, New York, drafted the Laws of War in a body
of rules which the United States published during the
Civil War for the guidance of her army.<a id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_34_34">[34]</a></p>

<p>In 1868, Bluntschli, the celebrated Swiss interpreter
of the Law of Nations, published "Das moderne
Völkerrecht der civilisirten Staaten als Rechtsbuch
dargestellt." This draft code has been translated into
the French, Greek, Spanish, and Russian languages,
and the Chinese Government produced an official
Chinese translation as a guide for Chinese officials.</p>
<p>In 1872, the great Italian politician and jurist
Mancini raised his voice in favour of codification of
the Law of Nations in his able essay "Vocazione del
nostro secolo per la riforma e codificazione del diritto
delle genti."</p>
<p>Likewise in 1872 appeared at New York David
Dudley Field's "Draft Outlines of an International
Code."</p>
<p>In 1873 the Institute of International Law was
founded at Ghent in Belgium. This association of
jurists of all nations meets periodically, and has produced
a number of drafts concerning various parts of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
International Law, and in especial a Draft Code of the
Law of War on Land (1880).</p>
<p>Likewise in 1873 was founded the Association for
the Reform and Codification of the Law of Nations,
which also meets periodically and which styles itself
now the International Law Association.</p>
<p>In 1874 the Emperor Alexander II. of Russia took
the initiative in assembling an international conference
at Brussels for the purpose of discussing a draft code
of the Law of Nations concerning land warfare. At
this conference jurists, diplomatists, and military men
were united as delegates of the invited States, and they
agreed upon a body of sixty articles which goes under
the name of The Declaration of Brussels. But the
Powers have never ratified these articles.</p>
<p>In 1880 the Institute of International Law published
its "Manuel des Lois de la Guerre sur Terre."</p>
<p>In 1887 Leone Levi published his "International
Law with Materials for a Code of International Law."</p>
<p>In 1890 the Italian jurist Fiore published his "Il
diritto internazionale codificato e sua sanzione giuridica,"
of which a fourth edition appeared in 1911.</p>
<p>In 1906 E. Duplessix published his "La loi des
Nations. Projet d'institution d'une autorité nationale,

<div class="sidenote"><p>Work of the first Hague Peace Conference.</p></div>
<p>§ 31. At the end of the nineteenth century, in 1899,
the so-called Peace Conference at the Hague, convened
on the personal initiative of the Emperor Nicholas II.
of Russia, has shown the possibility that parts of the
Law of Nations may well be codified. Apart from
three Declarations of minor value and of the convention
concerning the adaptation of the Geneva Convention
to naval warfare, this conference has succeeded in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
producing two important conventions which may well
be called codes—namely, first, the "Convention for the
Pacific Settlement of International Disputes," and,
secondly, the "Convention with respect to the Laws
and Customs of War on Land." The great practical
importance of the first-named convention is now being
realised, as the Permanent Court of Arbitration has in
a number of cases already successfully given its award.
Nor can the great practical value of the second-named
convention be denied. Although the latter contains,
even in the amended form given to it by the second
Hague Peace Conference of 1907, many gaps, which
must be filled up by the customary Law of Nations, and
although it is not a masterpiece of codification, it represents
a model, the very existence of which teaches that
codification of parts of the Law of Nations is practicable,
provided the Powers are inclined to come to an understanding.
The first Hague Peace Conference has therefore
made an epoch in the history of International Law.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Work of the second Hague Peace Conference and the Naval
Conference of London.</p></div>
<p>§ 32. <a id="Sh32"></a>Shortly after the Hague Peace Conference of
1899, the United States of America took a step with
regard to sea warfare similar to that taken by her in
1863 with regard to land warfare. She published on
June 27, 1900, a body of rules for the use of her navy
under the title "The Laws and Usages of War at Sea"—the
so-called "United States Naval War Code"—which
was drafted by Captain Charles H. Stockton, of
the United States Navy.</p>
<p>Although, on February 4, 1904, this code was by
authority of the President of the United States withdrawn
it provided the starting-point of a movement
for codification of maritime International Law. No
complete Naval War Code agreed upon by the Powers
has as yet made its appearance, but the second Hague
Peace Conference of 1907 and the Naval Conference
of London of 1908-9 have produced a number of law-making<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
treaties which represent codifications of several
parts of maritime International Law.</p>
<p>The second Hague Peace Conference met in 1907
and produced not less than thirteen conventions and
one declaration. This declaration prohibits the discharge
of projectiles and explosives from balloons and
takes the place of a corresponding declaration of the
first Hague Peace Conference. And three of the
thirteen conventions, namely that for the pacific settlement
of international disputes, that concerning the
laws and customs of war on land, and that concerning
the adaptation of the principles of the Geneva Convention
to maritime war, likewise take the place of three
corresponding conventions of the first Hague Peace
Conference. But the other ten conventions are entirely
new and concern: the limitation of the employment
of force for the recovery of contract debts, the
opening of hostilities, the rights and duties of neutral
Powers and persons in war on land, the status of enemy
merchant ships at the outbreak of hostilities, the conversion
of merchant ships into war ships, the laying of
automatic submarine contact mines, bombardments by
naval forces in time of war, restrictions on the exercise
of the right of capture in maritime war, the establishment
of a Prize Court, the rights and duties of neutral
Powers in maritime war.</p>
<p>The Naval Conference of London which met in
November 1908, and sat till February 1909, produced
the Declaration of London, the most important law-making
treaty as yet concluded. Its nine chapters
deal with: blockade, contraband, unneutral service,
destruction of neutral prizes, transfer to a neutral flag,
enemy character, convoy, resistance to search, compensation.
The Declaration of London, when ratified,
will make the establishment of an International Prize
Court possible.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Value of Codification of International Law contested.</p></div>
<p>§ 33. In spite of the movement in favour of codification
of the Law of Nations, there are many eminent
jurists who oppose such codification. They argue that
codification would never be possible on account of
differences of languages and of technical juridical terms.
They assert that codification would cut off the organic
growth and future development of International Law.
They postulate the existence of a permanent International
Court with power of executing its verdicts as
an indispensable condition, since without such a court
no uniform interpretation of controversial parts of a
code could be possible. Lastly, they maintain that the
Law of Nations is not yet at present, and will not be
for a long time to come, ripe for codification. Those
jurists, on the other hand, who are in favour of codification
argue that the customary Law of Nations to a
great extent lacks precision and certainty, that writers
on International Law differ in many points regarding
its rules, and that, consequently, there is no broad and
certain basis for the practice of the States to stand upon.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Merits of Codification in general.</p></div>
<p>§ 34. I am decidedly not a blind and enthusiastic
admirer of codification in general. It cannot be maintained
that codification is everywhere, at all times,
and under all circumstances opportune. Codification
certainly interferes with the so-called organic growth of
the law through usage into custom. It is true that
a law, once codified, cannot so easily adapt itself to
the individual merits of particular cases which come
under it. It is further a fact, which cannot be denied,
that together with codification there frequently enters
into courts of justice and into the area of juridical
literature a hair-splitting tendency and an interpretation
of the law which often clings more to the letter
and the word of the law than to its spirit and its principles.
And it is not at all a fact that codification
does away with controversies altogether. Codification<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
certainly clears up many questions of law which have
been hitherto debatable, but it creates at the same
time new controversies. And, lastly, all jurists know
very well that the art of legislation is still in its infancy
and not at all highly developed. The hands of legislators
are very often clumsy, and legislation often does
more harm than good. Yet, on the other hand, the
fact must be recognised that history has given its
verdict in favour of codification. There is no civilised
State in existence whose Municipal Law is not to a
greater or lesser extent codified. The growth of the
law through custom goes on very slowly and gradually,
very often too slowly to be able to meet the demands
of the interests at stake. New interests and new inventions
very often spring up with which customary
law cannot deal. Circumstances and conditions frequently
change so suddenly that the ends of justice
are not met by the existing customary law of a State.
Thus, legislation, which is, of course, always partial
codification, becomes often a necessity in the face of
which all hesitation and scruple must vanish. Whatever
may be the disadvantages of codification, there
comes a time in the development of every civilised
State when it can no longer be avoided. And great
are the advantages of codification, especially of a codification
that embraces a large part of the law. Many
controversies are done away with. The science of Law
receives a fresh stimulus. A more uniform spirit enters
into the law of the country. New conditions and
circumstances of life become legally recognised. Mortifying
principles and branches are cut off with one
stroke. A great deal of fresh and healthy blood is
brought into the arteries of the body of the law in its
totality. If codification is carefully planned and prepared,
if it is imbued with true and healthy conservatism,
many disadvantages can be avoided. And interpretation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
on the part of good judges can deal with many
a fault that codification has made. If the worst
comes to the worst, there is always a Parliament or
another law-giving authority of the land to mend
through further legislation the faults of previous
codification.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Merits of Codification of International Law.</p></div>
<p>§ 35. But do these arguments in favour of codification
in general also apply to codification of the Law of
Nations? I have no doubt that they do more or less.
If some of these arguments have no force in view of
the special circumstances of the existence of International
Law and of the peculiarities of the Family of
Nations, there are other arguments which take their
place.</p>
<p>When opponents maintain that codification would
never be practicable on account of differences of language
and of technical juridical terms, I answer that
this difficulty is only as great an obstacle in the way
of codification as it is in the way of contracting international
treaties. The fact that such treaties are concluded
every day shows that difficulties which arise out
of differences of language and of technical juridical
terms are not at all insuperable.</p>
<p>Of more weight than this is the next argument of
opponents, that codification of the Law of Nations
would cut off its organic growth and future development.
It cannot be denied that codification always
interferes with the growth of customary law, although
the assertion is not justified that codification does <i>cut
off</i> such growth. But this disadvantage can be met by
periodical revisions of the code and by its gradual
increase and improvement through enactment of additional
and amending rules according to the wants and
needs of the days to come.</p>
<p>When opponents postulate an international court
with power of executing its verdicts as an indispensable
condition of codification, I answer that the non-existence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
of such a court is quite as much or as little
an argument against codification as against the very
existence of International Law. If there is a Law of
Nations in existence in spite of the non-existence of
an international court to guarantee its realisation, I
cannot see why the non-existence of such a court
should be an obstacle to codifying the very same Law
of Nations. It may indeed be maintained that codification
is all the more necessary as such an international
court does not exist. For codification of the Law of
Nations and the solemn recognition of a code by a
universal law-making international treaty would give
more precision, certainty, and weight to the rules of
the Law of Nations than they have now in their unwritten
condition. And a uniform interpretation of a
code is now, since the first Hague Peace Conference
has instituted a Permanent Court of Arbitration, and
since the second Peace Conference has resolved upon
the establishment of an International Prize Court,
much more realisable than in former times, although
these courts will never have the power of executing
their verdicts.</p>
<p>But is the Law of Nations ripe for codification?
I readily admit that there are certain parts of that
law which would offer the greatest difficulty, and which
therefore had better remain untouched for the present.
But there are other parts, and I think that they constitute
the greater portion of the Law of Nations,
which are certainly ripe for codification. There can
be no doubt that, whatever can be said against codification
of the whole of the Law of Nations, partial
codification is possible and comparatively easy. The
work done by the Institute of International Law, and
published in the "Annuaire de l'Institut de Droit
International," gives evidence of it. And the number
and importance of the law-making treaties produced
by the Hague Peace Conferences and the Maritime<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
Conference of London, 1908-9, should leave no doubt
as to the feasibility of such partial codification.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>How Codification could be realised.</p></div>
<p>§ 36. However, although possible, codification could
hardly be realised at once. The difficulties, though not
insuperable, are so great that it would take the work of
perhaps a generation of able jurists to prepare draft
codes for those parts of International Law which may be
considered ripe for codification. The only way in which
such draft codes could be prepared consists in the
appointment on the part of the Powers of an international
committee composed of a sufficient number
of able jurists, whose task would be the preparation
of the drafts. Public opinion of the whole civilised
world would, I am sure, watch the work of these men
with the greatest interest, and the Parliaments of the
civilised States would gladly vote the comparatively
small sums of money necessary for the costs of the
work. But in proposing codification it is necessary to
emphasise that it does not necessarily involve a reconstruction
of the present international order and a
recasting of the whole system of International Law as
it at present stands. Naturally, a codification would
in many points mean not only an addition to the rules
at present recognised, but also the repeal, alteration, and
reconstruction of some of these rules. Yet, however
this may be, I do not believe that a codification ought
to be or could be undertaken which would revolutionise
the present international order and put the whole
system of International Law on a new basis. The
codification which I have in view is one that would
embody the existing rules of International Law together
with such modifications and additions as are
necessitated by the conditions of the age and the very
fact of codification being taken in hand. If International
Law, as at present recognised, is once codified,
nothing prevents reformers from making proposals
which could be realised by successive codification.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>No Law of Nations in antiquity.</p></div>
<p>§ 37. <a id="In37"></a>International Law as a law between Sovereign
and equal States based on the common consent
of these States is a product of modern Christian civilisation,
and may be said to be hardly four hundred years
old. However, the roots of this law go very far back
into history. Such roots are to be found in the rules
and usages which were observed by the different nations
of antiquity with regard to their external relations.
But it is well known that the conception of a Family
of Nations did not arise in the mental horizon of the
ancient world. Each nation had its own religion and
gods, its own language, law, and morality. International
interests of sufficient vigour to wind a band around all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
the civilised States, bring them nearer to each other,
and knit them together into a community of nations,
did not spring up in antiquity. On the other hand,
however, no nation could avoid coming into contact
with other nations. War was waged and peace concluded.
Treaties were agreed upon. Occasionally ambassadors
were sent and received. International trade
sprang up. Political partisans whose cause was lost
often fled their country and took refuge in another.
And, just as in our days, criminals often fled their
country for the purpose of escaping punishment.</p>
<p>Such more or less frequent and constant contact of
different nations with one another could not exist
without giving rise to certain fairly congruent rules
and usages to be observed with regard to external
relations. These rules and usages were considered
under the protection of the gods; their violation called
for religious expiation. It will be of interest to throw
a glance at the respective rules and usages of the
Jews, Greeks, and Romans.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>The Jews.</p></div>
<p>§ 38. Although they were monotheists and the
standard of their ethics was consequently much higher
than that of their heathen neighbours, the Jews did
not in fact raise the standard of the international relations
of their time except so far as they afforded
foreigners living on Jewish territory equality before
the law. Proud of their monotheism and despising
all other nations on account of their polytheism, they
found it totally impossible to recognise other nations
as equals. If we compare the different parts of the
Bible concerning the relations of the Jews with other
nations, we are struck by the fact that the Jews were
sworn enemies of some foreign nations, as the Amalekites,
for example, with whom they declined to have
any relations whatever in peace. When they went to
war with those nations, their practice was extremely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
cruel. They killed not only the warriors on the battlefield,
but also the aged, the women, and the children
in their homes. Read, for example, the short description
of the war of the Jews against the Amalekites in
1 Samuel xv., where we are told that Samuel instructed
King Saul as follows: (3) "Now go and smite Amalek,
and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them
not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling,
ox and sheep, camel and ass." King Saul obeyed
the injunction, save that he spared the life of Agag,
the Amalekite king, and some of the finest animals.
Then we are told that the prophet Samuel rebuked
Saul and "hewed Agag in pieces with his own hand."
Or again, in 2 Samuel xii. 31, we find that King David,
"the man after God's own heart," after the conquest
of the town of Rabbah, belonging to the Ammonites,
"brought forth the people that were therein and put
them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and made
them pass through the brick-kiln...."</p>
<p>With those nations, however, of which they were
not sworn enemies the Jews used to have international
relations. And when they went to war with those
nations, their practice was in no way exceptionally
cruel, if looked upon from the standpoint of their time
and surroundings. Thus we find in Deuteronomy xx.
10-14 the following rules:—</p>
<p>(10) "When thou comest nigh unto a city to fight
against it, then proclaim peace unto it.</p>
<p>(11) "And it shall be, if it make thee answer of
peace and open unto thee, that all the people that is
found therein shall be tributaries unto thee, and they
shall serve thee.</p>
<p>(12) "And if it will make no peace with thee,
but will make war against thee, then thou shalt
besiege it.</p>
<p>(13) "And when the Lord thy God hath delivered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
it into thine hands, thou shalt smite every male thereof
with the edge of the sword.</p>
<p>(14) "But the women, and the little ones, and the
cattle, and all that is in the city, even all the spoil
thereof, shalt thou take unto thyself; and thou shalt
eat the spoil of thine enemies, which the Lord thy God
hath given thee."</p>
<p>Comparatively mild, like these rules for warfare,
were the Jewish rules regarding their foreign slaves.
Such slaves were not without legal protection. The
master who killed a slave was punished (Exodus ii.
20); if the master struck his slave so severely that
he lost an eye or a tooth, the slave became a free man
(Exodus ii. 26 and 27). The Jews, further, allowed
foreigners to live among them under the full protection
of their laws. "Love ... the stranger, for ye were
strangers in the land of Egypt," says Deuteronomy x.
19, and in Leviticus xxiv. 22 there is the command:
"You shall have one manner of law, as well for the
stranger as for one of your own country."</p>
<p>Of the greatest importance, however, for the International
Law of the future, are the Messianic ideals
and hopes of the Jews, as these Messianic ideals and
hopes are not national only, but fully <i>inter</i>national.
The following are the beautiful words in which the
prophet Isaiah (ii. 2-4) foretells the state of mankind
when the Messiah shall have appeared:</p>
<p>(2) "And it shall come to pass in the last days,
that the mountain of the Lord's house shall be established
in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted
above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it.</p>
<p>(3) "And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and
let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of
the God of Jacob, and he will teach us of his ways, and
we will walk in his paths; for out of Zion shall go forth
the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>
<p>(4) "And he shall judge among the nations, and
shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their
swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning-hooks:
nation shall not lift up sword against nation,
neither shall they learn war any more."</p>
<p>Thus we see that the Jews, at least at the time of
Isaiah, had a foreboding and presentiment of a future
when all the nations of the world should be united in
peace. And the Jews have given this ideal to the Christian
world. It is the same ideal which has in bygone
times inspired all those eminent men who have laboured
to build up an International Law. And it is again
the same ideal which nowadays inspires all lovers of
international peace. Although the Jewish State and
the Jews as a nation have practically done nothing to
realise that ideal, yet it sprang up among them and
has never disappeared.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>The Greeks.</p></div>
<p>§ 39. Totally different from this Jewish contribution
to a future International Law is that of the Greeks.
The broad and deep gulf between their civilisation and
that of their neighbours necessarily made them look
down upon those neighbours as barbarians, and thus
prevented them from raising the standard of their
relations with neighbouring nations above the average
level of antiquity. But the Greeks before the Macedonian
conquest were never united into one powerful
national State. They lived in numerous more or less
small city States, which were totally independent of
one another. It is this very fact which, as time went
on, called into existence a kind of International Law
between these independent States. They could never
forget that their inhabitants were of the same race.
The same blood, the same religion, and the same civilisation
of their citizens united these independent and—as
we should say nowadays—Sovereign States into a
community of States which in time of peace and war<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
held themselves bound to observe certain rules as
regards the relations between one another. The consequence
was that the practice of the Greeks in
their wars among themselves was a very mild one.
It was a rule that war should never be commenced
without a declaration of war. Heralds were inviolable.
Warriors who died on the battlefield were entitled to
burial. If a city was captured, the lives of all those
who took refuge in a temple had to be spared. War
prisoners could be exchanged or ransomed; their lot
was, at the utmost, slavery. Certain places, as, for
example, the temple of the god Apollo at Delphi, were
permanently inviolable. Even certain persons in the
armies of the belligerents were considered inviolable, as,
for instance, the priests, who carried the holy fire, and
the seers.</p>
<p>Thus the Greeks left to history the example that
independent and Sovereign States can live, and are
in reality compelled to live, in a community which
provides a law for the international relations of the
member-States, provided that there exist some common
interests and aims which bind these States together.
It is very often maintained that this kind of International
Law of the Greek States could in no way be compared
with our modern International Law, as the Greeks did
not consider their international rules as legally, but as
religiously binding only. We must, however, not forget
that the Greeks never made the same distinction between
law, religion, and morality which the modern
world makes. The fact itself remains unshaken that
the Greek States set an example to the future that
independent States can live in a community in which
their international regulations are governed by certain
rules and customs based on the common consent of the
members of that community.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>The Romans.</p></div>
<p>§ 40. <a id="To40"></a>Totally different again from the Greek contribution<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
to a future International Law is that of the
Romans. As far back as their history goes, the Romans
had a special set of twenty priests, the so-called <i>fetiales</i>,
for the management of functions regarding their relations
with foreign nations. In fulfilling their functions
the <i>fetiales</i> did not apply a purely secular but a divine
and holy law, a <i>jus sacrale</i>, the so-called <i>jus fetiale</i>.
The <i>fetiales</i> were employed when war was declared or
peace was made, when treaties of friendship or of alliance
were concluded, when the Romans had an international
claim before a foreign State, or <i>vice versa</i>.</p>
<p>According to Roman Law the relations of the Romans
with a foreign State depended upon the fact whether
or not there existed a treaty of friendship between
Rome and the respective State. In case no such treaty
was in existence, persons or goods coming from the
foreign land into the land of the Romans, and likewise
persons and goods going from the land of the Romans
into the foreign land, enjoyed no legal protection whatever.
Such persons could be made slaves, and such
goods could be seized, and became the property of the
captor. Should such an enslaved person ever come
back to his country, he was at once considered a free
man again according to the so-called <i>jus postliminii</i>.
An exception was made as regards ambassadors. They
were always considered inviolable, and whoever violated
them was handed over to the home State of those ambassadors
to be punished according to discretion.</p>
<p>Different were the relations when a treaty of friendship
existed. Persons and goods coming from one
country into the other stood then under legal protection.
So many foreigners came in the process of time
to Rome that a whole system of law sprang up regarding
these foreigners and their relations with Roman
citizens, the so-called <i>jus gentium</i> in contradistinction
to the <i>jus civile</i>. And a special magistrate, the
<i>praetor <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
peregrinus</i>, was nominated for the administration of
that law. Of such treaties with foreign nations there
were three different kinds, namely, of <i>friendship</i> (<i>amicitia</i>),
of <i>hospitality</i> (<i>hospitium</i>), or of <i>alliance</i> (<i>foedus</i>).
I do not propose to go into details about them. It
suffices to remark that, although the treaties were concluded
without any such provision, notice of termination
could be given. Very often these treaties used
to contain a provision according to which future controversies
could be settled by arbitration of the so-called
<i>recuperatores</i>.</p>
<p>Very precise legal rules existed as regards war and
peace. Roman law considered war a legal institution.
There were four different just reasons for war, namely:
(1) Violation of the Roman dominion; (2) violation of
ambassadors; (3) violation of treaties; (4) support
given during war to an opponent by a hitherto friendly
State. But even in such cases war was only justified
if satisfaction was not given by the foreign State.
Four <i>fetiales</i> used to be sent as ambassadors to the
foreign State from which satisfaction was asked. If such
satisfaction was refused, war was formally declared by
one of the <i>fetiales</i> throwing a lance from the Roman
frontier into the foreign land. For warfare itself no
legal rules existed, but discretion only, and there are
examples enough of great cruelty on the part of the
Romans. Legal rules existed, however, for the end of
war. War could be ended, first, through a treaty of
peace, which was then always a treaty of friendship.
War could, secondly, be ended by surrender (<i>deditio</i>).
Such surrender spared the enemy their lives and property.
War could, thirdly and lastly, be ended through
conquest of the enemy's country (<i>occupatio</i>). It was in
this case that the Romans could act according to discretion
with the lives and the property of the enemy.</p>
<p>From this sketch of their rules concerning external<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
relations, it becomes apparent that the Romans gave
to the future the example of a State with <i>legal</i> rules
for its foreign relations. As the legal people <i>par excellence</i>,
the Romans could not leave their international
relations without legal treatment. And though this
legal treatment can in no way be compared to modern
International Law, yet it constitutes a contribution
to the Law of Nations of the future, in so far as its
example furnished many arguments to those to whose
efforts we owe the very existence of our modern Law
of Nations.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>No need

Ages.</p></div>
<p>§ 41. The Roman Empire gradually absorbed nearly
the whole civilised ancient world, so far as it was known
to the Romans. They hardly knew of any independent
civilised States outside the borders of their empire.
There was, therefore, neither room nor need for an
International Law as long as this empire existed. It
is true that at the borders of this world-empire there
were always wars, but these wars gave opportunity for
the practice of a few rules and usages only. And
matters did not change when under Constantine the
Great (313-337) the Christian faith became the religion
of the empire and Byzantium its capital instead of
Rome, and, further, when in 395 the Roman Empire
was divided into the Eastern and the Western Empire.
This Western Empire disappeared in 476, when Romulus
Augustus, the last emperor, was deposed by Odoacer,
the leader of the Germanic soldiers, who made himself
ruler in Italy. The land of the extinct Western Roman
Empire came into the hands of different peoples, chiefly
of Germanic extraction. In Gallia the kingdom of the
Franks springs up in 486 under Chlodovech the Merovingian.
In Italy, the kingdom of the Ostrogoths
under Theoderich the Great, who defeated Odoacer,
rises in 493. In Spain the kingdom of the Visigoths
appears in 507. The Vandals had, as early as in 429,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
erected a kingdom in Africa, with Carthage as its
capital. The Saxons had already gained a footing in
Britannia in 449.</p>
<p>All these peoples were barbarians in the strict sense
of the term. Although they had adopted Christianity,
it took hundreds of years to raise them to the standard
of a more advanced civilisation. And, likewise,
hundreds of years passed before different nations came
to light out of the amalgamation of the various peoples
that had conquered the old Roman Empire with the
residuum of the population of that empire. It was in
the eighth century that matters became more settled.
Charlemagne built up his vast Frankish Empire, and
was, in 800, crowned Roman Emperor by Pope Leo
III. Again the whole world seemed to be one empire,
headed by the Emperor as its temporal, and by the
Pope as its spiritual, master, and for an International
Law there was therefore no room and no need. But
the Frankish Empire did not last long. According to
the Treaty of Verdun, it was, in 843, divided into three
parts, and with that division the process of development
set in, which led gradually to the rise of the several
States of Europe.</p>
<p>In theory the Emperor of the Germans remained for
hundreds of years to come the master of the world,
but in practice he was not even master at home, as the
German Princes step by step succeeded in establishing
their independence. And although theoretically the
world was well looked after by the Emperor as its temporal
and the Pope as its spiritual head, there were
constantly treachery, quarrelling, and fighting going on.
War practice was the most cruel possible. It is true
that the Pope and the Bishops succeeded sometimes in
mitigating such practice, but as a rule there was no
influence of the Christian teaching visible.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>The Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries.</p></div>
<p>§ 42. The necessity for a Law of Nations did not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
arise until a multitude of States absolutely independent
of one another had successfully established themselves.
The process of development, starting from the Treaty
of Verdun of 843, reached that climax with the reign of
Frederic III., Emperor of the Germans from 1440 to
1493. He was the last of the emperors crowned in Rome
by the hands of the Popes. At that time Europe was,
in fact, divided up into a great number of independent
States, and thenceforth a law was needed to deal with
the international relations of these Sovereign States.
Seven factors of importance prepared the ground for the
growth of principles of a future International Law.</p>
<p>(1) There were, first, the Civilians and the Canonists.
Roman Law was in the beginning of the twelfth century
brought back to the West through Irnerius, who taught
this law at Bologna. He and the other <i>glossatores</i> and
<i>post-glossatores</i> considered Roman Law the <i>ratio scripta</i>,
the law <i>par excellence</i>. These Civilians maintained that
Roman Law was the law of the civilised world <i>ipso
facto</i> through the emperors of the Germans being the
successors of the emperors of Rome. Their commentaries
to the <i>Corpus Juris Civilis</i> touch upon many
questions of the future International Law which they
discuss from the basis of Roman Law.</p>
<p>The Canonists, on the other hand, whose influence
was unshaken till the time of the Reformation, treated
from a moral and ecclesiastical point of view many
questions of the future International Law concerning
war.<a id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_35_35">[35]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_35_35"></a><a href="#FNanchor_35_35" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[35]</span></a> See
 Holland, Studies, pp. 40-58; Walker, History, I. pp. 204-212.</p></div>
<p>(2) There were, secondly, collections of Maritime
Law of great importance which made their appearance
in connection with international trade. From the
eighth century the world trade, which had totally disappeared
in consequence of the downfall of the Roman
Empire and the destruction of the old civilisation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
during the period of the Migration of the Peoples,
began slowly to develop again. The sea trade specially
flourished and fostered the growth of rules and customs
of Maritime Law, which were collected into codes and
gained some kind of international recognition. The
more important of these collections are the following:
The <i>Consolato del Mare</i>, a private collection made at
Barcelona in Spain in the middle of the fourteenth
century; the <i>Laws of Oléron</i>, a collection, made in the
twelfth century, of decisions given by the maritime
court of Oléron in France; the <i>Rhodian Laws</i>, a very
old collection of maritime laws which probably was put
together between the sixth and the eighth centuries;<a id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_36_36">[36]</a>
the <i>Tabula Amalfitana</i>, the maritime laws of the town
of Amalfi in Italy, which date at latest from the tenth
century; the <i>Leges Wisbuenses</i>, a collection of maritime
laws of Wisby on the island of Gothland, in Sweden,
dating from the fourteenth century.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_36_36"></a><a href="#FNanchor_36_36" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[36]</span></a> See
 Ashburner, "The Rhodian Sea Law" (1909), Introduction, p. cxii.</p></div>
<p>The growth of international trade caused also the
rise of the controversy regarding the freedom of the
high seas (see
  below, § <a href="#In_antiquity248" class="pginternal">248</a>), which indirectly influenced
the growth of an International Law (see
  below, §§ <a href="#In_antiquity248" class="pginternal">248</a>-250).</p>
<p>(3) A third factor was the numerous leagues of
trading towns for the protection of their trade and
trading citizens. The most celebrated of these leagues
is the Hanseatic, formed in the thirteenth century.
These leagues stipulated for arbitration on controversies
between their member towns. They acquired trading
privileges in foreign States. They even waged war,
when necessary, for the protection of their interests.</p>
<p>(4) A fourth factor was the growing custom on the
part of the States of sending and receiving permanent
legations. In the Middle Ages the Pope alone had a
permanent legation at the court of the Frankish kings.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
Later, the Italian Republics, as Venice and Florence for
instance, were the first States to send out ambassadors,
who took up their residence for several years in the
capitals of the States to which they were sent. At last,
from the end of the fifteenth century, it became a universal
custom for the kings of the different States to
keep permanent legations at one another's capital.
The consequence was that an uninterrupted opportunity
was given for discussing and deliberating common
international interests. And since the position of
ambassadors in foreign countries had to be taken into
consideration, international rules concerning inviolability
and exterritoriality of foreign envoys gradually
grew up.</p>
<p>(5) A fifth factor was the custom of the great States
of keeping standing armies, a custom which also dates
from the fifteenth century. The uniform and stern
discipline in these armies favoured the rise of more
universal rules and practices of warfare.</p>
<p>(6) A sixth factor was the Renaissance and the
Reformation. The Renaissance of science and art in
the fifteenth century, together with the resurrection of
the knowledge of antiquity, revived the philosophical
and aesthetical ideals of Greek life and transferred
them to modern life. Through their influence the
spirit of the Christian religion took precedence of its
letter. The conviction awoke everywhere that the
principles of Christianity ought to unite the Christian
world more than they had done hitherto, and that
these principles ought to be observed in matters international
as much as in matters national. The Reformation,
on the other hand, put an end to the spiritual
mastership of the Pope over the civilised world. Protestant
States could not recognise the claim of the Pope
to arbitrate as of right in their conflicts either between
one another or between themselves and Catholic States.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>
<p>(7) A seventh factor made its appearance in connection
with the schemes for the establishment of eternal
peace which arose from the beginning of the fourteenth
century. Although these schemes were utopian, they
nevertheless must have had great influence by impressing
upon the Princes and the nations of Christendom
the necessity for some kind of organisation of the
numerous independent States into a community. The
first of these schemes was that of the French lawyer,
Pierre Dubois, who, as early as 1306, in "De Recuperatione
Terre Sancte" proposed an alliance between all
Christian Powers for the purpose of the maintenance of
peace and the establishment of a Permanent Court of
Arbitration for the settlement of differences between
the members of the alliance.<a id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_37_37">[37]</a> Another project arose in
1461, when Podiebrad, King of Bohemia from 1420-1471,
adopted the scheme of his Chancellor, Antoine
Marini, and negotiated with foreign courts the foundation
of a Federal State to consist of all the existing
Christian States with a permanent Congress, seated at
Basle, of ambassadors of all the member States as the
highest organ of the Federation.<a id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_38_38">[38]</a> A third plan was
that of Sully, adopted by Henri IV. of France, which
proposed the division of Europe into fifteen States and
the linking together of these into a federation with a
General Council as its highest organ, consisting of
Commissioners deputed by the member States.<a id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_39_39">[39]</a> A
fourth project was that of Émeric Crucée, who, in 1623,
proposed the establishment of a Union consisting not
only of the Christian States but of all States then existing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
in the whole of the world, with a General Council
as its highest organ, seated at Venice, and consisting
of ambassadors of all the member States of the Union.<a id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_40_40">[40]</a></p>

</p><p>
The schemes enumerated in the text are those which were advanced before
the appearance of Grotius's work "De Jure Belli ac Pacis" (1625). The
numerous plans which made their appearance afterwards—that of the
Landgrave of Hesse-Rheinfels, 1666; of Charles, Duke of Lorraine, 1688;
of William Penn, 1693; of John Bellers, 1710; of the Abbé de St. Pierre
(1658-1743); of Kant, 1795; and of others—are all discussed in
Schücking, "Die Organisation der Welt" (1909), and Darby, "International
Arbitration" (4th ed. 1904). They are as utopian as the pre-Grotian
schemes, but they are nevertheless of great importance. They preached
again and again the gospel of the organisation of the Family of Nations,
and although their ideal has not been and can never be realised, they
drew the attention of public opinion to the fact that the international
relations of States should not be based on arbitrariness and anarchy,
but on rules of law and comity. And thereby they have indirectly
influenced the gradual growth of rules of law for these international
relations.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>The time of Grotius.</p></div>
<p>§ 43. The seventeenth century found a multitude of
independent States established and crowded on the
comparatively small continent of Europe. Many interests
and aims knitted these States together into a
community of States. International lawlessness was
henceforth an impossibility. This was the reason for
the fact that Grotius's work "De Jure Belli ac Pacis<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
libri III.," which appeared in 1625, won the ear of the
different States, their rulers, and their writers on matters
international. Since a Law of Nations was now a
necessity, since many principles of such a law were
already more or less recognised and appeared again
among the doctrines of Grotius, since the system of
Grotius supplied a legal basis to most of those
international relations which were at the time considered
as wanting such basis, the book of Grotius
obtained such a world-wide influence that he is correctly
styled the "Father of the Law of Nations." It
would be very misleading and in no way congruent with
the facts of history to believe that Grotius's doctrines
were as a body at once universally accepted. No such
thing happened, nor could have happened. What did
soon take place was that, whenever an international
question of legal importance arose, Grotius's book was
consulted, and its authority was so overwhelming that
in many cases its rules were considered right. How
those rules of Grotius, which have more or less quickly
been recognised by the common consent of the writers
on International Law, have gradually received similar
acceptance at the hands of the Family of Nations is
a process of development which in each single phase
cannot be ascertained. It can only be stated that at
the end of the seventeenth century the civilised States
considered themselves bound by a Law of Nations the
rules of which were to a great extent the rules of Grotius.
This does not mean that these rules have from the end
of that century never been broken. On the contrary,
they have frequently been broken. But whenever this
occurred, the States concerned maintained either that
they did not intend to break these rules, or that their
acts were in harmony with them, or that they were
justified by just causes and circumstances in breaking
them. And the development of the Law of Nations did<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
not come to a standstill with the reception of the bulk
of the rules of Grotius. More and more rules were
gradually required and therefore gradually grew. All
the historically important events and facts of international
life from the time of Grotius down to our own
have, on the one hand, given occasion to the manifestation
of the existence of a Law of Nations, and, on the
other hand, in their turn made the Law of Nations
constantly and gradually develop into a more perfect
and more complete system of legal rules.</p>
<p>It serves the purpose to divide the history of the
development of the Law of Nations from the time of
Grotius into seven periods—namely, 1648-1721, 1721-1789,
1789-1815, 1815-1856, 1856-1874, 1874-1899,
1899-1911.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>The period
1648-1721.</p></div>
<p>§ 44. The ending of the Thirty Years' War through
the Westphalian Peace of 1648 is the first event of
great importance after the death of Grotius in 1645.
What makes remarkable the meetings of Osnaburg,
where the Protestant Powers met, and Münster, where
the Catholic Powers met, is the fact that there was for
the first time in history a European Congress assembled
for the purpose of settling matters international by
common consent of the Powers. With the exception of
England, Russia, and Poland, all the important Christian
States were represented at this congress, as were
also the majority of the minor Powers. The arrangements
made by this congress show what a great change
had taken place in the condition of matters international.
The Swiss Confederation and the Netherlands were
recognised as independent States. The 355 different
States which belonged to the German Empire were
practically, although not theoretically, recognised as
independent States which formed a Confederation under
the Emperor as its head. Of these 355 States, 150
were secular States governed by hereditary monarchs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
(Electors, Dukes, Landgraves, and the like), 62 were
free-city States, and 123 were ecclesiastical States
governed by archbishops and other Church dignitaries.
The theory of the unity of the civilised world under
the German Emperor and the Pope as its temporal and
spiritual heads respectively was buried for ever. A multitude
of recognised independent States formed a community
on the basis of equality of all its members. The
conception of the European equilibrium<a id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_41_41">[41]</a> made its
appearance and became an implicit principle as a
guaranty of the independence of the members of the
Family of Nations. Protestant States took up their
position within this family along with Catholic States,
as did republics along with monarchies.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_41_41"></a><a href="#FNanchor_41_41" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[41]</span></a> See

 <a href="#Page_307" class="pginternal">307</a>.</p></div>
<p>In the second half of the seventeenth century the
policy of conquest initiated by Louis XIV. of France
led to numerous wars. But Louis XIV. always pleaded
a just cause when he made war, and even the establishment
of the ill-famed so-called Chambers of Reunion
(1680-1683) was done under the pretext of law.
There was no later period in history in which the principles
of International Law were more frivolously
violated, but the violation was always cloaked by some
excuse. Five treaties of peace between France and
other Powers during the reign of Louis XIV. are of
great importance. (1) The Peace of the Pyrenees,
which ended in 1659 the war between France and Spain,
who had not come to terms at the Westphalian Peace.
(2) The Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, which ended in 1668
another war between France and Spain, commenced in
1667 because France claimed the Spanish Netherlands
from Spain. This peace was forced upon Louis XIV.
through the triple alliance between England, Holland,
and Sweden. (3) The Peace of Nymeguen, which ended
in 1678 the war originally commenced by Louis XIV.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
in 1672 against Holland, into which many other
European Powers were drawn. (4) The Peace of Ryswick,
which ended in 1697 the war that had existed
since 1688 between France on one side, and, on the
other, England, Holland, Denmark, Germany, Spain,
and Savoy. (5) The Peace of Utrecht, 1713, and the
Peace of Rastadt and Baden, 1714, which ended the war
of the Spanish Succession that had lasted since 1701
between France and Spain on the one side, and, on the
other, England, Holland, Portugal, Germany, and Savoy.</p>
<p>But wars were not only waged between France and
other Powers during this period. The following treaties
of peace must therefore be mentioned:—(1) The Peaces
of Roeskild (1658), Oliva (1660), Copenhagen (also 1660),
and Kardis (1661). The contracting Powers were
Sweden, Denmark, Poland, Prussia, and Russia. (2)
The Peace of Carlowitz, 1699, between Turkey, Austria,
Poland, and Venice. (3) The Peace of Nystaedt, 1721,
between Sweden and Russia under Peter the Great.</p>
<p>The year 1721 is epoch-making because with the
Peace of Nystaedt Russia enters as a member into the
Family of Nations, in which she at once held the position
of a Great Power. The period ended by the year
1721 shows in many points progressive tendencies
regarding the Law of Nations. Thus the right of visit
and search on the part of belligerents over neutral
vessels becomes recognised. The rule "free ships, free
goods," rises as a postulate, although it was not universally
recognised till 1856. The effectiveness of
blockades, which were first made use of in war by the
Netherlands at the end of the sixteenth century, rose
as a postulate and became recognised in treaties between
Holland and Sweden (1667) and Holland and England
(1674), although its universal recognition was not realised
until the nineteenth century. The freedom of the
high seas, claimed by Grotius and others, began gradually<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
to obtain recognition in practice, although it did
likewise not meet with universal acceptance till the
nineteenth century. The balance of power is solemnly
recognised by the Peace of Utrecht as a principle of
the Law of Nations.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>The period
1721-1789.</p></div>
<p>§ 45. Before the end of the first half of the eighteenth
century peace in Europe was again disturbed. The
rivalry between Austria and Prussia, which had become
a kingdom in 1701 and the throne of which Frederick II.
had ascended in 1740, led to several wars in which England,
France, Spain, Bavaria, Saxony, and Holland took
part. Several treaties of peace were successively concluded
which tried to keep up or re-establish the balance
of power in Europe. The most important of these
treaties are: (1) The Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle of 1748
between France, England, Holland, Austria, Prussia,
Sardinia, Spain, and Genoa. (2) The Peace of Hubertsburg
and the Peace of Paris, both of 1763, the former
between Prussia, Austria, and Saxony, the latter between
England, France, and Spain. (3) The Peace of
Versailles of 1783 between England, the United States
of America, France, and Spain.</p>
<p>These wars gave occasion to disputes as to the right
of neutrals and belligerents regarding trade in time of
war. Prussia became a Great Power. The so-called
First Armed Neutrality<a id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_42_42">[42]</a> made its appearance in 1780
with claims of great importance, which were not generally
recognised till 1856. The United States of America
succeeded in establishing her independence and became
a member of the Family of Nations, whose future attitude
fostered the growth of several rules of International
Law.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>The period 1789-1815.</p></div>
<p>§ 46. All progress, however, was endangered, and
indeed the Law of Nations seemed partly non-existent,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
during the time of the French Revolution and the
Napoleonic wars. Although the French Convention
resolved in 1792 (as stated above, § 30) to create a
"Declaration of the Rights of Nations," the Revolutionary
Government and afterwards Napoleon I. very
often showed no respect for the rules of the Law of
Nations. The whole order of Europe, which had been
built up by the Westphalian and subsequent treaties of
peace for the purpose of maintaining a balance of power,
was overthrown. Napoleon I. was for some time the
master of Europe, Russia and England excepted. He
arbitrarily created States and suppressed them again.
He divided existing States into portions and united
separate States. The kings depended upon his goodwill,
and they had to follow orders when he commanded.
Especially as regards maritime International Law, a
condition of partial lawlessness arose during this period.
Already in 1793 England and Russia interdicted all
navigation with the ports of France, with the intention
of subduing her by famine. The French Convention
answered with an order to the French fleet to capture
all neutral ships carrying provisions to the ports of
the enemy or carrying enemy goods. Again Napoleon,
who wanted to ruin England by destroying her commerce,
announced in 1806 in his Berlin Decrees the
boycott of all English goods. England answered with
the blockade of all French ports and all ports of the
allies of France, and ordered her fleet to capture all
ships destined to any such port.</p>
<p>When at last the whole of Europe was mobilised
against Napoleon and he was finally defeated, the whole
face of Europe was changed, and the former order of
things could not possibly be restored. It was the task
of the European Congress of Vienna in 1814 and 1815
to create a new order and a fresh balance of power.
This new order comprised chiefly the following arrangements:—The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
Prussian and the Austrian monarchies
were re-established, as was also the Germanic Confederation,
which consisted henceforth of thirty-nine
member States. A kingdom of the Netherlands was
created out of Holland and Belgium. Norway and
Sweden became a Real Union. The old dynasties were
restored in Spain, in Sardinia, in Tuscany, and in
Modena, as was also the Pope in Rome. To the nineteen
cantons of the Swiss Confederation were added
those of Geneva, Valais, and Neuchâtel, and this Confederation
was neutralised for all the future.</p>
<p>But the Vienna Congress did not only establish a
new political order in Europe, it also settled some
questions of International Law. Thus, free navigation
was agreed to on so-called international rivers, which
are rivers navigable from the Open Sea and running
through the land of different States. It was further
arranged that henceforth diplomatic agents should be
divided into three classes (Ambassadors, Ministers,
Chargés d'Affaires). Lastly, a universal prohibition of
the trade in negro slaves was agreed upon.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>The
period
1815-1856.</p></div>
<p>§ 47. The period after the Vienna Congress begins
with the so-called Holy Alliance. Already on September
26, 1815, before the second Peace of Paris, the
Emperors of Russia and Austria and the King of Prussia
called this alliance into existence, the object of which
was to make it a duty upon its members to apply the
principles of Christian morality in the administration
of the home affairs of their States as well as in the
conduct of their international relations. After the
Vienna Congress the sovereigns of almost all the European
States had joined that alliance with the exception
of England. George IV., at that time prince-regent
only, did not join, because the Holy Alliance was an
alliance not of the States, but of sovereigns, and therefore
was concluded without the signatures of the respective<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
responsible Ministers, whereas according to the
English Constitution the signature of such a responsible
Minister would have been necessary.</p>
<p>The Holy Alliance had not as such any importance
for International Law, for it was a religious, moral, and
political, but scarcely a legal alliance. But at the
Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1818, which the Emperors
of Russia and Austria and the King of Prussia
attended in person, and where it might be said that the
principles of the Holy Alliance were practically applied,
the Great Powers signed a Declaration,<a id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_43_43">[43]</a> in which they
solemnly recognised the Law of Nations as the basis
of all international relations, and in which they pledged
themselves for all the future to act according to its
rules. The leading principle of their politics was that
of legitimacy,<a id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_44_44">[44]</a> as they endeavoured to preserve everywhere
the old dynasties and to protect the sovereigns
of the different countries against revolutionary movements
of their subjects. This led, in fact, to a dangerous
neglect of the principles of International Law regarding
intervention. The Great Powers, with the exception
of England, intervened constantly with the domestic
affairs of the minor States in the interest of the legitimate
dynasties and of an anti-liberal legislation. The
Congresses at Troppau, 1820, Laibach, 1821, Verona,
1822, occupied themselves with a deliberation on such
interventions.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_43_43"></a><a href="#FNanchor_43_43" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[43]</span></a> See
 Martens, N.R. IV. p. 560.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_44_44"></a><a href="#FNanchor_44_44" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[44]</span></a> See
 Brockhaus, "Das Legitimitätsprincip" (1868).</p></div>
<p>The famous Monroe Doctrine (see
 below, § <a href="#The139" class="pginternal">139</a>)
owes its origin to that dangerous policy of the European
Powers as regards intervention, although this doctrine
embraces other points besides intervention. As from
1810 onwards the Spanish colonies in South America
were falling off from the mother country and declaring
their independence, and as Spain was, after the Vienna<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
Congress, thinking of reconquering these States with
the help of other Powers who upheld the principle of
legitimacy, President Monroe delivered his message on
December 2, 1823, which pointed out amongst other
things, that the United States could not allow the interference
of a European Power with the States of the
American continent.</p>
<p>Different from the intervention of the Powers of the
Holy Alliance in the interest of legitimacy were the
two interventions in the interest of Greece and Belgium.
England, France, and Russia intervened in 1827 in the
struggle of Turkey with the Greeks, an intervention
which led finally in 1830 to the independence of Greece.
And the Great Powers of the time, namely, England,
Austria, France, Prussia, and Russia, invited by the
provisional Belgian Government, intervened in 1830 in
the struggle of the Dutch with the Belgians and secured
the formation of a separate Kingdom of Belgium.</p>
<p>It may be maintained that the establishment of
Greece and Belgium inferred the breakdown of the
Holy Alliance. But it was not till the year 1848 that
this alliance was totally swept away through the disappearance
of absolutism and the victory of the constitutional
system in most States of Europe. Shortly
afterwards, in 1852, Napoleon III., who adopted the
principle of nationality,<a id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_45_45">[45]</a> became Emperor of France.
Since he exercised preponderant influence in Europe,
one may say that this principle of nationality superseded
in European politics the principle of legitimacy.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_45_45"></a><a href="#FNanchor_45_45" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[45]</span></a> See
 Bulmerincq, "Praxis, Theorie und Codification des Völkerrechts"
(1874), pp. 53-70.</p></div>
<p>The last event of this period is the Crimean War,
which led to the Peace as well as to the Declaration
of Paris in 1856. This war broke out in 1853 between
Russia and Turkey. In 1854, England, France, and
Sardinia joined Turkey, but the war continued nevertheless<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
for another two years. Finally, however, Russia
was defeated, a Congress assembled at Paris, where
England, France, Austria, Russia, Sardinia, Turkey,
and eventually Prussia, were represented, and peace
was concluded in March 1856. In the Peace Treaty,
Turkey is expressly received as a member into the
Family of Nations. Of greater importance, however,
is the celebrated Declaration of Paris regarding maritime
International Law which was signed on April 16,
1856, by the delegates of the Powers that had taken
part in the Congress. This declaration abolished
privateering, recognised the rules that enemy goods on
neutral vessels and that neutral goods on enemy vessels
cannot be confiscated, and stipulated that a blockade
in order to be binding must be effective. Together
with the fact that at the end of the first quarter of
the nineteenth century the principle of the freedom
of the high seas<a id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_46_46">[46]</a> became universally recognised, the
Declaration of Paris is a prominent landmark in the
progress of the Law of Nations. The Powers that had
not been represented at the Congress of Paris were
invited to sign the Declaration afterwards, and the
majority of the members of the Family of Nations did
sign it before the end of the year 1856. The few States,
such as the United States of America, Spain, Mexico,
and others, which did not then sign,<a id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_47_47">[47]</a> have in practice
since 1856 not acted in opposition to the Declaration,
and one may therefore, perhaps, maintain that the
Declaration of Paris has already become or will soon
become universal International Law through custom.
Spain and Mexico, however, signed the Declaration in
1907, as Japan had already done in 1886.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_47_47"></a><a href="#FNanchor_47_47" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[47]</span></a> It should be mentioned that the United States did not sign
the Declaration of Paris because it did not go far enough, and did not
interdict capture of private enemy vessels.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>The period 1856-1874.</p></div>
<p>§ 48. The next period, the time from 1856 to 1874,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
is of prominent importance for the development of the
Law of Nations. Under the aegis of the principle of
nationality, Austria turns in 1867 into the dual monarchy
of Austria-Hungary, and Italy as well as Germany
becomes united. The unity of Italy rises out of the
war of France and Sardinia against Austria in 1859,
and Italy ranges henceforth among the Great Powers
of Europe. The unity of Germany is the combined
result of three wars: that of Austria and Prussia in
1864 against Denmark on account of Schleswig-Holstein,
that of Prussia and Italy against Austria in 1866, and
that of Prussia and the allied South German States
against France in 1870. The defeat of France in 1870
had the consequence that Italy took possession of the
Papal States, whereby the Pope disappeared from the
number of governing sovereigns.</p>
<p>The United States of America rise through the successful
termination of the Civil War in 1865 to the
position of a Great Power. Several rules of maritime
International Law owe their further development to
this war. And the instructions concerning warfare on
land, published in 1863 by the Government of the United
States, represent the first step towards codification of
the Laws of War. In 1864, the Geneva Convention for
the amelioration of the condition of soldiers wounded in
armies in the field is, on the initiation of Switzerland,
concluded by nine States, and in time almost all civilised
States became parties to it. In 1868, the Declaration
of St. Petersburg, interdicting the employment in
war of explosive balls below a certain weight, is signed
by many States. Since Russia in 1870 had arbitrarily
shaken off the restrictions of Article 11 of the Peace
Treaty of Paris of 1856 neutralising the Black Sea, the
Conference of London, which met in 1871 and was
attended by the representatives of the Powers which
were parties to the Peace of Paris of 1856, solemnly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
proclaimed "that it is an essential principle of the
Law of Nations that no Power can liberate itself from
the engagements of a treaty, or modify the stipulations
thereof, unless with the consent of the contracting
Powers by means of an amicable arrangement." The
last event in this period is the Conference of Brussels
of 1874 for the codification of the rules and usages of
war on land. Although the signed code was never
ratified, the Brussels Conference was nevertheless epoch-making,
since it showed the readiness of the Powers to
come to an understanding regarding such a code.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>The period
1874-1899.</p></div>
<p>§ 49. After 1874 the principle of nationality continues
to exercise its influence as before. Under its
aegis takes place the partial decay of the Ottoman
Empire. The refusal of Turkey to introduce reforms
regarding the Balkan population led in 1877 to war
between Turkey and Russia, which was ended in 1878
by the peace of San Stefano. As the conditions of
this treaty would practically have done away with
Turkey in Europe, England intervened and a European
Congress assembled at Berlin in June 1878 which modified
materially the conditions of the Peace of San
Stefano. The chief results of the Berlin Congress are:—(1)
Servia, Roumania, Montenegro become independent
and Sovereign States; (2) Bulgaria becomes an independent
principality under Turkish suzerainty; (3) the
Turkish provinces of Bosnia and Herzegovina come
under the administration of Austria-Hungary; (4) a
new province under the name of Eastern Rumelia is
created in Turkey and is to enjoy great local autonomy
(according to an arrangement of the Conference
of Constantinople in 1885-1886 a bond is created between
Eastern Rumelia and Bulgaria by the appointment
of the Prince of Bulgaria as governor of Eastern
Rumelia); (5) free navigation on the Danube from the
Iron Gates to its mouth in the Black Sea is proclaimed.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>
<p>In 1889 Brazil becomes a Republic and a Federal
State (the United States of Brazil). In the same year
the first Pan-American Congress meets at Washington.</p>
<p>In 1897 Crete revolts against Turkey, war breaks
out between Greece and Turkey, the Powers interfere,
and peace is concluded at Constantinople. Crete becomes
an autonomous half-Sovereign State under
Turkish suzerainty with Prince George of Greece as
governor, who, however, retires in 1906.</p>
<p>In the Far East war breaks out in 1894 between
China and Japan, on account of Korea. China is defeated,
and peace is concluded in 1895 at Shimonoseki.<a id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_48_48">[48]</a>
Japan henceforth ranks as a Great Power. That she
must now be considered a full member of the Family
of Nations becomes apparent from the treaties concluded
soon afterwards by her with other Powers for
the purpose of abolishing their consular jurisdiction
within the boundaries of Japan.</p>

<p>In America the United States intervene in 1898 in
the revolt of Cuba against the motherland, whereby
war breaks out between Spain and the United States.
The defeat of Spain secures the independence of Cuba
through the Peace of Paris<a id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_49_49">[49]</a> of 1898. The United
States acquires Porto Rico and other Spanish West
Indian Islands, and, further, the Philippine Islands,
whereby she becomes a colonial Power.</p>

<p>An event of great importance during this period is
the Congo Conference of Berlin, which took place in
1884-1885, and at which England, Germany, Austria-Hungary,
Belgium, Denmark, Spain, the United States
of America, France, Italy, Holland, Portugal, Russia,
Sweden-Norway, and Turkey were represented. This
conference stipulated freedom of commerce, interdiction
of slave-trade, and neutralisation of the territories in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
Congo district, and secured freedom of navigation on the
rivers Congo and Niger. The so-called Congo Free State
was recognised as a member of the Family of Nations.</p>
<p>A second fact of great importance during this period
is the movement towards the conclusion of international
agreements concerning matters of international administration.
This movement finds expression in the
establishment of numerous International Unions with
special International Offices. Thus a Universal Telegraphic
Union is established in 1875, a Universal Postal
Union in 1878, a Union for the Protection of Industrial
Property in 1883, a Union for the Protection of Works
of Literature and Art in 1886, a Union for the Publication
of Custom Tariffs in 1890. There were also concluded
conventions concerning:—(1) Private International
Law (1900 and 1902); (2) Railway transports
and freights (1890); (3) the metric system (1875); (4)
phylloxera epidemics (1878 and 1881); (5) cholera and
plague epidemics (1893, 1896, &amp;c.); (6) Monetary
Unions (1865, 1878, 1885, 1892, 1893).</p>
<p>A third fact of great importance is that in this
period a tendency arises to settle international conflicts
more frequently than in former times by arbitration.
Numerous arbitrations are actually taking place, and
several treaties are concluded between different States
stipulating the settlement by arbitration of all conflicts
which might arise in future between the contracting
parties.</p>
<p>The last fact of great importance which is epoch-making
for this period is the Peace Conference of the
Hague of 1899. This Conference produces, apart from
three Declarations of minor importance, a Convention
for the Pacific Settlement of International Conflicts, a
Convention regarding the Laws and Customs of War
on Land, and a Convention for the Adaptation to
Maritime Warfare of the Principles of the Geneva Convention.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
It also formulates, among others, the three
wishes (1) that a conference should in the near future
regulate the rights and duties of neutrals, (2) that a
future conference should contemplate the declaration
of the inviolability of private property in naval warfare,
(3) that a future conference should settle the question
of the bombardment of ports, towns, and villages
by naval forces.</p>

<p>§ 50. <a id="Soon_after_the_Hague50"></a>Soon after the Hague Peace Conference, in
October 1899, war breaks out in South Africa between
Great Britain and the two Boer Republics, which leads
to the latter's subjugation at the end of 1901. The
assassination on June 10, 1900, of the German Minister
and the general attack on the foreign legations at
Peking necessitate united action of the Powers against
China for the purpose of vindicating this violation of
the fundamental rules of the Laws of Nations. Friendly
relations are, however, re-established with China on
her submitting to the conditions enumerated in the
Final Protocol of Peking,<a id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_50_50">[50]</a> signed on September 7, 1901.
In December 1902 Great Britain, Germany, and Italy
institute a blockade of the coast of Venezuela for the
purpose of making her comply with their demands for
the indemnification of their subjects wronged during
civil wars in Venezuela, and the latter consents to pay
indemnities to be settled by a mixed commission of
diplomatists.<a id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_51_51">[51]</a> As, however, Powers other than those
blockading likewise claim indemnities, the matter is referred
to the Permanent Court of Arbitration at the
Hague, which in 1904 gives its award<a id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_52_52">[52]</a> in favour of the
blockading Powers. In February 1904 war breaks out
between Japan and Russia on account of Manchuria
and Korea. Russia is defeated, and peace is concluded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
through the mediation of the United States of America,
on September 5, 1905, at Portsmouth.<a id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_53_53">[53]</a> Korea, now
freed from the influence of Russia, places herself by the
Treaty of Seoul<a id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_54_54">[54]</a> of November 17, 1905, under the
protectorate of Japan. Five years later, however, by
the Treaty of Seoul<a id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_55_55">[55]</a> of August 22, 1910, she merges
entirely into Japan.</p>

<p>The Real Union between Norway and Sweden, which

dissolved by the Treaty of Karlstad<a id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_56_56">[56]</a> of October
26, 1905. Norway becomes a separate kingdom under

and France guarantee by the Treaty of Christiania<a id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_57_57">[57]</a> of
November 2, 1907, the integrity of Norway on condition

<p>The rivalry between France and Germany—the
latter protesting against the position conceded to France
in Morocco by the Anglo-French agreement signed at
London on April 8, 1904—leads in January 1906 to the
Conference of Algeciras, in which Great Britain, France,
Germany, Belgium, Holland, Italy, Austria-Hungary,
Portugal, Russia, Sweden, Spain, and the United States
of America take part, and where on April 7, 1906, the
General Act of the International Conference of Algeciras<a id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_58_58">[58]</a>
is signed. This Act, which recognises, on the one hand,
the independence and integrity of Morocco, and, on
the other, equal commercial facilities for all nations in
that country, contains:—(1) A declaration concerning
the organisation of the Moroccan police; (2) regulations
concerning the detection and suppression of the illicit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
trade in arms; (3) an Act of concession for a Moorish
State Bank; (4) a declaration concerning an improved
yield of the taxes and the creation of new sources of
revenue; (5) regulations respecting customs and the
suppression of fraud and smuggling; (6) a declaration
concerning the public services and public works. But
it would seem that this Act has not produced a condition
of affairs of any permanency. Since, in 1911,
internal disturbances in Morocco led to military action
on the part of France and Spain, Germany, in July of
the same year, sent a man-of-war to the port of Agadir.
Thus the Moroccan question has been reopened, and
fresh negotiations for its settlement are taking place
between the Powers.<a id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_59_59">[59]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_59_59"></a><a href="#FNanchor_59_59" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[59]</span></a> It should be mentioned that by
the Treaty of London of December

Italy agree to co-operate in maintaining
the independence and integrity
of Abyssinia; see Martens, N.R.G.
2nd Ser. XXXV. p. 556.</p></div>
<p>Two events of importance occur in 1908. The first
is the merging of the Congo Free State<a id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_60_60">[60]</a> into Belgium,
which annexation is not as yet recognised by all the
Powers. The other is the crisis in the Near East caused
by the ascendency of the so-called Young Turks and
the introduction of a constitution in Turkey. Simultaneously
on October 5, 1908, Bulgaria declares herself
independent, and Austria-Hungary proclaims her sovereignty
over Bosnia and Herzegovina, which two Turkish
provinces had been under her administration since 1878.
This violation of the Treaty of Berlin considerably
endangers the peace of the world, and an international
conference is proposed for the purpose of reconsidering
the settlement of the Near Eastern question. Austria-Hungary,
however, does not consent to this, but prefers
to negotiate with Turkey alone in the matter, and a
Protocol is signed by the two Powers on February 26,
1909, according to which Turkey receives a substantial
indemnity in money and other concessions. Austria-Hungary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
negotiates likewise with Montenegro alone,
and consents to the modifications in Article 29 of the
Treaty of Berlin concerning the harbour of Antivary,
which is to be freed from Austria-Hungarian control
and is henceforth to be open to warships of all nations.
Whereupon the demand for an international conference
is abandoned and the Powers notify on April 7, 1909,
their consent to the abolition of Article 25 and the
amendment of Article 29 of the Treaty of Berlin.<a id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_61_61">[61]</a></p>

<p>In 1910 Portugal becomes a Republic; but the
Powers, although they enter provisionally into communication
with the <i>de facto</i> government, do not recognise
the Republic until September 1911, after the National
Assembly adopted the republican form of government.</p>
<p>In September 1911 war breaks out between Italy and Turkey, on account of
the alleged maltreatment of Italian subjects in Tripoli.</p>
<p>International Law as a body of rules for the international conduct of
States makes steady progress during this period. This is evidenced by
congresses, conferences, and law-making treaties. Of conferences and
congresses must be mentioned the second, third, and fourth Pan-American
Congresses,<a id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_62_62">[62]</a> which take place at Mexico in 1901, at Rio in 1906, and
at Buenos Ayres in 1910. Although the law-making treaties of these
congresses have not found ratification, their importance cannot be
denied. Further, in 1906 a conference assembles in Geneva for the
purpose of revising the Geneva Convention of 1864 concerning the wounded
in land warfare, and on July 6, 1906, the new Geneva<a id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_63_63">[63]</a> Convention is
signed. Of the greatest importance, however, are the second Hague Peace
Conference of 1907 and the Naval Conference of London of 1898-9.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_62_62"></a><a href="#FNanchor_62_62" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[62]</span></a> See

<p>The second Peace Conference assembles at the Hague
on June 15, 1907. Whereas at the first there were
only 26 States represented, 44 are represented at the
second Peace Conference. The result of this Conference
is contained in its Final Act,<a id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_64_64">[64]</a> which is signed on
October 18, 1907, and embodies no fewer than thirteen
law-making Conventions besides a declaration of minor
importance. Of these Conventions, 1, 4, and 10 are
mere revisions of Conventions agreed upon at the first
Peace Conference of 1899, but the others are new and
concern:—The employment of force for the recovery
of contract debts (2); the commencement of hostilities (3);
the rights and duties of neutrals in land warfare (5);
the status of enemy merchant-ships at the outbreak
of hostilities (6); the conversion of merchantmen
into men-of-war (7); the laying of submarine mines (8);
the bombardment by naval forces (9); restrictions of
the right of capture in maritime war (11); the establishment
of an International Prize Court (12); the
rights and duties of neutrals in maritime war (13).</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_64_64"></a><a href="#FNanchor_64_64" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[64]</span></a> See
 Martens, N.R.G. 3rd Ser. III. p. 323.</p></div>
<p>The Naval Conference of London assembles on
December 4, 1908, for the purpose of discussing the
possibility of creating a code of prize law without
which the International Prize Court, agreed upon at
the second Hague Peace Conference, could not be
established, and produces the Declaration of London,
signed on February 26, 1909. This Declaration contains
71 articles, and settles in nine chapters the law concerning:—(1)
Blockade; (2) contraband; (3) un-neutral
service; (4) destruction of neutral prizes; (5)
transfer to a neutral flag; (6) enemy character; (7)
convoy; (8) resistance to search; and (9) compensation.
The Declaration is accompanied by a General
Report on its stipulations which is intended to serve as
an official commentary.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>
<p>The movement which began in the last half of the
nineteenth century towards the conclusion of international
agreements concerning matters of international
administration, develops favourably during this period.
The following conventions are the outcome of this
movement:—(1) Concerning the preservation of wild
animals, birds, and fish in Africa (1900); (2) concerning
international hydrographic and biological investigations
in the North Sea (1901); (3) concerning protection of
birds useful for agriculture (1902); (4) concerning the
production of sugar (1902); (5) concerning the White
Slave traffic (1904); (6) concerning the establishment
of an International Agricultural Institute at Rome
(1905); (7) concerning unification of the Pharmacopœial
Formulas (1906); (8) concerning the prohibition of the
use of white phosphorus (1906); (9) concerning the prohibition
of night work for women (1906); (10) concerning
the international circulation of motor vehicles (1909).</p>
<p>It is, lastly, of the greatest importance to mention
that the so-called peace movement,<a id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_65_65">[65]</a> which aims at the
settlement of all international disputes by arbitration
or judicial decision of an International Court, gains
considerable influence over the Governments and public
opinion everywhere since the first Hague Peace Conference.
A great number of arbitration treaties are
agreed upon, and the Permanent Court of Arbitration
established at the Hague gives its first award<a id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_66_66">[66]</a> in a case
in 1902 and its ninth in 1911. The influence of these
decisions upon the peaceful settlement of international
differences generally is enormous, and it may confidently
be expected that the third Hague Peace Conference
will make arbitration obligatory for some of the
matters which do not concern the vital interests, the
honour, and the independence of the States. It is a
hopeful sign that, whereas most of the existing arbitration<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
treaties exempt conflicts which concern the vital
interests, the honour, and the independence, Argentina
and Chili in 1902, Denmark and Holland in 1903, Denmark
and Italy in 1905, Denmark and Portugal in 1907,
Argentina and Italy in 1907, the Central American
Republics of Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua,
and San Salvador in 1907, Italy and Holland in
1907, entered into general arbitration treaties according
to which all differences, without any exception, shall be
settled by arbitration.<a id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_67_67">[67]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Six Lessons of the History of the Law of Nations.</p></div>
<p>§ 51. It is the task of history, not only to show how
things have grown in the past, but also to extract a
moral for the future out of the events of the past. Six
morals can be said to be deduced from the history of
the development of the Law of Nations:</p>
<p>(1) The first and principal moral is that a Law of
Nations can exist only if there be an equilibrium, a
balance of power, between the members of the Family
of Nations. If the Powers cannot keep one another
in check, no rules of law will have any force, since an
over-powerful State will naturally try to act according
to discretion and disobey the law. As there is not
and never can be a central political authority above the
Sovereign States that could enforce the rules of the
Law of Nations, a balance of power must prevent any
member of the Family of Nations from becoming omnipotent.
The history of the times of Louis XIV. and
Napoleon I. shows clearly the soundness of this principle.<a id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_68_68">[68]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_68_68"></a><a href="#FNanchor_68_68" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[68]</span></a> Attention ought to be drawn to the fact that, although the
necessity of a balance of power is generally recognised, there are some
writers of great authority who vigorously oppose this principle, as, for
instance, Bulmerincq, "Praxis, Theorie und Codification des
Völkerrechts" (1874), pp. 40-50. On the principle itself see Donnadieu,
"Essai sur la Théorie de l'Équilibre" (1900), and Dupuis, "Le Principe
d'Équilibre et de Concert Européen" (1909).</p></div>
<p>(2) The second moral is that International Law can
develop progressively only when international politics,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
especially intervention, are made on the basis of real
State interests. Dynastic wars belong to the past, as
do interventions in favour of legitimacy. It is neither
to be feared, nor to be hoped, that they should occur
again in the future. But if they did, they would hamper
the development of the Law of Nations in the future as
they have done in the past.</p>
<p>(3) The third moral is that the principle of nationality
is of such force that it is fruitless to try to stop its
victory. Wherever a community of many millions of
individuals, who are bound together by the same blood,
language, and interests, become so powerful that they
think it necessary to have a State of their own, in which
they can live according to their own ideals and can
build up a national civilisation, they will certainly get
that State sooner or later. What international politics
can, and should, do is to enforce the rule that minorities
of individuals of another race shall not be outside the
law, but shall be treated on equal terms with the majority.
States embracing a population of several nationalities
can exist and will always exist, as many examples show.</p>
<p>(4) The fourth moral is that every progress in the
development of International Law wants due time to
ripen. Although one must hope that the time will
come when war will entirely disappear, there is no
possibility of seeing this hope realised in our time. The
first necessities of an eternal peace are that the surface
of the earth should be shared between States of the
same standard of civilisation, and that the moral ideas
of the governing classes in all the States of the world
should undergo such an alteration and progressive development
as would create the conviction that arbitral
awards and decisions of courts of justice are alone
adequate means for the settlement of international
differences. Eternal peace is an ideal, and in the
very term "ideal" is involved the conviction of the
impossibility of its realisation in the present, although<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
it is a duty to aim constantly at such realisation. The
Permanent Court of Arbitration at the Hague, now
established by the Hague Peace Conference of 1899, is
an institution that can bring us nearer to such realisation
than ever could have been hoped. And codification
of parts of the Law of Nations, following the codification
of the rules regarding land warfare and the
codification comprised in the Declaration of London,
will in due time arrive, and will make the legal basis of
international intercourse firmer, broader, and more
manifest than before.<a id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_69_69">[69]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_69_69"></a><a href="#FNanchor_69_69" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[69]</span></a> See
 Oppenheim, "Die Zukunft des Völkerrechts" (1911) where
some progressive steps are discussed which the future may realise.</p></div>
<p>(5) <a id="The_fifth_moral5of51"></a>The fifth moral is that the progress of International
Law depends to a great extent upon whether
the legal school of International Jurists prevails over
the diplomatic school.<a id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_70_70">[70]</a> The legal school desires International
Law to develop more or less on the lines of
Municipal Law, aiming at the codification of firm, decisive,
and unequivocal rules of International Law, and
working for the establishment of international Courts
for the purpose of the administration of international
justice. The diplomatic school, on the other hand,
considers International Law to be, and prefers it to
remain, rather a body of elastic principles than of firm
and precise rules. The diplomatic school opposes the
establishment of international Courts because it considers
diplomatic settlement of international disputes,
and failing this arbitration, preferable to international
administration of justice by international Courts composed
of permanently appointed judges. There is, however,
no doubt that international Courts are urgently
needed, and that the rules of International Law require
now such an authoritative interpretation and administration
as only an international Court can supply.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_70_70"></a><a href="#FNanchor_70_70" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[70]</span></a> I name these schools "diplomatic" and "legal" for want of
better denomination. They must, however, not be confounded with the
three schools of the "Naturalists," "Positivists," and "Grotians,"
details concerning which will be given below, §§ 55-57.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p></div>
<p>(6) <a id="Th6of51"></a>The sixth, and last, moral is that the progressive
development of International Law depends chiefly upon
the standard of public morality on the one hand, and,
on the other, upon economic interests. The higher the
standard of public morality rises, the more will International
Law progress. And the more important international
economic interests grow, the more International
Law will grow. For, looked upon from a certain stand-point,
International Law is, just like Municipal Law, a
product of moral and of economic factors, and at the
same time the basis for a favourable development of
moral and economic interests. This being an indisputable
fact, it may, therefore, fearlessly be maintained
that an immeasurable progress is guaranteed to International
Law, since there are eternal moral and economic
factors working in its favour.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Forerunners of Grotius.</p></div>
<p>§ 52. The science of the modern Law of Nations
commences from Grotius's work, "De Jure Belli ac
Pacis libri III.," because in it a fairly complete system<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
of International Law was for the first time built up
as an independent branch of the science of law. But
there were many writers before Grotius who wrote on
special parts of the Law of Nations. They are therefore
commonly called "Forerunners of Grotius." The most
important of these forerunners are the following: (1)
Legnano, Professor of Law in the University of Bologna,
who wrote in 1360 his book "De bello, de represaliis,
et de duello," which was, however, not printed before
1477; (2) Belli, an Italian jurist and statesman, who
published in 1563 his book, "De re militari et de bello";
(3) Brunus, a German jurist, who published in 1548 his
book, "De legationibus"; (4) Victoria, Professor in
the University of Salamanca, who published in 1557 his
"Relectiones theologicae,"<a id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_71_71">[71]</a> which partly deals with the
Law of War; (5) Ayala, of Spanish descent but born
in Antwerp, a military judge in the army of Alexandro
Farnese, the Prince of Parma. He published in 1582
his book, "De jure et officiis bellicis et disciplina militari";
(6) Suarez, a Spanish Jesuit and Professor at
Coimbra, who published in 1612 his "Tractatus de
legibus et de legislatore," in which (II. c. 19, n. 8) for
the first time the attempt is made to found a law between
the States on the fact that they form a community
of States; (7) Gentilis (1552-1608), an Italian
jurist, who became Professor of Civil Law in Oxford.
He published in 1585 his work, "De legationibus," in
1588 and 1589 his "Commentationes de jure belli," and
in 1598 an enlarged work on the same matter under the
title "De jure belli libri tres."<a id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_72_72">[72]</a> His "Advocatio Hispanica"
was edited, after his death, in 1613 by his
brother Scipio. Gentilis's book "De jure belli" supplies,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
as Professor Holland shows, the model and the
framework of the first and third book of Grotius's "De
Jure Belli ac Pacis." "The first step"—Holland rightly
says—"towards making International Law what it is
was taken, not by Grotius, but by Gentilis."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Grotius.</p></div>
<p>§ 53. <a id="Although_Grotius_owes_much53"></a>Although Grotius owes much to Gentilis, he
is nevertheless the greater of the two and bears by
right the title of "Father of the Law of Nations."
Hugo Grotius was born at Delft in Holland in 1583.
He was from his earliest childhood known as a "wondrous
child" on account of his marvellous intellectual
gifts and talents. He began to study law at Leyden
when only eleven years old, and at the age of fifteen he
took the degree of Doctor of Laws at Orleans in France.
He acquired a reputation, not only as a jurist, but also
as a Latin poet and a philologist. He first practised
as a lawyer, but afterwards took to politics and became
involved in political and religious quarrels which led to
his arrest in 1618 and condemnation to prison for life.
In 1621, however, he succeeded in escaping from prison
and went to live for ten years in France. In 1634 he
entered into the service of Sweden and became Swedish
Minister in Paris. He died in 1645 at Rostock in Germany
on his way home from Sweden, whither he had
gone to tender his resignation.</p>
<p>Even before he had the intention of writing a book
on the Law of Nations Grotius took an interest in matters
international. For in 1609, when only twenty-four
years old, he published—anonymously at first—a short
treatise under the title "Mare liberum," in which he
contended that the open sea could not be the property
of any State, whereas the contrary opinion was generally
prevalent.<a id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_73_73">[73]</a> But it was not until fourteen years<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
later that Grotius began, during his exile in France, to
write his "De Jure Belli ac Pacis libri III.," which was
published, after a further two years, in 1625, and of
which it has rightly been maintained that no other
book, with the single exception of the Bible, has ever
exercised a similar influence upon human minds and
matters. The whole development of the modern Law
of Nations itself, as well as that of the science of the
Law of Nations, takes root from this for ever famous
book. Grotius's intention was originally to write a
treatise on the Law of War, since the cruelties and lawlessness
of warfare of his time incited him to the work.
But thorough investigation into the matter led him
further, and thus he produced a system of the Law of
Nature and Nations. In the introduction he speaks of
many of the authors before him, and he especially
quotes Ayala and Gentilis. Yet, although he recognises
their influence upon his work, he is nevertheless
aware that his system is fundamentally different from
those of his forerunners. There was in truth nothing
original in Grotius's start from the Law of Nature for
the purpose of deducing therefrom rules of a Law of
Nations. Other writers before his time, and in especial
Gentilis, had founded their works upon it. But nobody
before him had done it in such a masterly way and with
such a felicitous hand. And it is on this account that
Grotius bears not only, as already mentioned, the title
of "Father of the Law of Nations," but also that of
"Father of the Law of Nature."</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_73_73"></a><a href="#FNanchor_73_73" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[73]</span></a> See
 details with regard to the controversy concerning the
freedom of the open sea
 below, §§ <a href="#In_antiquity248" class="pginternal">248</a>-250. Grotius's treatise "Mare
liberum" is—as we know now—the twelfth chapter of the work "De jure
praedae," written in 1604 but never published by Grotius; it was not
printed till 1868. See
 below, § <a href="#Queen_Elizabeths_attitude250" class="pginternal">250</a>.</p></div>
<p>Grotius, as a child of his time, could not help starting
from the Law of Nature, since his intention was to find
such rules of a Law of Nations as were eternal, unchangeable,
and independent of the special consent of
the single States. Long before Grotius, the opinion was
generally prevalent that above the positive law, which
had grown up by custom or by legislation of a State,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
there was in existence another law which had its roots
in human reason and which could therefore be discovered
without any knowledge of positive law. This
law of reason was called Law of Nature or Natural Law.
But the system of the Law of Nature which Grotius
built up and from which he started when he commenced
to build up the Law of Nations, became the most important
and gained the greatest influence, so that
Grotius appeared to posterity as the Father of the Law
of Nature as well as that of the Law of Nations.</p>
<p>Whatever we may nowadays think of this Law of
Nature, the fact remains unshaken that for more than
two hundred years after Grotius jurists, philosophers,
and theologians firmly believed in it. And there is
no doubt that, but for the systems of the Law of Nature
and the doctrines of its prophets, the modern Constitutional
Law and the modern Law of Nations would
not be what they actually are. The Law of Nature
supplied the crutches with whose help history has
taught mankind to walk out of the institutions of the
Middle Ages into those of modern times. The modern
Law of Nations in especial owes its very existence<a id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_74_74">[74]</a> to
the theory of the Law of Nature. Grotius did not deny
that there existed in his time already a good many
customary rules for the international conduct of the
States, but he expressly kept them apart from those
rules which he considered the outcome of the Law of
Nature. He distinguishes, therefore, between the <i>natural</i>
Law of Nations on the one hand, and, on the other hand,
the <i>customary</i> Law of Nations, which he calls the <i>voluntary</i>
Law of Nations. The bulk of Grotius's interest is
concentrated upon the natural Law of Nations, since
he considered the voluntary of minor importance. But
nevertheless he does not quite neglect the voluntary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
Law of Nations. Although he mainly and chiefly lays
down the rules of the natural Law of Nations, he always
mentions also voluntary rules concerning the different
matters.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_74_74"></a><a href="#FNanchor_74_74" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[74]</span></a> See
 Pollock in <i>The Journal of the Society of Comparative Legislation</i>,
New Series, III. (1901), p. 206.</p></div>
<p>Grotius's influence was soon enormous and reached
over the whole of Europe. His book<a id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_75_75">[75]</a> went through
more than forty-five editions, and many translations
have been published.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_75_75"></a><a href="#FNanchor_75_75" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[75]</span></a> See
 Rivier in Holtzendorff, I. p. 412. The last English
translation is that of 1854 by William Whewell.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Zouche.</p></div>
<p>§ 54. But the modern Law of Nations has another,
though minor, founder besides Grotius, and this is an
Englishman, Richard Zouche<a id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_76_76">[76]</a> (1590-1660), Professor of
Civil Law at Oxford and a Judge of the Admiralty
Court. A prolific writer, the book through which he
acquired the title of "Second founder of the Law of
Nations," appeared in 1650 and bears the title: "Juris
et judicii fecialis, sive juris inter gentes, et quaestionum
de eodem explicatio, qua, quae ad pacem et bellum inter
diversos principes aut populos spectant, ex praecipuis
historico jure peritis exhibentur." This little book has
rightly been called the first manual of the <i>positive</i> Law
of Nations. The standpoint of Zouche is totally different
from that of Grotius in so far as, according to
him, the customary Law of Nations is the most important
part of that law, although, as a child of his
time, he does not at all deny the existence of a natural
Law of Nations. It must be specially mentioned that
Zouche is the first who used the term <i>jus inter gentes</i>
for that new branch of law. Grotius knew very well
and says that the Law of Nations is a law <i>between</i> the
States, but he called it <i>jus gentium</i>, and it is due to his
influence that until Bentham nobody called the Law of
Nations <i>Inter</i>national Law.</p>

 Phillipson in <i>The Journal of the Society of
Comparative Legislation</i>, New Series, IX. (1908), pp. 281-304.</p></div>
<p>The distinction between the natural Law of Nations,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
chiefly treated by Grotius, and the customary or voluntary
Law of Nations, chiefly treated by Zouche,<a id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_77_77">[77]</a> gave
rise in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries to
three different schools<a id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_78_78">[78]</a> of writers on the Law of Nations—namely,
the "Naturalists," the "Positivists," and
the "Grotians."</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_77_77"></a><a href="#FNanchor_77_77" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[77]</span></a> It should be mentioned that already before Zouche, another
Englishman, John Selden, in his "De jure naturali et gentium secundum
disciplinam ebraeorum" (1640), recognised the importance of the positive
Law of Nations. The successor of Zouche as a Judge of the Admiralty
Court, Sir Leoline Jenkins (1625-1684) ought also to be mentioned. His
opinions concerning questions of maritime law, and in especial prize
law, were of the greatest importance for the development of maritime
international law. See Wynne, "Life of Sir Leoline Jenkins," 2 vols.
(1740).</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_78_78"></a><a href="#FNanchor_78_78" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[78]</span></a> These three schools of writers must not be confounded with
the division of the present international jurists into the diplomatic
and legal schools; see
 above, § <a href="#The_fifth_moral5of51" class="pginternal">51, No. 5</a>.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>The Naturalists.</p></div>
<p>§ 55. "Naturalists," or "Deniers of the Law of
Nations," is the appellation of those writers who deny
that there is any positive Law of Nations whatever as
the outcome of custom or treaties, and who maintain
that all Law of Nations is only a part of the Law of
Nature. The leader of the Naturalists is Samuel Pufendorf
(1632-1694), who occupied the first chair which
was founded for the Law of Nature and Nations at a
University—namely, that at Heidelberg. Among the
many books written by Pufendorf, three are of importance
for the science of International Law:—(1)
"Elementa jurisprudentiae universalis," 1666; (2)
"De jure naturae et gentium," 1672; (3) "De officio
hominis et civis juxta legem naturalem," 1673. Starting
from the assertion of Hobbes, "De Cive," XIV. 4,
that Natural Law is to be divided into Natural Law
of individuals and of States, and that the latter is the
Law of Nations, Pufendorf<a id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_79_79">[79]</a> adds that outside this
Natural Law of Nations no voluntary or positive Law
of Nations exists which has the force of real law (<i>quod
quidem legis proprie dictae vim habeat, quae gentes tamquam
a superiore profecta stringat</i>).</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_79_79"></a><a href="#FNanchor_79_79" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[79]</span></a> De jure naturae et gentium, II. c. 3, § 22.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p></div>
<p>The most celebrated follower of Pufendorf is the
German philosopher, Christian Thomasius (1655-1728),
who published in 1688 his "Institutiones jurisprudentiae
divinae," and in 1705 his "Fundamenta juris
naturae et gentium." Of English Naturalists may be
mentioned Francis Hutcheson ("System of Moral
Philosophy," 1755) and Thomas Rutherford ("Institutes
of Natural Law; being the Substance of a Course
of Lectures on Grotius read in St. John's College, Cambridge,"
2 vols. 1754-1756). Jean Barbeyrac (1674-1744),
the learned French translator and commentator
of the works of Grotius, Pufendorf, and others, and,
further, Jean Jacques Burlamaqui (1694-1748), a
native of Geneva, who wrote the "Principes du
droit de la nature et des gens," ought likewise to be
mentioned.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>The Positivists.</p></div>
<p>§ 56. The "Positivists" are the antipodes of the
Naturalists. They include all those writers who, in
contradistinction to Hobbes and Pufendorf, not only
defend the existence of a positive Law of Nations as
the outcome of custom or international treaties, but
consider it more important than the natural Law of
Nations, the very existence of which some of the Positivists
deny, thus going beyond Zouche. The positive
writers had not much influence in the seventeenth
century, during which the Naturalists and the Grotians
carried the day, but their time came in the eighteenth
century.</p>
<p>Of seventeenth-century writers, the Germans Rachel
and Textor must be mentioned. Rachel published in
1676 his two dissertations, "De jure naturae et gentium,"
in which he defines the Law of Nations as the law to
which a plurality of free States are subjected, and
which comes into existence through tacit or express
consent of these States (<i>Jus plurium liberalium gentium
pacto sive placito expressim aut tacite initum, quo utilitatis<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
gratia sibi in vicem obligantur</i>). Textor published
in 1680 his "Synopsis juris gentium."</p>
<p>In the eighteenth century the leading Positivists,
Bynkershoek, Moser, and Martens, gained an enormous
influence.</p>
<p>Cornelius van Bynkershoek<a id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_80_80">[80]</a> (1673-1743), a celebrated
Dutch jurist, never wrote a treatise on the Law
of Nations, but gained fame through three books dealing
with different parts of this Law. He published in
1702 "De dominio maris," in 1721 "De foro legatorum,"
in 1737 "Quaestionum juris publici libri II."
According to Bynkershoek the basis of the Law of
Nations is the common consent of the nations which
finds its expression either in international custom or in
international treaties.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_80_80"></a><a href="#FNanchor_80_80" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[80]</span></a> See
 Phillipson in <i>The Journal of the Society of
Comparative Legislation</i>, New Series, IX. (1908), pp. 27-49.</p></div>
<p>Johann Jakob Moser (1701-1785), a German Professor
of Law, published many books concerning the
Law of Nations, of which three must be mentioned:
(1) "Grundsätze des jetzt üblichen Völkerrechts in
Friedenszeiten," 1750; (2) "Grundsätze des jetzt
üblichen Völkerrechts in Kriegszeiten," 1752; (3)
"Versuch des neuesten europäischen Völkerrechts in
Friedens- und Kriegszeiten," 1777-1780. Moser's books
are magazines of an enormous number of facts which
are of the greatest value for the positive Law of Nations.
Moser never fights against the Naturalists, but he is
totally indifferent towards the natural Law of Nations,
since to him the Law of Nations is positive law only
and based on international custom and treaties.</p>
<p>Georg Friedrich von Martens (1756-1821), Professor
of Law in the University of Göttingen, also published
many books concerning the Law of Nations. The most
important is his "Précis du droit des gens moderne
de l'Europe," published in 1789, of which William<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
Cobbett published in 1795 at Philadelphia an English
translation, and of which as late as 1864 appeared a
new edition at Paris with notes by Charles Vergé.
Martens began the celebrated collection of treaties
which goes under the title "Martens, Recueil des
Traités," and is continued to our days.<a id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_81_81">[81]</a> The influence
of Martens was great, and even at the present time is
considerable. He is not an exclusive Positivist, since
he does not deny the existence of natural Law of Nations,
and since he sometimes refers to the latter in case he
finds a gap in the positive Law of Nations. But his
interest is in the positive Law of Nations, which he
builds up historically on international custom and
treaties.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_81_81"></a><a href="#FNanchor_81_81" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[81]</span></a> Georg Friedrich von Martens is not to be confounded with
his nephew Charles de Martens, the author of the "Causes célèbres de
droit des gens" and of the "Guide diplomatique."</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>The Grotians.</p></div>
<p>§ 57. The "Grotians" stand midway between the
Naturalists and the Positivists. They keep up the distinction
of Grotius between the natural and the voluntary
Law of Nations, but, in contradistinction to
Grotius, they consider the positive or voluntary of
equal importance to the natural, and they devote,
therefore, their interest to both alike. Grotius's influence
was so enormous that the majority of the authors
of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were
Grotians, but only two of them have acquired a European
reputation—namely, Wolff and Vattel.</p>
<p>Christian Wolff (1679-1754), a German philosopher
who was first Professor of Mathematics and Philosophy
in the Universities of Halle and Marburg and afterwards
returned to Halle as Professor of the Law of
Nature and Nations, was seventy years of age when,
in 1749, he published his "Jus gentium methodo scientifica
pertractatum." In 1750 followed his "Institutiones
juris naturae et gentium." Wolff's conception
of the Law of Nations is influenced by his
conception<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
of the <i>civitas gentium maxima</i>. The fact that there is
a Family of Nations in existence is strained by Wolff
into the doctrine that the totality of the States forms
a world-State above the component member States, the
so-called <i>civitas gentium maxima</i>. He distinguishes four
different kinds of Law of Nations—namely, the natural,
the voluntary, the customary, and that which is expressly
created by treaties. The latter two kinds are
alterable, and have force only between those single
States between which custom and treaties have created
them. But the natural and the voluntary Law of
Nations are both eternal, unchangeable, and universally
binding upon all the States. In contradistinction
to Grotius, who calls the customary Law of Nations
"voluntary," Wolff names "voluntary" those rules of
the Law of Nations which are, according to his opinion,
tacitly imposed by the <i>civitas gentium maxima</i>, the
world-State, upon the member States.</p>
<p>Emerich de Vattel<a id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_82_82">[82]</a> (1714-1767), a Swiss from
Neuchâtel, who entered into the service of Saxony and
became her Minister at Berne, did not in the main intend
any original work, but undertook the task of introducing
Wolff's teachings concerning the Law of Nations
into the courts of Europe and to the diplomatists. He
published in 1758 his book, "Le droit des gens, ou
principes de la loi naturelle appliqués à la conduite et
aux affaires des Nations et des Souverains." But it
must be specially mentioned that Vattel expressly
rejects Wolff's conception of the <i>civitas gentium maxima</i>
in the preface to his book. Numerous editions of
Vattel's book have appeared, and as late as 1863 Pradier-Fodéré
re-edited it at Paris. An English translation
by Chitty appeared in 1834 and went through several
editions. His influence was very great, and in diplomatic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
circles his book still enjoys an unshaken
authority.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>The Science of the Law of Nations in the Nineteenth and
Twentieth Centuries as represented by treatises.</p></div>
<p>§ 59. The Science of the Law of Nations, as left by
the French Revolution, developed progressively during
the nineteenth century under the influence of three
factors. The first factor is the endeavour, on the
whole sincere, of the Powers since the Congress of Vienna
to submit to the rules of the Law of Nations. The
second factor is the many law-making treaties which
arose during this century. And the last, but not indeed
the least factor, is the downfall of the theory of the Law
of Nature, which after many hundreds of years has at
last been shaken off during the second half of this
century.</p>
<p>When the nineteenth century opens, the three schools
of the Naturalists, the Positivists, and the Grotians are
still in the field, but Positivism<a id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_84_84">[84]</a> gains slowly and
gradually the upper hand, until at the end it may be
said to be victorious, without, however, being omnipotent.
The most important writer<a id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_85_85">[85]</a> up to 1836 is
Klüber, who may be called a Positivist in the same
sense as Martens, for he also applies the natural Law
of Nations to fill up the gaps of the positive. Wheaton
appears in 1836 with his "Elements," and, although an
American, at once attracts the attention of the whole
of Europe. He may be called a Grotian. And the
same may be maintained of Manning, whose treatise
appeared in 1839, and is the first that attempts a survey
of British practice regarding sea warfare based on the
judgments of Sir William Scott (Lord Stowell). Heffter,
whose book appeared in 1844, is certainly a Positivist,
although he does not absolutely deny the Law of Nature.
In exact application of the juristic method, Heffter's
book excels all former ones, and all the following authors<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
are in a sense standing on his shoulders. In Phillimore,
Great Britain sends in 1854 a powerful author into the
arena, who may, on the whole, be called a Positivist of
the same kind as Martens and Klüber. Generations to
come will consult Phillimore's volumes on account of
the vast amount of material they contain and the sound
judgment they exhibit. And the same is valid with
regard to Sir Travers Twiss, whose first volume appeared
in 1861. Halleck's work, which appeared in
the same year, is of special importance as regards war,
because the author, who was a General in the service
of the United States, gave to this part his special attention.
The next prominent author, the Italian Fiore,
who published his system in 1865 and may be called a
Grotian, is certainly the most prominent Italian author,
and the new edition of his work will for a long time to
come be consulted. Bluntschli, the celebrated Swiss-German
author, published his book in 1867; it must,
in spite of the world-wide fame of its author, be consulted
with caution, because it contains many rules
which are not yet recognised rules of the Law of Nations.
Calvo's work, which first appeared in 1868, contains an
invaluable store of facts and opinions, but its juristic
basis is not very exact.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_84_84"></a><a href="#FNanchor_84_84" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[84]</span></a> Austin and his followers who hold that the rules of
International Law are rules of "positive morality" must be considered
Positivists, although they do not agree to International Law being real
law.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_85_85"></a><a href="#FNanchor_85_85" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[85]</span></a> I do not intend to discuss the merits of writers on special
subjects, and I mention only the authors of the most important treatises
which are written in, or translated into, English, French, or German.</p></div>
<p>From the seventies of the nineteenth century the
influence of the downfall of the theory of the Law of
Nature becomes visible in the treatises on the Law of
Nations, and therefore real positivistic treatises make
their appearance. For the Positivism of Zouche,
Bynkershoek, Martens, Klüber, Heffter, Phillimore, and
Twiss was no real Positivism, since these authors recognised
a natural Law of Nations, although they did not
make much use of it. Real Positivism must entirely
avoid a natural Law of Nations. We know nowadays
that a Law of Nature does not exist. Just as the so-called
Natural Philosophy had to give way to real<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
natural science, so the Law of Nature had to give way
to jurisprudence, or the philosophy of the positive law.
Only a positive Law of Nations can be a branch of the
science of law.</p>
<p>The first real positive treatise known to me is Hartmann's
"Institutionen des praktischen Völkerrechts in
Friedenszeiten," which appeared in 1874, but is hardly
known outside Germany. In 1880 Hall's treatise appeared,
and at once won the attention of the whole
world; it is one of the best books on the Law of
Nations that have ever been written. Lorimer, whose
two volumes appeared in 1883 and 1884, is a Naturalist
pure and simple, but his work is nevertheless
of value. The Russian Martens, whose two volumes
appeared in German and French translations in 1883
and at once put their author in the forefront of
the authorities, certainly intends to be a real Positivist,
but traces of Natural Law are nevertheless
now and then to be found in his book. A work of a
special kind is that of Holtzendorff, the first volume
of which appeared in 1885. Holtzendorff himself is the
editor and at the same time a contributor to the work,
but there are many other contributors, each of them
dealing exhaustively with a different part of the Law
of Nations. The copious work of Pradier-Fodéré,
which also began to appear in 1885, is far from being
positive, although it has its merits. Wharton's three
volumes, which appeared in 1886, are not a treatise,
but contain the international practice of the United
States. Bulmerincq's book, which appeared in 1887,
gives a good survey of International Law from the
positive point of view. In 1894 three French jurists,
Bonfils, Despagnet, and Piédelievre, step into the arena;
their treatises are comprehensive and valuable, but not
absolutely positive. On the other hand, the English
authors Lawrence and Walker, whose excellent manuals<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
appeared in 1895, are real Positivists. Of the greatest
value are the two volumes of Rivier which appeared
in 1896; they are full of sound judgment, and will
influence the theory and practice of International Law
for a long time to come. Liszt's short manual, which
in its first edition made its appearance in 1898, is positive
throughout, well written, and suggestive. Ullmann's
work, which likewise appeared in its first edition
in 1898, is an excellent and comprehensive treatise
which thoroughly discusses all the more important
problems and points from the positive standpoint.
Hannis Taylor's comprehensive treatise, which appeared
in 1901, is likewise thoroughly positive, and
so are the serviceable manuals of Wilson and Maxey.
Of great value are the two volumes of Westlake which
appeared in 1904 and 1907; they represent rather
a collection of thorough monographs than a treatise,
and will have great and lasting influence. A work
of particular importance is the "Digest" of John
Basset Moore, which appeared in 1906, comprises
eight volumes, and contains the international practice
of the United States in a much more exhaustive form
than the work of Wharton; it is an invaluable work
which must be consulted on every subject. The same
is valid with regard to the three volumes of Nys, who
may be characterised as a Grotian, and whose work is
full of information on the historical and literary side
of the problems.<a id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_86_86">[86]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Real and apparent International Persons.</p></div>
<p>§ 63. <a id="Th63"></a>The conception of International Persons is
derived from the conception of the Law of Nations.
As this law is the body of rules which the civilised
States consider legally binding in their intercourse,
every State which belongs to the civilised States, and
is, therefore, a member of the Family of Nations, is
an International Person. Sovereign States exclusively
are International Persons—<i>i.e.</i> subjects of International
Law. There are, however, as will be seen, full and
not-full Sovereign States. Full Sovereign States are
perfect, not-full Sovereign States are imperfect International
Persons, for not-full Sovereign States are for
some parts only subjects of International Law.</p>
<p>In contradistinction to Sovereign States which are
real, there are also apparent, but not real, International
Persons—namely, Confederations of States, insurgents
recognised as a belligerent Power in a civil war, and the
Holy See. All these are not, as will be seen,<a id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_87_87">[87]</a> real<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
subjects of International Law, but in some points are
treated as though they were International Persons,
without thereby becoming members of the Family of
Nations.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_87_87"></a><a href="#FNanchor_87_87" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[87]</span></a> See
below, § <a href="#Confederated_States88" class="pginternal">88</a> (Confederations of States),
 § <a href="#The_Law_of_Guaranty106" class="pginternal">106</a> (Holy See),

<p>It must be specially mentioned that the character
of a subject of the Law of Nations and of an International
Person can be attributed neither to monarchs,
diplomatic envoys, private individuals, or churches,
nor to chartered companies, nations, or races after the
loss of their State (as, for instance, the Jews or the
Poles), and organised wandering tribes.<a id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_88_88">[88]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_88_88"></a><a href="#FNanchor_88_88" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[88]</span></a> Most jurists agree with this opinion, but there are some
who disagree. Thus, for instance, Heffter (§ 48) claims for monarchs the
character of subjects of the Law of Nations; Lawrence (§ 42) claims that
character for corporations; and Westlake, Chapters, p. 2, and Fiore,
Code, Nos. 51, 61-64, claim it for individuals. The matter will be
discussed
 below in §§ <a href="#Page_288" class="pginternal">288</a>,

<div class="sidenote"><p>Conception
of the
State.</p></div>
<p>§ 64. A State proper—in contradistinction to so-called
Colonial States—is in existence when a people
is settled in a country under its own Sovereign Government.
The conditions which must obtain for the
existence of a State are therefore four:</p>
<p>There must, first, be a <i>people</i>. A people is an
aggregate of individuals of both sexes who live together
as a community in spite of the fact that they
may belong to different races or creeds, or be of different
colour.</p>
<p>There must, secondly, be a <i>country</i> in which the
people has settled down. A wandering people, such as
the Jews were whilst in the desert for forty years before
their conquest of the Holy Land, is not a State. But
it matters not whether the country is small or large;
it may consist, as with City States, of one town only.</p>
<p>There must, thirdly, be a <i>Government</i>—that is, one
or more persons who are the representatives of the
people and rule according to the law of the land. An
anarchistic community is not a State.</p>
<p>There must, fourthly and lastly, be a <i>Sovereign</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
Government. Sovereignty is supreme authority, an
authority which is independent of any other earthly
authority. Sovereignty in the strict and narrowest
sense of the term includes, therefore, independence all
round, within and without the borders of the country.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Not-full Sovereign States.</p></div>
<p>§ 65. A State in its normal appearance does possess
independence all round and therefore full sovereignty.
Yet there are States in existence which certainly do
not possess full sovereignty, and are therefore named
not-full Sovereign States. All States which are under
the suzerainty or under the protectorate of another
State or are member States of a so-called Federal State,
belong to this group. All of them possess supreme
authority and independence with regard to a part of
the tasks of a State, whereas with regard to another
part they are under the authority of another State.
Hence it is that the question is disputed whether such
not-full Sovereign States can be International Persons
and subjects of the Law of Nations at all.<a id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_89_89">[89]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_89_89"></a><a href="#FNanchor_89_89" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[89]</span></a> The question will be discussed again
 below, §§ <a href="#A_Federal89" class="pginternal">89</a>,
 <a href="#Th91" class="pginternal">91</a>,
 <a href="#The_position_of_a_State93" class="pginternal">93</a>,
with regard to each kind of not-full Sovereign States. The object of
discussion here is the question whether such States can be considered as
International Persons at all. Westlake, I. p. 21, answers it
affirmatively by stating: "It is not necessary for a State to be
independent in order to be a State of International Law."</p></div>
<p>That they cannot be full, perfect, and normal subjects
of International Law there is no doubt. But it
is wrong to maintain that they can have no international
position whatever and can never be members of the
Family of Nations at all. If we look at the matter as
it really stands, we observe that they actually often
enjoy in many points the rights and fulfil in other points
the duties of International Persons. They often send
and receive diplomatic envoys or at least consuls. They
often conclude commercial or other international treaties.
Their monarchs enjoy the privileges which according to
the Law of Nations the Municipal Laws of the different
States must grant to the monarchs of foreign States.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
No other explanation of these and similar facts can be
given except that these not-full Sovereign States are
in some way or another International Persons and
subjects of International Law. Such imperfect International
Personality is, of course, an anomaly; but the
very existence of States without full sovereignty is an
anomaly in itself. And history teaches that States
without full sovereignty have no durability, since they
either gain in time full sovereignty or disappear totally
as separate States and become mere provinces of other
States. So anomalous are these not-full Sovereign
States that no hard-and-fast general rule can be laid
down with regard to their position within the Family
of Nations, since everything depends upon the special
case. What may be said in general concerning all the
States without full sovereignty is that their position
within the Family of Nations, if any, is always more
or less overshadowed by other States. But their partial
character of International Persons comes clearly to light
when they are compared with so-called Colonial States,
such as the Dominion of Canada or the Commonwealth
of Australia. Colonial States have no international
position<a id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_90_90">[90]</a> whatever; they are, from the standpoint of
the Law of Nations, nothing else than colonial portions
of the mother-country, although they enjoy perfect
self-government, and may therefore in a sense be called
States. The deciding factor is that their Governor,
who has a veto, is appointed by the mother-country, and
that the Parliament of the mother-country could withdraw
self-government from its Colonial States and
legislate directly for them.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_90_90"></a><a href="#FNanchor_90_90" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[90]</span></a> Therefore treaties concluded by Canada with foreign States
are not Canadian treaties, but treaties concluded by Great Britain for
Canada. Should Colonial States ever acquire the right to conclude
treaties directly with foreign States without the consent of the
mother-country, they would become internationally part-sovereign and
thereby obtain a certain international position.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Divisibility of Sovereignty contested.</p></div>
<p>§ 66. The distinction between States full Sovereign<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
and not-full Sovereign is based upon the opinion that
sovereignty is divisible, so that the powers connected
with sovereignty need not necessarily be united in one
hand. But many jurists deny the divisibility of sovereignty
and maintain that a State is either sovereign or
not. They deny that sovereignty is a characteristic of
every State and of the membership of the Family of
Nations. It is therefore necessary to face the conception
of sovereignty more closely. And it will be
seen that there exists perhaps no conception the meaning
of which is more controversial than that of sovereignty.
It is an indisputable fact that this conception,
from the moment when it was introduced into political
science until the present day, has never had a meaning
which was universally agreed upon.<a id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_91_91">[91]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_91_91"></a><a href="#FNanchor_91_91" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[91]</span></a> The literature upon sovereignty is extensive. The following
authors give a survey of the opinions of the different
writers:—Dock,"Der Souveränitäts-begriff von Bodin bis zu Friedrich dem
Grossen," 1897; Merriam, "History of the Theory of Sovereignty since
Rousseau," 1900; Rehm, "Allgemeine Staatslehre," 1899, §§ 10-16. See
also Maine, "Early Institutions," pp. 342-400.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Meaning of Sovereignty in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth
Centuries.</p></div>
<p>§ 67. The term Sovereignty was introduced into
political science by Bodin in his celebrated work, "De
la république," which appeared in 1577. Before Bodin,
at the end of the Middle Ages, the word <i>souverain</i><a id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_92_92">[92]</a> was
used in France for an authority, political or other, which
had no other authority above itself. Thus the highest
courts were called <i>Cours Souverains</i>. Bodin, however,
gave quite a new meaning to the old conception. Being
under the influence and in favour of the policy of centralisation
initiated by Louis XI. of France (1461-1483),
the founder of French absolutism, he defined sovereignty
as "the absolute and perpetual power within a State."
Such power is the supreme power within a State without
any restriction whatever except the Commandments
of God and the Law of Nature. No constitution
can limit sovereignty, which is an attribute of the king<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
in a monarchy and of the people in a democracy. A
Sovereign is above positive law. A contract only is
binding upon the Sovereign, because the Law of Nature
commands that a contract shall be binding.<a id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_93_93">[93]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_92_92"></a><a href="#FNanchor_92_92" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[92]</span></a> <i>Souverain</i> is derived either from the Latin <i>superanus</i> or
from <i>suprema potestas</i>.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_93_93"></a><a href="#FNanchor_93_93" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[93]</span></a> See
 Bodin, "De la république," I. c. 8.</p></div>
<p>The conception of sovereignty thus introduced was
at once accepted by writers on politics of the sixteenth
century, but the majority of these writers taught that
sovereignty could be restricted by a constitution and
by positive law. Thus at once a somewhat weaker
conception of sovereignty than that of Bodin made its
appearance. On the other hand, in the seventeenth
century, Hobbes went even beyond Bodin, maintaining<a id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_94_94">[94]</a>
that a Sovereign was not bound by anything and had
a right over everything, even over religion. Whereas a
good many publicists followed Hobbes, others, especially
Pufendorf, denied, in contradistinction to Hobbes, that
sovereignty includes omnipotence. According to Pufendorf,
sovereignty is the supreme power in a State, but
not absolute power, and sovereignty may well be constitutionally
restricted.<a id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_95_95">[95]</a> Yet in spite of all the differences
in defining sovereignty, all authors of the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries agree that sovereignty is
indivisible and contains the centralisation of all power
in the hands of the Sovereign, whether a monarch or
the people itself in a republic. Yet the way for another
conception of sovereignty is prepared by Locke, whose
"Two Treatises on Government" appeared in 1689,
and paved the way for the doctrine that the State itself
is the original Sovereign, and that all supreme powers
of the Government are derived from this sovereignty
of the State.</p>

1-13.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Meaning of Sovereignty in the Eighteenth Century.</p></div>
<p>§ 68. In the eighteenth century matters changed
again. The fact that the several hundred reigning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
princes of the member-States of the German Empire
had practically, although not theoretically, become
more or less independent since the Westphalian Peace
enforced the necessity upon publicists to recognise
a distinction between an absolute, perfect, full sovereignty,
on the one hand, and, on the other, a relative,
imperfect, not-full or half-sovereignty. Absolute and
full sovereignty was attributed to those monarchs who
enjoyed an unqualified independence within and without
their States. Relative and not-full sovereignty, or
half-sovereignty, was attributed to those monarchs who
were, in various points of internal or foreign affairs of
State, more or less dependent upon other monarchs.
By this distinction the divisibility of sovereignty was
recognised. And when in 1787 the United States of
America turned from a Confederation of States into a
Federal State, the division of sovereignty between the
Sovereign Federal State and the Sovereign member-States
appeared. But it cannot be maintained that
divisibility of sovereignty was universally recognised in
the eighteenth century. It suffices to mention Rousseau,
whose "Contrat Social" appeared in 1762 and
defended again the indivisibility of sovereignty. Rousseau's
conception of sovereignty is essentially that of
Hobbes, since it contains absolute supreme power, but
he differs from Hobbes in so far as, according to Rousseau,
sovereignty belongs to the people only and exclusively,
is inalienable, and therefore cannot be transferred
from the people to any organ of the State.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Meaning of Sovereignty in the Nineteenth Century.</p></div>
<p>§ 69. During the nineteenth century three different
factors of great practical importance have exercised
their influence on the history of the conception of
sovereignty.</p>
<p>The first factor is that, with the exception of Russia,
all civilised Christian monarchies during this period
turned into constitutional monarchies. Thus identification<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
of sovereignty with absolutism belongs practically
to the past, and the fact was during the nineteenth
century generally recognised that a sovereign monarch
may well be restricted in the exercise of his powers by
a Constitution and positive law.</p>
<p>The second factor is, that the example of a Federal
State set by the United States has been followed by
Switzerland, Germany, and others. The Constitution
of Switzerland as well as that of Germany declares
decidedly that the member-States of the Federal State
remain Sovereign States, thus indirectly recognising the
divisibility of sovereignty between the member-States
and the Federal State according to different matters.</p>
<p>The third and most important factor is, that the
science of politics has learned to distinguish between
sovereignty of the State and sovereignty of the organ
which exercises the powers of the State. The majority
of publicists teach henceforth that neither the monarch,
nor Parliament, nor the people is originally Sovereign
in a State, but the State itself. Sovereignty, we say
nowadays, is a natural attribute of every State as a
State. But a State, as a Juristic Person, wants organs
to exercise its powers. The organ or organs which
exercise for the State powers connected with sovereignty
are said to be sovereign themselves, yet it is obvious
that this sovereignty of the organ is derived from the
sovereignty of the State. And it is likewise obvious
that the sovereignty of a State may be exercised by the
combined action of several organs, as, for instance, in
Great Britain, King and Parliament are the joint administrators
of the sovereignty of the State. And it is,
thirdly, obvious that a State can, as regards certain
matters, have its sovereignty exercised by one organ
and as regards other matters by another organ.</p>
<p>In spite of this condition of things, the old controversy
regarding divisibility of sovereignty has by no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
means died out. It acquired a fresh stimulus, on the
one hand, through Switzerland and Germany turning
into Federal States, and, on the other, through the
conflict between the United States of America and her
Southern member-States. The theory of the concurrent
sovereignty of the Federal State and its member-States,
as defended by "The Federalist" (Alexander
Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay) in 1787, was
in Germany taken up by Waitz,<a id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_96_96">[96]</a> whom numerous
publicists followed. The theory of the indivisibility
of sovereignty was defended by Calhoun,<a id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_97_97">[97]</a> and many
European publicists followed him in time.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Result of the Controversy regarding Sovereignty.</p></div>
<p>§ 70. From the foregoing sketch of the history of
the conception of sovereignty it becomes apparent that
there is not and never was unanimity regarding this
conception. It is therefore no wonder that the endeavour
has been made to eliminate the conception of
sovereignty from the science of politics altogether, and
likewise to eliminate sovereignty as a necessary characteristic
of statehood, so that States with and without
sovereignty would in consequence be distinguishable.
It is a fact that sovereignty is a term used without any
well-recognised meaning except that of supreme authority.
Under these circumstances those who do not want
to interfere in a mere scholastic controversy must cling
to the facts of life and the practical, though abnormal
and illogical, condition of affairs. As there can be no
doubt about the fact that there are semi-independent
States in existence, it may well be maintained that
sovereignty is divisible.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

common consent of the civilised States, statehood alone
does not include membership of the Family of Nations.
There are States in existence, although their number
decreases gradually, which are not, or not fully, members
of that family, because their civilisation, if any,
does not enable them and their subjects to act in
conformity with the principles of International Law.
Those States which are members are either original
members because the Law of Nations grew up gradually
between them through custom and treaties, or
they are members which have been recognised by the

with other States. Yet they assert that theoretically
every new State becomes a member of the
Family of Nations <i>ipso facto</i> by its rising into existence,
and that recognition supplies only the necessary evidence
for this fact.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_99_99"></a><a href="#FNanchor_99_99" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[99]</span></a> See,
 for instance, Hall, §§ 2 and 26; Ullmann, § 29;
Gareis, p. 64; Rivier, I. p. 57.</p></div>
<p>If the real facts of international life are taken into
consideration, this opinion cannot stand. It is a rule
of International Law that no new State has a right
towards other States to be recognised by them, and
that no State has the duty to recognise a new State.
It is generally agreed that a new State before its recognition
cannot claim any right which a member of the
Family of Nations has towards other members. It can,
therefore, not be seen what the function of recognition
could be if a State entered at its birth really of right
into the membership of the Family of Nations. There
is no doubt that statehood itself is independent of recognition.
International Law does not say that a State
is not in existence as long as it is not recognised, but it
takes no notice of it before its recognition. Through
recognition only and exclusively a State becomes an
International Person and a subject of International Law.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Mode of
Recognition.</p></div>
<p>§ 72. <a id="Recognition_is_the_act72"></a>Recognition is the act through which it becomes
apparent that an old State is ready to deal with
a new State as an International Person and a member
of the Family of Nations. Recognition is given either
expressly or tacitly. If a new State asks formally for
recognition and receives it in a formal declaration of
any kind, it receives express recognition. On the other
hand, recognition is tacitly and indirectly given when
an old State enters officially into intercourse with the
new, be it by sending or receiving a diplomatic envoy,<a id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_100_100">[100]</a>
or <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>by concluding a treaty, or by any other act through
which it becomes apparent that the new State is actually
treated as an International Person.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_100_100"></a><a href="#FNanchor_100_100" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[100]</span></a> Whether the sending of a consul includes recognition is
discussed below, § 428.</p></div>
<p>But no new State has by International Law a right
to demand recognition, although practically such recognition
cannot in the long run be withheld, because
without it there is no possibility of entering into intercourse
with the new State. The interests of the old
States must suffer quite as much as those of the new
State, if recognition is for any length of time refused,
and practically these interests in time enforce either
express or tacit recognition. History nevertheless records
many cases of deferred recognition,<a id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_101_101">[101]</a> and, apart
from other proof, it becomes thereby apparent that
the granting or the denial of recognition is not a
matter of International Law but of international
policy.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_101_101"></a><a href="#FNanchor_101_101" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[101]</span></a> See
 the cases enumerated by Rivier, I. p. 58.</p></div>
<p>It must be specially mentioned that recognition by
one State is not at all binding upon other States, so
that they must follow suit. But in practice such an
example, if set by one or more Great Powers and at a
time when the new State is really established on a sound
basis, will make many other States at a later period
give their recognition too.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Recognition under Conditions.</p></div>
<p>§ 73. <a id="Recognition_will73"></a>Recognition will as a rule be given without
any conditions whatever, provided the new State is
safely and permanently established. Since, however,
the granting of recognition is a matter of policy, and
not of law, nothing prevents an old State from making
the recognition of a new State dependent upon the
latter fulfilling certain conditions. Thus the Powers
assembled at the Berlin Congress in 1878 recognised
Bulgaria, Montenegro, Servia, and Roumania under the
condition only that these States did not<a id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_102_102">[102]</a> impose any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
religious disabilities on any of their subjects.<a id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_103_103">[103]</a> The
meaning of such conditional recognition is not that
recognition can be withdrawn in case the condition is
not complied with. The nature of the thing makes
recognition, if once given, incapable of withdrawal.
But conditional recognition, if accepted by the new
State, imposes the internationally legal duty upon such
State of complying with the condition; failing which a
right of intervention is given to the other party for the
purpose of making the recognised State comply with
the imposed condition.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_102_102"></a><a href="#FNanchor_102_102" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[102]</span></a> This condition contains a restriction on the personal
supremacy of the respective States. See
 below, § <a href="#Personal_Supremacy_does_not128" class="pginternal">128</a>.</p></div>

1878, in Martens, N.R.G. 2nd Ser. III. p. 449.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Recognition timely and precipitate.</p></div>
<p>§ 74. Recognition is of special importance in those
cases where a new State tries to establish itself by
breaking off from an existing State in the course of a
revolution. And here the question is material whether
a new State has really already safely and permanently
established itself or only makes efforts to this end
without having already succeeded. That in every case
of civil war a foreign State can recognise the insurgents
as a belligerent Power if they succeed in keeping a part
of the country in their hands and set up a Government
of their own, there is no doubt. But between this
recognition as a belligerent Power and the recognition
of these insurgents and their part of the country as a
new State, there is a broad and deep gulf. And the
question is precisely at what exact time recognition of
a new State may be given instead of the recognition as
a belligerent Power. For an untimely and precipitate
recognition as a new State is a violation of the dignity<a id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_104_104">[104]</a>
of the mother-State, to which the latter need not patiently
submit.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_104_104"></a><a href="#FNanchor_104_104" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[104]</span></a> It is frequently maintained that such untimely recognition
contains an intervention. But this is not correct, since intervention is
(see
 below, § <a href="#Intervention_is134" class="pginternal">134</a>) <i>dictatorial</i> interference in the affairs of another
State. The question of recognition of the belligerency of insurgents is
exhaustively treated by Westlake, I. pp. 50-57.</p></div>
<p>In spite of the importance of the question, no hard-and-fast rule<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
can be laid down as regards the time
when it can be said that a State created by revolution
has established itself safely and permanently. The
characteristic of such safe and permanent establishment
may be found either in the fact that the revolutionary
State has utterly defeated the mother-State, or that
the mother-State has ceased to make efforts to subdue
the revolutionary State, or even that the mother-State,
in spite of its efforts, is apparently incapable of bringing
the revolutionary back under its sway.<a id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_105_105">[105]</a> Of course, as
soon as the mother-State itself recognises the new
State, there is no reason for other States to withhold
any longer their recognition, although they have even
then no legal obligation to grant it.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_105_105"></a><a href="#FNanchor_105_105" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[105]</span></a> When, in 1903, Panama fell away from Colombia, the United
States immediately recognised the new Republic as an independent State.
For the motives of this quick action, see Moore, I. § 344, pp. 46 and
following.</p></div>
<p>The breaking off of the American States from their
European mother-States furnishes many illustrative examples.
Thus the recognition of the United States by
France in 1778 was precipitate. But when in 1782
England herself recognised the independence of the
United States, other States could accord recognition
too without giving offence to England. Again, when
the South American colonies of Spain declared their
independence in 1810, no Power recognised the new
States for many years. When, however, it became
apparent that Spain, although she still kept up her
claims, was not able to restore her sway, the United
States recognised the new States in 1822, and England
followed the example in 1824 and 1825.<a id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_106_106">[106]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>State Recognition in contradistinction to other
Recognitions.</p></div>
<p>§ 75. Recognition of a new State must not be
confounded with other recognitions. Recognition of
insurgents as a belligerent Power has already been
mentioned. Besides this, recognition of a change in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
form of the government or of change in the title of an
old State is a matter of importance. But the granting
or refusing of these recognitions has nothing to do with
recognition of the State itself. If a foreign State
refuses the recognition of a change in the form of the
government of an old State, the latter does not thereby
lose its recognition as an International Person, although
no official intercourse is henceforth possible between
the two States as long as recognition is not given either
expressly or tacitly. And if recognition of a new title<a id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_107_107">[107]</a>
of an old State is refused, the only consequence is that
such State cannot claim any privileges connected with
the new title.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Important in contradistinction to Indifferent Changes.</p></div>
<p>§ 76. The existence of International Persons is
exposed to the flow of things and times. There is a
constant and gradual change in their citizens through
deaths and births, emigration, and immigration. There
is a frequent change in those individuals who are at
the head of the States, and there is sometimes a change
in the form of their governments, or in their dynasties
if they are monarchies. There are sometimes changes
in their territories through loss or increase of parts
thereof, and there are sometimes changes regarding
their independence through partial or total loss of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
same. Several of these and other changes in the condition
and appearance of International Persons are
indifferent to International Law, although they may
be of great importance for the inner development of
the States concerned and directly or indirectly for
international policy. Those changes, on the other hand,
which are, or may be, of importance to International
Law must be divided into three groups according to
their influence upon the character of the State concerned
as an International Person. For some of these
changes affect a State as an International Person,
others do not; again, others extinguish a State as an
International Person altogether.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Changes not affecting States as International Persons.</p></div>
<p>§ 77. A State remains one and the same International
Person in spite of changes in its headship, in its dynasty,
in its form, in its rank and title, and in its territory.
These changes cannot be said to be indifferent to International
Law. Although strictly no notification to and
recognition by foreign Powers are necessary, according
to the Law of Nations, in case of a change in the headship
of a State or in its entire dynasty, or if a monarchy
becomes a republic or <i>vice versa</i>, no official intercourse
is possible between the Powers refusing recognition
and the State concerned. Although, further, a State
can assume any title it likes, it cannot claim the privileges
of rank connected with a title if foreign States
refuse recognition. And although, thirdly, a State can
dispose according to discretion of parts of its territory
and acquire as much territory as it likes, foreign Powers
may intervene for the purpose of maintaining a balance
of power or on account of other vital interests.</p>
<p>But whatever may be the importance of such changes,
they neither affect a State as an International Person,
nor affect the personal identity of the States concerned.
France, for instance, has retained her personal identity
from the time the Law of Nations came into existence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
until the present day, although she acquired and lost
parts of her territory, changed her dynasty, was a kingdom,
a republic, an empire, again a kingdom, again
a republic, again an empire, and is now, finally as it
seems, a republic. All her international rights and
duties as an International Person remained the very
same throughout the centuries in spite of these important
changes in her condition and appearance.
Even such loss of territory as occasions the reduction
of a Great Power to a small Power, or such increase
of territory and strength as turns a small State into
a Great Power, does not affect a State as an International
Person. Thus, although through the events
of the years 1859-1861 Sardinia acquired the whole
territory of the Italian Peninsula and turned into the
Great Power of Italy, she remained one and the same
International Person.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Changes affecting States as International Persons.</p></div>
<p>§ 78. Changes which affect States as International
Persons are of different character.</p>
<p>(1) As in a Real Union the member-States of the
union, although fully independent, make one International
Person,<a id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_108_108">[108]</a> two States which hitherto were separate
International Persons are affected in that character by
entering into a Real Union. For through that change
they appear henceforth together as one and the same
International Person. And should this union be dissolved,
the member-States are again affected, for they
now become again separate International Persons.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_108_108"></a><a href="#FNanchor_108_108" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[108]</span></a> See
 below, § <a href="#A_Real87" class="pginternal">87</a>, where the character of the Real Union is
fully discussed.</p></div>
<p>(2) Other changes affecting States as International
Persons are such changes as involve a partial loss of
independence on the part of the States concerned.
Many restrictions may be imposed upon States without
interfering with their independence proper,<a id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_109_109">[109]</a> but
certain restrictions involve inevitably a partial loss of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
independence. Thus if a hitherto independent State
comes under the suzerainty of another State and becomes
thereby a half-Sovereign State, its character as
an International Person is affected. The same is valid
with regard to a hitherto independent State which comes
under the protectorate of another State. Again, if
several hitherto independent States enter into a Federal
State, they transfer a part of their sovereignty to the
Federal State and become thereby part-Sovereign States.
On the other hand, if a vassal State or a State under
protectorate is freed from the suzerainty or protectorate,
it is thereby affected as an International Person,
because it turns now into a full Sovereign State. And
the same is valid with regard to a member-State of a
Federal State which leaves the union and gains the
condition of a full Sovereign State.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_109_109"></a><a href="#FNanchor_109_109" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[109]</span></a> See
 below, §§ <a href="#Independence_is_not126" class="pginternal">126</a>-127, where the
different kinds of these restrictions
are discussed.</p></div>
<p>(3) States which become permanently neutralised
are thereby also affected in their character as International
Persons, although their independence remains
untouched. But permanent neutralisation alters the
condition of a State so much that it thereby becomes
an International Person of a particular kind.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Extinction of International Persons.</p></div>
<p>§ 79. A State ceases to be an International Person
when it ceases to exist. Theoretically such extinction
of International Persons is possible through emigration
or the perishing of the whole population of a State,
or through a permanent anarchy within a State. But
it is evident that such cases will hardly ever occur in
fact. Practical cases of extinction of States are:
Merger of one State into another, annexation after
conquest in war, breaking up of a State into several
States, and breaking up of a State into parts which
are annexed by surrounding States.</p>
<p>By voluntarily merging into another State, a State
loses all its independence and becomes a mere part of
another. In this way the Duchy of Courland merged
in 1795 into Russia, the two Principalities of Hohenzollern-Hechingen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
and Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen in
1850 into Prussia, the Congo Free State in 1908 into
Belgium, and Korea in 1910 into Japan. And the same
is the case if a State is subjugated by another. In this
way the Orange Free State and the South African Republic
were absorbed by Great Britain in 1901. An
example of the breaking up of a State into different
States is the division of the Swiss canton of Basle into
Basel-Stadt and Basel-Land in 1833. And an example
of the breaking up of a State into parts which are annexed
by surrounding States, is the absorption of
Poland by Russia, Austria, and Prussia in 1795.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Common Doctrine regarding Succession of International
Persons.</p></div>
<p>§ 80. Although there is no unanimity among the
writers on International Law with regard to the so-called
succession of International Persons, nevertheless
the following common doctrine can be stated to exist.</p>
<p>A succession of International Persons occurs when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
one or more International Persons take the place of
another International Person, in consequence of certain
changes in the latter's condition.</p>
<p>Universal succession takes place when one International
Person is absorbed by another, either through
subjugation or through voluntary merger. And universal
succession further takes place when a State
breaks up into parts which either become separate
International Persons of their own or are annexed by
surrounding International Persons.</p>
<p>Partial succession takes place, first, when a part of
the territory of an International Person breaks off in
a revolt and by winning its independence becomes itself
an International Person; secondly, when one International
Person acquires a part of the territory of another
through cession; thirdly, when a hitherto full
Sovereign State loses part of its independence through
entering into a Federal State, or coming under suzerainty
or under a protectorate, or when a hitherto not-full
Sovereign State becomes full Sovereign; fourthly, when
an International Person becomes a member of a Real
Union or <i>vice versa</i>.</p>
<p>Nobody ever maintained that on the successor devolve
all the rights and duties of his predecessor. But
after stating that a succession takes place, the respective
writers try to educe the consequences and to make
out what rights and duties do, and what do not, devolve.</p>
<p>Several writers,<a id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_111_111">[111]</a> however, contest the common doctrine
and maintain that a succession of International
Persons never takes place. Their argument is that the
rights and duties of an International Person disappear
with the extinguished Person or become modified
according to the modifications an International Person
undergoes through losing part of its sovereignty.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_111_111"></a><a href="#FNanchor_111_111" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[111]</span></a> See
 Gareis, pp. 66-70, who discusses the matter with great
clearness, and Liszt, § 23.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>How far Succession actually takes place.</p></div>
<p>§ 81. If the real facts of life are taken into consideration,
the common doctrine cannot be upheld. To
say that succession takes place in such and such cases
and to make out afterwards what rights and duties
devolve, shows a wrong method of dealing with the
problem. It is certain that no <i>general</i> succession takes
place according to the Law of Nations. With the extinction
of an International Person disappear its rights
and duties as a person. But it is equally wrong to
maintain that no succession whatever occurs. For
nobody doubts that certain rights and duties actually
and really devolve upon an International Person from
its predecessor. And since this devolution takes place
through the very fact of one International Person following
another in the possession of State territory, there
is no doubt that, as far as these devolving rights and
duties are concerned, a succession of one International
Person to the rights and duties of another really does
take place. But no general rule can be laid down concerning
all the cases in which a succession takes place.
These cases must be discussed singly.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Succession in consequence of Absorption.</p></div>
<p>§ 82. <a id="When_a_State_merges82"></a>When a State merges voluntarily into another
State—as, for instance, Korea in 1910 did into Japan—or
when a State is subjugated by another State, the
latter remains one and the same International Person
and the former becomes totally extinct as an International
Person. No succession takes place, therefore,
with regard to rights and duties of the extinct State
arising either from the character of the latter as an
International Person or from its purely political treaties.
Thus treaties of alliance or of arbitration or of neutrality
or of any other political nature fall to the ground with
the extinction of the State which concluded them.
They are personal treaties, and they naturally, legally,
and necessarily presuppose the existence of the contracting
State. But it is controversial whether treaties<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
of commerce, extradition, and the like, of the extinct
State remain valid and therefore a succession takes
place. The majority of writers correctly, I think,
answer the question in the negative, because such
treaties, although they are non-political in a sense,
possess some prominent political traits.<a id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_112_112">[112]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_112_112"></a><a href="#FNanchor_112_112" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[112]</span></a> On the whole question concerning the extinction of treaties
in consequence of the absorption of a State by another, see Moore, V. §
773, and below, § <a href="#A_cause_which548" class="pginternal">548</a>. When, in 1910, Korea merged into Japan, the
latter published a Declaration—see Martens, N.R.G. 3rd Ser. IV. p.
26—containing the following articles with regard to the treaty
obligations of the extinct State of Korea:—
</p><p>
1. Treaties hitherto concluded by Korea with foreign Powers ceasing to
be operative, Japan's existing treaties will, so far as practicable, be
applied to Korea. Foreigners resident in Korea will, so far as
conditions permit, enjoy the same rights and immunities as in Japan
proper, and the protection of their legally acquired rights subject in
all cases to the jurisdiction of Japan. The Imperial Government of Japan
is ready to consent that the jurisdiction in respect of the cases
actually pending in any foreign Consular Court in Korea at the time the
Treaty of Annexation takes effect shall remain in such Court until final
decision.
</p><p>
2. Independently of any conventional engagements formerly existing on
the subject, the Imperial Government of Japan will for a period of ten
years levy upon goods imported into Korea from foreign countries or
exported from Korea to foreign countries and upon foreign vessels
entering any of the open ports of Korea the same import or export duties
and the same tonnage dues as under the existing schedules. The same
import or export duties and tonnage dues as those to be levied upon the
aforesaid goods and vessels will also for a period of ten years be
applied in respect of goods imported into Korea from Japan or exported
from Korea to Japan and Japanese vessels entering any of the open ports
of Korea.
</p><p>
3. The Imperial Government of Japan will also permit for a period of ten
years vessels under flags of the Powers having treaties with Japan to
engage in the coasting trade between the open ports of Korea and between
those ports and any open port of Japan.
</p><p>
4. The existing open ports of Korea, with the exemption of Masampo, will
be continued as open ports, and in addition Shiwiju will be newly opened
so that vessels, foreign as well as Japanese, will there be admitted and
goods may be imported into and exported from these ports.</p></div>
<p>A real succession takes place, however, first, with
regard to such international rights and duties of the
extinct State as are locally connected with its land,
rivers, main roads, railways, and the like. According
to the principle <i>res transit cum suo onere</i>, treaties of the
extinct State concerning boundary lines, repairing of
main roads, navigation on rivers, and the like, remain
valid, and all rights and duties arising from such treaties
of the extinct State devolve on the absorbing State.</p>
<p>A real succession, secondly, takes place with regard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
to the fiscal property and the fiscal funds of the extinct
State. They both accrue to the absorbing State <i>ipso
facto</i> by the absorption of the extinct State.<a id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_113_113">[113]</a> But the
debts<a id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_114_114">[114]</a> of the extinct State must, on the other hand,
also be taken over by the absorbing State.<a id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_115_115">[115]</a> The private
creditor of an extinct State certainly acquires no right<a id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_116_116">[116]</a>
by International Law against the absorbing State, since
the Law of Nations is a law between States only and
exclusively. But if he is a foreigner, the right of protection
due to his home State enables the latter to
exercise pressure upon the absorbing State for the
purpose of making it fulfil its international duty to take
over the debts of the extinct State. Some jurists<a id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_117_117">[117]</a> go
so far as to maintain that the succeeding State must
take over the debts of the extinct State, even when
they are higher than the value of the accrued fiscal
property and fiscal funds. But I doubt whether in such
cases the practice of the States would follow that
opinion. On the other hand, a State which has subjugated
another would be compelled<a id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_118_118">[118]</a> to take over even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
such obligations as have been incurred by the annexed
State for the immediate purpose of the war which led
to its subjugation.<a id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_119_119">[119]</a></p>

(See Huber, op. cit. pp. 156 and
282, note 449.) The Report of the
Transvaal Concessions Commission
(see British State Papers, South
Africa, 1901, Cd. 623), although it
declares (p. 7), that "it is clear that
a State which has annexed another
is not legally bound by any contracts
made by the State which has ceased
to exist," nevertheless agrees that
"the modern usage of nations has
tended in the acknowledgment of
such contracts." It may, however,
safely be maintained that not a
usage, but a real rule of International
Law, based on custom, is in existence
with regard to this point.
(See Hall, § 29, and Westlake in <i>The
Law Quarterly Review</i>, XVII. (1901),
pp. 392-401, XXXI. (1905), p. 335,
and now Westlake, I. pp. 74-82.)</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_116_116"></a><a href="#FNanchor_116_116" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[116]</span></a> This is the real portent of the

(1905), 2 K.B. 391. In so far as the
latter judgment denies the existence
of a rule of International Law that
compels a subjugator to pay the
debts of the subjugated State, its
arguments are in no wise decisive.
An International Court would recognise
such a rule.</p></div>

 the Report of the Transvaal Concession Commission, p.
9, which maintains the contrary. Westlake (I. p. 78) adopts the
reasoning of this report, but his arguments are not decisive. The
lending of money to a belligerent under ordinary mercantile
conditions—see Barclay in <i>The Law Quarterly Review</i>, XXI. (1905), p.
307—is not prohibited by International Law, although the carriage of
such funds in cash on neutral vessels to the enemy falls under the
category of carriage of contraband, and can be punished by the
belligerents. (See
below, Vol. II. § <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41047/41047-h/41047-h.htm#It352" class="pgexternal" id="id-4481341071939553306">352</a>.)</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_119_119"></a><a href="#FNanchor_119_119" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[119]</span></a> The question how far concessions granted by a subjugated
State to a private individual or to a company must be upheld by the
subjugating State, is difficult to answer in its generality. The merits
of each case would seem to have to be taken into consideration. See
Westlake, I. p. 82; Moore, I. § 98; Gidel, "Des effets de l'annexion sur
les concessions" (1904).</p></div>
<p>The case of a Federal State arising—like the German
Empire in 1871—above a number of several hitherto
full Sovereign States also presents, with regard to many
points, a case of State succession.<a id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_120_120">[120]</a> However, no hard-and-fast
rules can be laid down concerning it, since
everything depends upon the question whether the
Federal State is one which—like all those of America—totally
absorbs all international relations of the member-States,
or whether it absorbs—like the German Empire
and Switzerland—these relations to a greater extent
only.<a id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_121_121">[121]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Succession in consequence of Dismemberment.</p></div>
<p>§ 83. When a State breaks up into fragments which
themselves become States and International Persons,
or which are annexed by surrounding States, it becomes
extinct as an International Person, and the same rules
are valid as regards the case of absorption of one State
by another. A difficulty is, however, created when the
territory of the extinct State is absorbed by several
States. Succession actually takes place here too, first,
with regard to the international rights and duties
locally connected with those parts of the territory
which the respective States have absorbed. Succession
takes place, secondly, with regard to the fiscal property
and the fiscal funds which each of the several absorbing
States finds on the part of the territory it absorbs.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
And the debts of the extinct State must be taken over.
But the case is complicated through the fact that there
are several successors to the fiscal property and funds,
and the only rule which can be laid down is that proportionate
parts of the debts must be taken over by
the different successors.</p>
<p>When—as in the case of Sweden-Norway in 1905—a
Real Union<a id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_122_122">[122]</a> is dissolved and the members become
International Persons of their own, a succession likewise
takes place. All treaties concluded by the Union
devolve upon the former members, except those which
were concluded by the Union for one member only—<i>e.g.</i>
by Sweden-Norway for Norway—and which, therefore,
devolve upon such former member only, and,
further, except those which concerned the very Union
and lose all meaning by its dissolution.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_122_122"></a><a href="#FNanchor_122_122" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[122]</span></a> See
 below, § <a href="#A_Real87" class="pginternal">87</a>.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Succession in case of Separation or Cession.</p></div>
<p>§ 84. When in consequence of war or otherwise one
State cedes a part of its territory to another, or when
a part of the territory of a State breaks off and becomes
a State and an International Person of its own,
succession takes place with regard to such international
rights and duties of the predecessor as are locally connected
with the part of the territory ceded or broken
off, and with regard to the fiscal property found on
that part of the territory. It would only be just, if
the successor had to take over a corresponding part of
the debt of its predecessor, but no rule of International
Law concerning this point can be said to exist, although
many treaties have stipulated a devolution of a part
of the debt of the predecessor upon the successor.<a id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_123_123">[123]</a>
Thus, for instance, arts. 9, 33, 42 of the Treaty of Berlin<a id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_124_124">[124]</a>
of 1878 stipulate that Bulgaria, Montenegro, and Servia
should take over a part of the Turkish debt. On the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
other hand, the United States refused, after the cession
of Cuba in 1898, to take over from Spain the so-called
Cuban debt—that is, the debt which was settled by Spain
on Cuba before the war.<a id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_125_125">[125]</a> Spain argued that it
was not intended to transfer to the United States a
proportional part of the debt of Spain, but only such
debt as attached individually to the island of Cuba.
The United States, however, met this argument by the
correct assertion that the debt concerned was not one
incurred by Cuba, but by Spain, and settled by her on
Cuba.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_123_123"></a><a href="#FNanchor_123_123" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[123]</span></a> Many writers, however, maintain that there is such a rule

<div class="sidenote"><p>Real and apparent Composite International Persons.</p></div>
<p>§ 85. International Persons are as a rule single
Sovereign States. In such single States there is one
central political authority as Government which represents
the State, within its borders as well as without
in the international intercourse with other International
Persons. Such single States may be called <i>simple</i>
International Persons. And a State remains a simple<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
International Person, although it may grant so much
internal independence to outlying parts of its territory
that these parts become in a sense States themselves.
Great Britain is a simple International Person, although
the Dominion of Canada, Newfoundland, the Commonwealth
of Australia, New Zealand, and the Union of
South Africa, are now States of their own, because
Great Britain is alone Sovereign and represents exclusively
the British Empire within the Family of
Nations.</p>
<p>Historical events, however, have created, in addition
to the simple International Persons, <i>composite</i> International
Persons. A composite International Person is
in existence when two or more Sovereign States are
linked together in such a way that they take up their
position within the Family of Nations either exclusively
or at least to a great extent as one single International
Person. History has produced two different kinds of
such composite International Persons—namely, Real
Unions and Federal States. In contradistinction to
Real Unions and Federal States, a so-called Personal
Union and the union of so-called Confederated States
are not International Persons.<a id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_126_126">[126]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_126_126"></a><a href="#FNanchor_126_126" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[126]</span></a> I cannot agree with Westlake (I. p. 37) that "the space
which some writers devote to the distinctions between the different
kinds of union between States" is "disproportioned ... to their
international importance." Very important questions are connected with
these distinctions. The question, for instance, whether a diplomatic
envoy sent by Bavaria to this country must be granted the privileges due
to a foreign diplomatic envoy depends upon the question whether Bavaria
is an International Person in spite of her being a member-State of the
German Empire.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>States in Personal Union.</p></div>
<p>§ 86. A Personal Union is in existence when two
Sovereign States and separate International Persons are
linked together through the accidental fact that they
have the same individual as monarch. Thus a Personal
Union existed from 1714 to 1837 between Great Britain
and Hanover, from 1815 to 1890 between the Netherlands
and Luxemburg, and from 1885 to 1908 between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
Belgium and the former Congo Free State. At present
there is no Personal Union in existence. A Personal
Union is not, and is in no point treated as though it
were, an International Person, and its two Sovereign
member-States remain separate International Persons.
Theoretically it is even possible that they make war
against each other, although practically this will never
occur. If, as sometimes happens, they are represented
by one and the same individual as diplomatic envoy,
such individual is the envoy of both States at the same
time, but not the envoy of the Personal Union.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>States in Real Union.</p></div>
<p>§ 87. <a id="A_Real87"></a>A Real Union<a id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_127_127">[127]</a> is in existence when two
Sovereign States are by an international treaty, recognised
by other Powers, linked together for ever under
the same monarch, so that they make one and the
same International Person. A Real Union is not
itself a State, but merely a union of two full Sovereign
States which together make one single but composite
International Person. They form a compound
Power, and are by the treaty of union prevented from
making war against each other. On the other hand,
they cannot make war separately against a foreign
Power, nor can war be made against one of them separately.
They can enter into separate treaties of commerce,
extradition, and the like, but it is always the
Union which concludes such treaties for the separate
States, as they separately are not International Persons.
It is, for instance, Austria-Hungary which concludes an
international treaty of extradition between Hungary
and a foreign Power. The only Real Union at present
in existence outside the German Empire<a id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_128_128">[128]</a> is that of
Austria-Hungary, that of Sweden-Norway having been
dissolved in 1905.</p>

1849, Hungary was united with Austria, but in 1867
Hungary became again a separate Sovereign State and
the Real Union was re-established. Their army, navy,
and foreign ministry are united. The Emperor-King
declares war, makes peace, concludes alliances and
other treaties, and sends and receives the same diplomatic
envoys for both States.</p>
<p>Sweden-Norway became a Real Union<a id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_129_129">[129]</a> in 1814.
The King could declare war, make peace, conclude
alliances and other treaties, and send and receive the
same diplomatic envoys for both States. The Foreign
Secretary of Sweden managed at the same time the
foreign affairs of Norway. Both States had, however,
in spite of the fact that they made one and the same
International Person, different commercial and naval
flags. The Union was peacefully dissolved by the
Treaty of Karlstad of October 26, 1905. Norway
became a separate kingdom, the independence and
integrity of which is guaranteed by Great Britain,
France, Germany, and Russia by the Treaty of Christiania

<div class="sidenote"><p>Confederated States (Staatenbund).</p></div>
<p>§ 88. <a id="Confederated_States88"></a>Confederated States (Staatenbund) are a number
of full Sovereign States linked together for the
maintenance of their external and internal independence
by a recognised international treaty into a union with
organs of its own, which are vested with a certain power
over the member-States, but not over the citizens of
these States. Such a union of Confederated States is
not any more itself a State than a Real Union is; it
is merely an International Confederation of States, a
society of international character, since the member-States
remain full Sovereign States and separate International
Persons. Consequently, the union of Confederated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
States is not an International Person, although
it is for some parts so treated on account of its representing
the compound power of the full Sovereign
member-States. The chief and sometimes the only
organ of the union is a Diet, where the member-States
are represented by diplomatic envoys. The power
vested in the Diet is an International Power which does
not in the least affect the full sovereignty of the member-States.
That power is essentially nothing else than the
right of the body of the members to make war against
such a member as will not submit to those commandments
of the Diet which are in accordance with the
Treaty of Confederation, war between the member-States
being prohibited in all other cases.</p>
<p>History has shown that Confederated States represent
an organisation which in the long run gives very
little satisfaction. It is for that reason that the three
important unions of Confederated States of modern
times—namely, the United States of America, the
German, and the Swiss Confederation—have turned
into unions of Federal States. Notable historic Confederations

1795, the United States of America from 1778 to 1787,
Germany from 1815 to 1866, Switzerland from 1291 to
1798 and from 1815 to 1848, and the Confederation of
the Rhine (Rheinbund) from 1806 to 1813. At present
there is no union of Confederated States. The last in
existence, the major Republic of Central America,<a id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_131_131">[131]</a>
which comprised the three full Sovereign States of
Honduras, Nicaragua, and San Salvador, and was

<p>§ 89. <a id="A_Federal89"></a>A Federal State<a id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_132_132">[132]</a> is a perpetual union of several
Sovereign States which has organs of its own and is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
invested with power, not only over the member-States,
but also over their citizens. The union is based,
first, on an international treaty of the member-States,
and, secondly, on a subsequently accepted constitution
of the Federal State. A Federal State is said to be a
real State side by side with its member-States because
its organs have a direct power over the citizens of those
member-States. This power was established by American<a id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_133_133">[133]</a>
jurists of the eighteenth century as a characteristic
distinction of a Federal State from Confederated
States, and Kent as well as Story, the two later
authorities on the Constitutional Law of the United
States, adopted this distinction, which is indeed kept
up until to-day by the majority of writers on politics.
Now if a Federal State is recognised as a State of its
own, side by side with its member-States, it is evident
that sovereignty must be divided between the Federal
State on the one hand, and, on the other, the member-States.
This division is made in this way, that the competence
over one part of the objects for which a State is
in existence is handed over to the Federal State, whereas
the competence over the other part remains with the
member-States. Within its competence the Federal State
can make laws which bind the citizens of the member-States
directly without any interference of these member-States.
On the other hand, the member-States are
totally independent as far as <i>their</i> competence reaches.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_132_132"></a><a href="#FNanchor_132_132" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[132]</span></a> The distinction between Confederated States and a Federal
State is not at all universally recognised, and the terminology is
consequently not at all the same with all writers on International Law.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_133_133"></a><a href="#FNanchor_133_133" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[133]</span></a> When in 1787 the draft of the new Constitution of the
United States, which had hitherto been Confederated States only, was
under consideration by the Congress at Philadelphia, three members of
the Congress—namely, Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John
Jay—made up their minds to write newspaper articles on the draft
Constitution with the intention of enlightening the nation which had to
vote for the draft. For this purpose they divided the different points
among themselves and treated them separately. All these articles, which
were not signed with the names of their authors, appeared under the
common title "The Federalist." They were later on collected into
book-form and have been edited several times. It is especially Nos. 15
and 16 of "The Federalist" which establish the difference between
Confederated States and a Federal State in the way mentioned in the text
above.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p></div>
<p>For International Law this division of competence
is only of interest in so far as it concerns competence
in <i>international</i> matters. Since it is always the Federal
State which is competent to declare war, make peace,
conclude treaties of alliance and other political treaties,
and send and receive diplomatic envoys, whereas no
member-State can of itself declare war against a foreign
State, make peace, conclude alliances and other political
treaties, the Federal State, if recognised, is certainly an
International Person of its own, with all the rights and
duties of a sovereign member of the Family of Nations.
On the other hand, the international position of the
member-States is not so clear. It is frequently maintained
that they have totally lost their position within
the Family of Nations. But this opinion cannot stand
if compared with the actual facts. Thus, the member-States
of the Federal State of Germany have retained
their competence to send and receive diplomatic envoys,
not only in intercourse with one another, but also with
foreign States. Further, the reigning monarchs of these
member-States are still treated by the practice of the
States as heads of Sovereign States, a fact without legal
basis if these States were no longer International Persons.
Thirdly, the member-States of Germany as well as of
Switzerland have retained their competence to conclude
international treaties between themselves without the
consent of the Federal State, and they have also retained
the competence to conclude international treaties
with foreign States as regards matters of minor interest.
If these facts<a id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_134_134">[134]</a> are taken into consideration, one is
obliged to acknowledge that the member-States of a
Federal State can be International Persons in a degree.
Full subjects of International Law, International Persons
with all the rights and duties regularly connected
with the membership of the Family of Nations, they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
certainly cannot be. Their position, if any, within this
circle is overshadowed by their Federal State, they are
part-Sovereign States, and they are, consequently,
International Persons for some parts only.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_134_134"></a><a href="#FNanchor_134_134" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[134]</span></a> See
 Riess, "Auswärtige Hoheitsrechte der deutschen
Einzelstaaten"(1905).</p></div>
<p>But it happens frequently that a Federal State
assumes <i>in every way</i> the external representation of
its member-States, so that, so far as international relations
are concerned, the member-States do not make
an appearance at all. This is the case with the United
States of America and all those other American Federal
States whose Constitution is formed according to the
model of that of the United States. Here the member-States
are sovereign too, but only with regard to <i>internal</i><a id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_135_135">[135]</a>
affairs. All their external sovereignty being absorbed
by the Federal State, it is certainly a fact that they
are not International Persons at all so long as this
condition of things lasts.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_135_135"></a><a href="#FNanchor_135_135" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[135]</span></a> The Courts of the United States of America have always
upheld the theory that the United States are sovereign as to all powers
of government actually surrendered, whereas each member-State is
sovereign as to all powers reserved. See Merriam, "History of the Theory
of Sovereignty since Rousseau" (1900), p. 163.</p></div>
<p>This being so, two classes of Federal States must be
distinguished<a id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_136_136">[136]</a> according to whether their member-States
are or are not International Persons, although
Federal States are in any case composite International
Persons. And whenever a Federal State comes into
existence which leaves the member-States for some parts
International Persons, the recognition granted to it by
foreign States must include their readiness to recognise
for the future, on the one hand, the body of the member-States,
the Federal State, as one composite International
Person regarding all important matters, and, on the
other hand, the single member-States as International
Persons with regard to less important matters and side
by side with the Federal State. That such a condition<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
of things is abnormal and illogical cannot be denied, but
the very existence of a Federal State side by side the
member-States is quite as abnormal and illogical.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_136_136"></a><a href="#FNanchor_136_136" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[136]</span></a> This distinction is of the greatest
importance and ought to be accepted
by the writers on the science of
politics.</p></div>
<p>The Federal States in existence are the following:—The
United States of America since 1787, Switzerland
since 1848, Germany since 1871, Mexico since 1857,
Argentina since 1860, Brazil since 1891, Venezuela since
1893.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>The Union between Suzerain and Vassal State.</p></div>
<p>§ 90. The union and the relations between a Suzerain
and its Vassal State create much difficulty in the science
of the Law of Nations. As both are separate States, a
union of States they certainly make, but it would be
wrong to say that the Suzerain State is, like the Real
Union of States or the Federal State, a composite
International Person. And it would be equally wrong to
maintain either that a Vassal State cannot be in any way
a separate International Person of its own, or that it is
an International Person of the same kind as any other
State. What makes the matter so complicated, is the
fact that a general rule regarding the relation between
the suzerain and vassal, and, further, regarding the
position, if any, of the vassal within the Family of
Nations, cannot be laid down, as everything depends
upon the special case. What can and must be said is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
that there are some States in existence which, although
they are independent of another State as regards their
internal affairs, are as regards their international affairs
either absolutely or for the most part dependent upon
another State. They are called half-Sovereign<a id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_137_137">[137]</a> States
because they are sovereign within their borders but not
without. The full Sovereign State upon which such
half-Sovereign States are either absolutely or for the
most part internationally dependent, is called the
Suzerain State.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_137_137"></a><a href="#FNanchor_137_137" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[137]</span></a> In contradistinction to the States which are under
suzerainty or protectorate, and which are commonly called
<i>half</i>-Sovereign States, I call member-States of a Federal State
<i>part</i>-Sovereign States.</p></div>
<p>Suzerainty is a term which originally was used for
the relation between the feudal lord and his vassal;
the lord was said to be the suzerain of the vassal, and
at that time suzerainty was a term of Constitutional
Law only. With the disappearance of the feudal
system, suzerainty of this kind likewise disappeared.
Modern suzerainty contains only a few rights of the
Suzerain State over the Vassal State which can be
called constitutional rights. The rights of the Suzerain
State over the Vassal are principally international
rights, of whatever they may consist. Suzerainty is by
no means sovereignty. If it were, the Vassal State
could not be Sovereign in its domestic affairs and could
never have any international relations whatever of its
own. And why should suzerainty be distinguished
from sovereignty if it be a term synonymous with
sovereignty? One may correctly maintain that <i>suzerainty
is a kind of international guardianship</i>, since the
Vassal State is either absolutely or mainly represented
internationally by the Suzerain State.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>International Position of Vassal States.</p></div>
<p>§ 91. <a id="Th91"></a>The fact that the relation between the suzerain
and the vassal always depends upon the special case,
excludes the possibility of laying down a general rule
as regards the position of Vassal States within the Family<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
of Nations. It is certain that a Vassal State as such
need not have any position whatever within the Family
of Nations. In every case in which a Vassal State has
absolutely no relations whatever with other States,
since the suzerain absorbs these relations entirely, such
vassal remains nevertheless a half-Sovereign State on
account of its internal independence, but it has no position
whatever within the Family of Nations, and consequently
is for no part whatever an International Person
and a subject of International Law. This is the position
of the Indian Vassal States of Great Britain, which have
no international relations whatever either between themselves
or with foreign States.<a id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_138_138">[138]</a> Yet instances can be
given which demonstrate that Vassal States can have
some small and subordinate position within that family,
and that they must in consequence thereof in some few
points be considered as International Persons. Thus
Egypt can conclude commercial and postal treaties with
foreign States without the consent of suzerain Turkey,
and Bulgaria could, while she was under Turkish Suzerainty,
conclude treaties regarding railways, post, and
the like. Thus, further, Egypt can send and receive
consuls as diplomatic agents, and so could Bulgaria
while she was a Turkish Vassal State. Thus, thirdly,
the former South African Republic, although in the
opinion of Great Britain under her suzerainty, could
conclude all kinds of treaties with other States, provided
Great Britain did not interpose a <i>veto</i> within six
months after receiving a copy of the draft treaty, and
was absolutely independent in concluding treaties with
the neighbouring Orange Free State. Again, Egypt
possesses, since 1898, together with Great Britain <i>condominium</i><a id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_139_139">[139]</a>
over the Soudan, which means that they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
exercise conjointly sovereignty over this territory.
Although Vassal States have not the right to make war
independently of their suzerain, Bulgaria, at the time a
Vassal State, nevertheless fought a war against the full-Sovereign
Servia in 1885, and Egypt conquered the
Soudan conjointly with Great Britain in 1898.</p>

 below, § <a href="#Th171" class="pginternal">171</a>.</p></div>
<p>How could all these and other facts be explained, if
Vassal States could never for some small part be International
Persons?</p>
<p>Side by side with these facts stand, of course, other
facts which show that for the most part the Vassal
State, even if it has some small position of its own
within the Family of Nations, is considered a mere
portion of the Suzerain State. Thus all international
treaties concluded by the Suzerain State are <i>ipso facto</i>
concluded for the vassal, if an exception is not expressly
mentioned or self-evident. Thus, again, war of the
suzerain is <i>ipso facto</i> war of the vassal. Thus, thirdly,
the suzerain bears within certain limits a responsibility
for actions of the Vassal State.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances it is generally admitted
that the conception of suzerainty lacks juridical precision,
and experience teaches that Vassal States do
not remain half-Sovereign for long. They either shake
off suzerainty, as Roumania, Servia, and Montenegro did
in 1878, and Bulgaria<a id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_140_140">[140]</a> did in 1908, or they lose their
half-Sovereignty through annexation, as in the case of
the South African Republic in 1901, or through merger,
as when the half-Sovereign Seignory of Kniephausen
in Germany merged in 1854 into its suzerain Oldenburg.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Conception of Protectorate.</p></div>
<p>§ 92. <a id="Legally_and_materially92"></a>Legally and materially different from suzerainty
is the relation of protectorate between two States. It
happens that a weak State surrenders itself by treaty
into the protection of a strong and mighty State in
such a way that it transfers the management<a id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_144_144">[144]</a> of all
its more important<a id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_145_145">[145]</a> international affairs to the protecting
State. Through such treaty an international<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
union is called into existence between the two States,
and the relation between them is called protectorate.
The protecting State is internationally the superior of
the protected State, the latter has with the loss of the
management of its more important international affairs
lost its full sovereignty and is henceforth only a half-Sovereign
State. Protectorate is, however, a conception
which, just like suzerainty, lacks exact juristic
precision,<a id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_146_146">[146]</a> as its real meaning depends very much upon
the special case. Generally speaking, protectorate may,
again like suzerainty, be called <i>a kind of international
guardianship</i>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_144_144"></a><a href="#FNanchor_144_144" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[144]</span></a> A treaty of protectorate must not be confounded with a
treaty of protection in which one or more strong States promise to
protect a weak State without absorbing the international relations of
the latter.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_145_145"></a><a href="#FNanchor_145_145" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[145]</span></a> That the admittance of Consuls belongs to these affairs
became apparent in 1906, when Russia, after some hesitation, finally
agreed upon Japan, and not Korea, granting the <i>exequatur</i> to the
Consul-general appointed by Russia for Korea, which was then a State
under Japanese protectorate. See
 below, § <a href="#Consuls_are_appointed427" class="pginternal">427</a>.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_146_146"></a><a href="#FNanchor_146_146" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[146]</span></a> It is therefore of great importance that the parties should
make quite clear the meaning of a clause which is supposed to stipulate
a protectorate. Thus art. 17 of the Treaty of Friendship and Commerce
between Italy and Abyssinia, signed at Uccialli on May 2, 1889—see
Martens, N.R.G. 2nd Ser. XVIII. p. 697—was interpreted by Italy as
establishing a protectorate over Abyssinia, but the latter refused to
recognise it.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>International position of States under Protectorate.</p></div>
<p>§ 93. <a id="The_position_of_a_State93"></a>The position of a State under protectorate
within the Family of Nations cannot be defined by a
general rule, since it is the treaty of protectorate which
indirectly specialises it by enumerating the reciprocal
rights and duties of the protecting and the protected
State. Each case must therefore be treated according
to its own merits. Thus the question whether the
protected State can conclude certain international
treaties and can send and receive diplomatic envoys,
as well as other questions, must be decided according to
the terms of the individual treaty of protectorate. In
any case, recognition of the protectorate on the part of
third States is necessary to enable the superior State
to represent the protected State internationally. But
it is characteristic of the protectorate, in contradistinction
to suzerainty, that the protected State always
has and retains for some parts a position of its own
within the Family of Nations, and that it is always for
some parts an International Person and a subject of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
International Law. It is never in any respect considered
a mere portion of the superior State. It is,
therefore, not necessarily a party in a war<a id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_147_147">[147]</a> of the
superior State against a third, and treaties concluded
by the superior State are not <i>ipso facto</i> concluded for
the protected State. And, lastly, it can at the same
time be under the protectorate of two different States,
which, of course, must exercise the protectorate conjointly.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_147_147"></a><a href="#FNanchor_147_147" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[147]</span></a> This was recognised by the English Prize Courts during the
Crimean War with regard to the Ionian Islands, which were then still
under British protectorate; see the case of the Ionian Ships, 2 Spinks

<p>In Europe there are at present only two very small
States under protectorate—namely, the republic of
Andorra, under the joint protectorate of France and
Spain,<a id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_148_148">[148]</a> and the republic of San Marino, an enclosure of
Italy, which was formerly under the protectorate of the
Papal States and is now under that of Italy. The
Principality of Monaco, which was under the protectorate,
first of Spain until 1693, afterwards of France
until 1815, and then of Sardinia, has now, through
custom, become a full-Sovereign State, since Italy has
never<a id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_149_149">[149]</a> exercised the protectorate. The Ionian Islands,
which were under British protectorate from 1815,
merged into the Kingdom of Greece in 1863.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_148_148"></a><a href="#FNanchor_148_148" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[148]</span></a> This protectorate is exercised for Spain by the Bishop of
Urgel. As regards the international position of Andorra, see Vilar,

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_149_149"></a><a href="#FNanchor_149_149" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[149]</span></a> This is a clear case of <i>desuetudo</i>.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Protectorates outside the Family of Nations.</p></div>
<p>§ 94. <a id="Outside_Europe_there_are94"></a>Outside Europe there are numerous States
under the protectorate of European States, but all of
them are non-Christian States of such a civilisation as
would not admit them to full membership of the Family
of Nations, apart from the protectorate under which they
are now. And it may therefore be questioned whether
they have any real position within the Family of Nations
at all. As the protectorate over them is recognised by
third States, the latter are legally prevented from exercising<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
any political influence in these protected States,
and, failing special treaty rights, they have no right to
interfere if the protecting State annexes the protected
State and makes it a mere colony of its own, as, for
instance, France did with Madagascar in 1896. Protectorates
of this kind are actually nothing else than
the first step to annexation.<a id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_150_150">[150]</a> Since they are based on
treaties with real States, they cannot in every way be
compared with the so-called protectorates over African
tribes which European States acquire through a treaty
with the chiefs of these tribes, and by which the respective
territory is preserved for future occupation on the
part of the so-called protector.<a id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_151_151">[151]</a> But actually they
always lead to annexation, if the protected State does
not succeed in shaking off by force the protectorate, as
Abyssinia did in 1896 when she shook off the pretended
Italian protectorate.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Conception of Neutralised States.</p></div>
<p>§ 95. <a id="A_neutralised_State95"></a>A neutralised State is a State whose independence
and integrity are for all the future guaranteed
by an international convention of the Powers, under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
the condition that such State binds itself never to take
up arms against any other State except for defence
against attack, and never to enter into such international
obligations as could indirectly drag it into war. The
reason why a State asks or consents to become neutralised
is that it is a weak State and does not want an
active part in international politics, being exclusively
devoted to peaceable developments of welfare. The
reason why the Powers neutralise a weak State may be
a different one in different cases. The chief reasons
have been hitherto the balance of power in Europe and
the interest in keeping up a weak State as a so-called
Buffer-State between the territories of Great Powers.</p>
<p>Not to be confounded with neutralisation of States
is neutralisation of parts of States,<a id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_152_152">[152]</a> of rivers, canals,
and the like, which has the effect that war cannot there
be made and prepared.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_152_152"></a><a href="#FNanchor_152_152" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[152]</span></a> See

<div class="sidenote"><p>Act and Condition of Neutralisation.</p></div>
<p>§ 96. <a id="Without_thereby96"></a>Without thereby becoming a neutralised State,
every State can conclude a treaty with another State
and undertake the obligation to remain neutral if such
other State enters upon war. The act through which
a State becomes a neutralised State for all the future
is always an international treaty of the Powers between
themselves and between the State concerned, by which
treaty the Powers guarantee collectively the independence
and integrity of the latter State. If all the Great
Powers do not take part in the treaty, those which do
not take part in it must at least give their tacit consent
by taking up an attitude which shows that they agree
to the neutralisation, although they do not guarantee
it. In guaranteeing the permanent neutrality of a
State the contracting Powers enter into the obligation
not to violate on their part the independence of the
neutral State and to prevent other States from such
violation. But the neutral State becomes, apart from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
the guaranty, in no way dependent upon the guarantors,
and the latter gain no influence whatever over the
neutral State in matters which have nothing to do with
the guaranty.</p>
<p>The condition of the neutralisation is that the
neutralised State abstains from any hostile action, and
further from any international engagement which could
indirectly<a id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_153_153">[153]</a> drag it into hostilities against any other
State. And it follows from the neutralisation that the
neutralised State can, apart from frontier regulations,
neither cede a part of its territory nor acquire new parts
of territory without the consent of the Powers.<a id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_154_154">[154]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_153_153"></a><a href="#FNanchor_153_153" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[153]</span></a> It was, therefore, impossible for Belgium, which was a
party to the treaty that neutralised Luxemburg in 1867, to take part in
the guarantee of this neutralisation. See article 2 of the Treaty of
London of May 11, 1867: "sous la sanction de la garantie collective des
puissances signataires, à l'exception de la Belgique, qui est elle-même
un état neutre."</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_154_154"></a><a href="#FNanchor_154_154" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[154]</span></a> This is a much discussed and very controverted point. See
 Descamps, "La Neutralité de la Belgique" (1902), pp. 508-527; Fauchille
in R.G. II. (1895), pp. 400-439; Westlake in R.I. 2nd Ser. III. (1901),

<div class="sidenote"><p>International position of Neutralised States.</p></div>
<p>§ 97. <a id="Since_a_neutralised97"></a>Since a neutralised State is under the obligation
not to make war against any other State, except
when attacked, and not to conclude treaties of alliance,
guaranty, and the like, it is frequently maintained that
neutralised States are part-Sovereign only and not
International Persons of the same position within the
Family of Nations as other States. This opinion has,
however, no basis if the real facts and conditions of the
neutralisation are taken into consideration. If sovereignty
is nothing else than supreme authority, a neutralised
State is as fully Sovereign as any not neutralised
State. It is entirely independent outside as well as
inside its borders, since independence does not at all
mean boundless liberty of action.<a id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_155_155">[155]</a> Nobody maintains
that the guaranteed protection of the independence and
integrity of the neutralised State places this State under
the protectorate or any other kind of authority of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
guarantors. And the condition of the neutralisation
to abstain from war, treaties of alliance, and the like,
contains restrictions which do in no way destroy the
full sovereignty of the neutralised State. Such condition
has the consequence only that the neutralised
State exposes itself to an intervention by right, and
loses the guaranteed protection in case it commits hostilities
against another State, enters into a treaty of
alliance, and the like. Just as a not-neutralised State
which has concluded treaties of arbitration with other
States to settle all conflicts between one another by
arbitration has not lost part of its sovereignty because
it has thereby to abstain from arms, so a neutralised
State has not lost part of its sovereignty through entering
into the obligation to abstain from hostilities and
treaties of alliance. This becomes quite apparent when
it is taken into consideration that a neutralised State
not only can conclude treaties of all kinds, except
treaties of alliance, guarantee, and the like, but can
also have an army and navy<a id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_156_156">[156]</a> and can build fortresses,
as long as this is done with the purpose of preparing
defence only. Neutralisation does not even exercise an
influence upon the rank of a State. Belgium, Switzerland,
and Luxemburg are States with royal honours and
do not rank behind Great Britain or any other of the
guarantors of their neutralisation. Nor is it denied
that neutralised States, in spite of their weakness and
comparative unimportance, can nevertheless play an
important part within the Family of Nations. Although
she has no voice where history is made by the
sword, Switzerland has exercised great influence with
regard to several points of progress in International
Law. Thus the Geneva Convention owes its existence
to the initiative of Switzerland. The fact that a permanently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
neutralised State is in many questions a
disinterested party makes such State fit to take the
initiative where action by a Great Power would create
suspicion and reservedness on the part of other Powers.</p>

condition not to keep an armed force with the exception of a police, is
an anomaly.</p></div>
<p>But neutralised States are and must always be an
exception. The Family and the Law of Nations could
not be what they are if ever the number of neutralised
States should be much increased. It is neither in the
interest of the Law of Nations, nor in that of humanity,
that all the small States should become neutralised, as
thereby the political influence of the few Great Powers
would become still greater than it already is. The
neutralised States still in existence—namely, Switzerland,
Belgium, and Luxemburg—are a product of the
nineteenth century only, and it remains to be seen
whether neutralisation can stand the test of history.<a id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_157_157">[157]</a></p>

independent State under the joint protection of Austria, Prussia, and
Russia by the Vienna Congress in 1815, and permanently neutralised, but
which was annexed by Austria in 1846 (see Nys, I. pp. 383-385), cannot
be quoted as an example that neutralised States have no durability. This
annexation was only the last act in the drama of the absorption of
Poland by her neighbours. As regards the former Congo Free State, see

<div class="sidenote"><p>Switzerland.</p></div>
<p>§ 98. The Swiss Confederation,<a id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_158_158">[158]</a> which was recognised
by the Westphalian Peace of 1648, has pursued a
traditional policy of neutrality since that time. During
the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars, however,
she did not succeed in keeping up her neutrality.
French intervention brought about in 1803 a new Constitution,
according to which the single cantons ceased
to be independent States and Switzerland turned from
a Confederation of States into the simple State of the
Helvetic Republic, which was, moreover, through a
treaty of alliance linked to France. It was not till 1813
that Switzerland became again a Confederation of
States, and not till 1815 that she succeeded in becoming
permanently neutralised. On March 20, 1815, at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
Congress at Vienna, Great Britain, Austria, France,
Portugal, Prussia, Spain, and Russia signed the declaration
in which the permanent neutrality of Switzerland
was recognised and collectively guaranteed, and on
May 27, 1815, Switzerland acceded to this declaration.
Article 84 of the Act of the Vienna Congress confirmed
this declaration, and an Act, dated November 20, 1815,
of the Powers assembled at Paris after the final defeat
of Napoleon recognised it again.<a id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_159_159">[159]</a> Since that time
Switzerland has always succeeded in keeping up her
neutrality. She has built fortresses and organised a
strong army for that purpose, and in January 1871,
during the Franco-German War, she disarmed a French
army of more than 80,000 men who had taken refuge
on her territory, and guarded them till after the war.</p>

she was recognised as an independent State in
1831. The Treaty of London, signed on November 15,
1831, by Great Britain, Austria, Belgium, France,
Prussia, and Russia, stipulates in its article 7 at the

of Belgium, and in its article 25 the guaranty of
the signatory five Great Powers.<a id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_161_161">[161]</a> And the guaranty

the same time a member of the Germanic Confederation,
and Prussia had since 1856 the right to keep troops
in the fortress of Luxemburg. In 1866 the Germanic
Confederation came to an end, and Napoleon III. made
efforts to acquire Luxemburg by purchase from the
King of Holland, who was at the same time Grand Duke
of Luxemburg. As Prussia objected to this, it seemed
advisable to the Powers to neutralise Luxemburg. A
Conference met in London, at which Great Britain,
Austria, Belgium, France, Holland and Luxemburg,
Italy, Prussia, and Russia were represented, and on
May 11, 1867, a treaty was signed for the purpose of the
neutralisation, which is stipulated and collectively guaranteed
by all the signatory Powers, Belgium as a neutralised
State herself excepted, by article 2.<a id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_164_164">[164]</a></p>

<p>The neutralisation took place, however, under the
abnormal condition that Luxemburg is not allowed to
keep any armed force, with the exception of a police

any fortresses. Under these circumstances Luxemburg
herself can do nothing for the defence of her neutrality,

Conference<a id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_166_166">[166]</a> of 1884-1885, was a permanently neutralised
State from 1885-1908, but its neutralisation was
imperfect in so far as it was not guaranteed by the
Powers. This fact is explained by the circumstances
under which the Congo Free State attained its neutralisation.
Article 10 of the General Act of the Congo
Conference of Berlin stipulates that the signatory Powers
shall respect the neutrality of any territory within the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
Congo district, provided the Power then or hereafter in
possession of the territory proclaims its neutrality.
Accordingly, when the Congo Free State was recognised
by the Congress of Berlin, the King of the Belgians, as
the sovereign of the Congo State, declared<a id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_167_167">[167]</a> it permanently
neutral, and this declaration was notified to
and recognised by the Powers. Since the Congo Conference
did not guarantee the neutrality of the territories
within the Congo district, the neutralisation of
the Congo Free State was not guaranteed either. In
1908<a id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_168_168">[168]</a> the Congo Free State merged by cession into
Belgium.</p>

of the dominion<a id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_169_169">[169]</a> of the Law of Nations that
this dominion extends beyond the Christian and includes
now the Mahometan State of Turkey and the
Buddhistic State of Japan. As all full-Sovereign International
Persons are equal to one another, no essential
difference exists within the Family of Nations between
Christian and non-Christian States. That foreigners
residing in Turkey are still under the exclusive jurisdiction
of their consuls, is an anomaly based on a restriction
on territorial supremacy arising partly from
custom and partly from treaties. If Turkey could ever
succeed, as Japan did, in introducing such reforms as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
would create confidence in the impartiality of her Courts
of Justice, this restriction would certainly be abolished.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>International position of non-Christian States except Turkey
and Japan.</p></div>
<p>§ 103. <a id="Doubtful_is_the103"></a>Doubtful is the position of all non-Christian
States except Turkey and Japan, such as China, Morocco,
Siam, Persia, and further Abyssinia, although the
latter is a Christian State, and although China, Persia,
and Siam took part in the Hague Peace Conferences
of 1899 and 1907. Their civilisation is essentially so
different from that of the Christian States that international
intercourse with them of the same kind as
between Christian States has been hitherto impossible.
And neither their governments nor their populations are
at present able to fully understand the Law of Nations
and to take up an attitude which is in conformity with
all the rules of this law. There should be no doubt that
these States are not International Persons of the same
kind and the same position within the Family of Nations
as Christian States. But it is equally wrong to maintain
that they are absolutely outside the Family of
Nations, and are for no part International Persons.
Since they send and receive diplomatic envoys and conclude
international treaties, the opinion is justified that
such States are International Persons only in some
respects—namely, those in which they have expressly
or tacitly been received into the Family of Nations.
When Christian States begin such intercourse with these
non-Christian States as to send diplomatic envoys to
them and receive their diplomatic envoys, and when
they enter into treaty obligations with them, they indirectly
declare that they are ready to recognise them
for these parts as International Persons and subjects of
the Law of Nations. But for other parts such non-Christian
States remain as yet outside the circle of the
Family of Nations, especially with regard to war, and
they are for those parts treated by the Christian Powers
according to discretion. This condition of things will,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
however, not last very long. It may be expected that
with the progress of civilisation these States will become
sooner or later International Persons in the full sense
of the term. They are at present in a state of transition,
and some of them are the subjects of international
arrangements of great political importance. Thus by
the Treaty of London of December 13, 1906, Great
Britain, France, and Italy agree to co-operate in maintaining
the independence and integrity of Abyssinia,<a id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_170_170">[170]</a>

Austria-Hungary, Belgium, Spain, the United States

anarchy in Morocco and to introduce reforms in its

<div class="sidenote"><p>The former Papal States.</p></div>
<p>§ 104. When the Law of Nations began to grow up
among the States of Christendom, the Pope was the
monarch of one of those States—namely, the so-called
Papal States. This State owed its existence to Pepin-le-Bref
and his son Charlemagne, who established it in
gratitude to the Popes Stephen III. and Adrian I., who
crowned them as Kings of the Franks. It remained
in the hands of the Popes till 1798, when it became a
republic for about three years. In 1801 the former
order of things was re-established, but in 1809 it became
a part of the Napoleonic Empire. In 1814 it was
re-established, and remained in existence till 1870, when
it was annexed to the Kingdom of Italy. Throughout
the existence of the Papal States, the Popes were
monarchs and, as such, equals of all other monarchs.
Their position was, however, even then anomalous, as
their influence and the privileges granted to them by
the different States were due, not alone to their being
monarchs of a State, but to their being the head of
the Roman Catholic Church. But this anomaly did not
create any real difficulty, since the privileges granted to
the Popes existed within the province of precedence
only.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>The Italian Law of Guaranty.</p></div>
<p>§ 105. When, in 1870, Italy annexed the Papal
States and made Rome her capital, she had to undertake
the task of creating a position for the Holy See
and the Pope which was consonant with the importance
of the latter to the Roman Catholic Church. It seemed
impossible that the Pope should become an ordinary
Italian subject and that the Holy See should be an
institution under the territorial supremacy of Italy.
For many reasons no alteration was desirable in the
administration by the Holy See of the affairs of the
Roman Catholic Church or in the position of the Pope
as the inviolable head of that Church. To meet the case
the Italian Parliament passed an Act regarding the
guaranties granted to the Pope and the Holy See, which
is commonly called the "Law of Guaranty." According
to this the position of the Pope and the Holy See is
in Italy as follows:—</p>
<p>The person of the Pope is sacred and inviolable
(article 1), although he is subjected to the Civil Courts
of Italy.<a id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_173_173">[173]</a> An offence against his person is to be punished
in the same way as an offence against the King
of Italy (article 2). He enjoys all the honours of a
sovereign, retains the privileges of precedence conceded
to him by Roman Catholic monarchs, has the right to
keep an armed body-guard of the same strength as
before the annexation for the safety of his person and
of his palaces (article 3), and receives an allowance of
3,225,000 francs (article 4). The Vatican, the seat of
the Holy See, and the palaces where a conclave for the
election of a new Pope or where an Oecumenical Council
meets, are inviolable, and no Italian official is allowed
to enter them without consent of the Holy See (articles
5-8). The Pope is absolutely free in performing all the
functions connected with his mission as head of the
Roman Catholic Church, and so are his officials (articles<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
9 and 10). The Pope has the right to send and to
receive envoys, who enjoy all the privileges of the
diplomatic envoys sent and received by Italy (article
11). The freedom of communication between the Pope
and the entire Roman Catholic world is recognised, and
the Pope has therefore the right to a post and telegraph
office of his own in the Vatican or any other place of
residence and to appoint his own post-office clerks
(article 12). And, lastly, the colleges and other institutions
of the Pope for the education of priests in Rome
and the environments remain under his exclusive supervision,
without any interference on the part of the
Italian authorities.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_173_173"></a><a href="#FNanchor_173_173" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[173]</span></a> See
 Bonfils, No. 379.</p></div>
<p>No Pope has as yet recognised this Italian Law of
Guaranty, nor had foreign States an opportunity of
giving their express consent to the position of the Pope
in Italy created by that law. But practically foreign
States as well as the Popes themselves, although the
latter have never ceased to protest against the condition
of things created by the annexation of the Papal States,
have made use of the provisions<a id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_174_174">[174]</a> of that law. Several
foreign States send side by side with their diplomatic
envoys accredited to Italy special envoys to the Pope,
and the latter sends envoys to several foreign States.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_174_174"></a><a href="#FNanchor_174_174" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[174]</span></a> But the Popes have hitherto never accepted the allowance
provided by the Law of Guaranty.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>International position of the Holy See and the Pope.</p></div>
<p>§ 106. <a id="The_Law_of_Guaranty106"></a>The Law of Guaranty is not International
but Italian Municipal Law, and the members of the
Family of Nations have hitherto not made any special
arrangements with regard to the International position
of the Holy See and the Pope. And, further, there can
be no doubt that since the extinction of the Papal States
the Pope is no longer a monarch whose sovereignty is
derived from his position as the head of a State. For
these reasons many writers<a id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_175_175">[175]</a> maintain that the Holy
See and the Pope have no longer any international<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
position whatever according to the Law of Nations,
since States only and exclusively are International
Persons. But if the facts of international life and the
actual condition of things in every-day practice are
taken into consideration, this opinion has no basis to
stand upon. Although the Holy See is not a State, the
envoys sent by her to foreign States are treated by the
latter on the same footing with diplomatic envoys as
regards exterritoriality, inviolability, and ceremonial
privileges, and those foreign States which send envoys
to the Holy See claim for them from Italy all the privileges
and the position of diplomatic envoys. Further,
although the Pope is no longer the head of a State, the
privileges due to the head of a monarchical State are
still granted to him by foreign States. Of course,
through this treatment the Holy See does not acquire
the character of an International Person, nor does the
Pope thereby acquire the character of a head of a
monarchical State. But for some points the Holy See
is actually treated as though she were an International
Person, and the Pope is treated actually in every point
as though he were the head of a monarchical State. It
must therefore be maintained that by custom, by tacit
consent of the members of the Family of Nations, the
Holy See has a <i>quasi</i> international position. This position
allows her to claim against all the States treatment
on some points as though she were an International
Person, and further to claim treatment of the Pope in
every point as though he were the head of a monarchical
State. But it must be emphasised that, although the
envoys sent and received by the Holy See must be
treated as diplomatic envoys,<a id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_176_176">[176]</a> they are not such in fact,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
for they are not agents for international affairs of
States, but exclusively agents for the affairs of the
Roman Catholic Church. And it must further be emphasised
that the Holy See cannot conclude international
treaties or claim a vote at international congresses
and conferences. The so-called Concordats—that
is, treaties between the Holy See and States with
regard to matters of the Roman Catholic Church—are
not international treaties, although analogous treatment
is usually given to them. Even formerly, when the Pope
was the head of a State, such Concordats were not concluded
with the Papal States, but with the Holy See and
the Pope as representatives of the Roman Catholic
Church.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_176_176"></a><a href="#FNanchor_176_176" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[176]</span></a> The case of Montagnini, which occurred in December 1906,
cannot be quoted against this assertion, for Montagnini was not at the
time a person enjoying diplomatic privileges. Diplomatic relations
between France and the Holy See had come to an end in 1905 by France
recalling her envoy at the Vatican and at the same time sending the
passports to Lorenzelli, the Papal Nuncio in Paris. Montagnini, who
remained at the nunciature in Paris, did not possess any diplomatic
character after the departure of the Nuncio. Neither his arrest and his
expulsion in December 1906, nor the seizure of his papers at the
nunciature amounted therefore to an international delinquency on the
part of the French Government. The papers left by the former Papal
Nuncio Lorenzelli were not touched and remained in the archives of the
former nunciature until the Austrian ambassador in Paris, in February
1907, asked the French Foreign Office to transfer them to him for the
purpose of handing them on to the Holy See. It must be specially
mentioned that the seizure of his papers and the arrest and expulsion of
Montagnini took place because he conspired against the French Government
by encouraging the clergy to refuse obedience to French laws. And it
must further be mentioned that Lorenzelli, when he left the nunciature,
did not, contrary to all precedent, place the archives of the nunciature
under seals and confide them to the protection of another diplomatic
envoy in Paris. Details of the case are to be found in R.I. 2nd Ser. IX.
(1907), pp. 60-66, and R.G. XIV. (1907), pp. 175-186.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Violation of the Holy See and the Pope.</p></div>
<p>§ 107. Since the Holy See has no power whatever
to protect herself and the person of the Pope against
violations, the question as to the protection of the Holy
See and the person of the Pope arises. I believe that,
since the present international position of the Holy See
rests on the tacit consent of the members of the Family
of Nations, many a Roman Catholic Power would raise
its voice in case Italy or any other State should violate
the Holy See or the person of the Pope, and an intervention
for the purpose of protecting either of them
would have the character of an intervention by right.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
Italy herself would certainly make such a violation by
a foreign Power her own affair, although she has no
more than any other Power the legal duty to do so,
and although she is not responsible to other Powers
for violations of the Personality of the latter by the
Holy See and the Pope.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>The so-called Fundamental Rights.</p></div>
<p>§ 112. Until the last two decades of the nineteenth
century all jurists agreed that the membership of the
Family of Nations includes so-called fundamental rights
for States. Such rights are chiefly enumerated as the
right of existence, of self-preservation, of equality, of
independence, of territorial supremacy, of holding and
acquiring territory, of intercourse, and of good name
and reputation. It was and is maintained that these
fundamental rights are a matter of course and self-evident,
since the Family of Nations consists of Sovereign
States. But no unanimity exists with regard to
the number, the names, and the contents of these
alleged fundamental rights. A great confusion exists
in this matter, and hardly two text-book writers agree
in details with regard to it. This condition of things
has led to a searching criticism of the whole matter,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
and several writers<a id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_177_177">[177]</a> have in consequence thereof asked
that the fundamental rights of States should totally
disappear from the treatises on the Law of Nations. I
certainly agree with this. Yet it must be taken into
consideration that under the wrong heading of fundamental
rights a good many correct statements have
been made for hundreds of years, and that numerous
real rights and duties are customarily recognised which
are derived from the very membership of the Family
of Nations. They are rights and duties which do not
rise from international treaties between a multitude of
States, but which the States customarily hold as International
Persons, and which they grant and receive
reciprocally as members of the Family of Nations.
They are rights and duties connected with the position
of the States within the Family of Nations, and it is
therefore only adequate to their importance to discuss
them in a special chapter under that heading.</p>

considerable resistance, and the existence of fundamental rights of
States is emphatically defended by other writers. See, for instance,

<div class="sidenote"><p>International Personality a Body of Qualities.</p></div>
<p>§ 113. <a id="International_Personality113"></a>International Personality is the term which
characterises fitly the position of the States within the
Family of Nations, since a State acquires International
Personality through its recognition as a member. What
it really means can be ascertained by going back to the
basis<a id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_178_178">[178]</a> of the Law of Nations. Such basis is the common
consent of the States that a body of legal rules
shall regulate their intercourse with one another. Now
a legally regulated intercourse between Sovereign States
is only possible under the condition that a certain
liberty of action is granted to every State, and that,
on the other hand, every State consents to a certain restriction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
of action in the interest of the liberty of action
granted to every other State. A State that enters into
the Family of Nations retains the natural liberty of
action due to it in consequence of its sovereignty, but
at the same time takes over the obligation to exercise
self-restraint and to restrict its liberty of action in the
interest of that of other States. In entering into the
Family of Nations a State comes as an equal to equals<a id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_179_179">[179]</a>;
it demands that certain consideration be paid to its
dignity, the retention of its independence, of its territorial
and its personal supremacy. Recognition of a
State as a member of the Family of Nations contains
recognition of such State's equality, dignity, independence,
and territorial and personal supremacy. But
the recognised State recognises in turn the same qualities
in other members of that family, and thereby it undertakes
responsibility for violations committed by it.
All these qualities constitute as a body the International
Personality of a State, and International Personality
may therefore be said to be the fact, given by the very
membership of the Family of Nations, that equality,
dignity, independence, territorial and personal supremacy,
and the responsibility of every State are recognised
by every other State. The States are International
Persons because they recognise these qualities in one
another and recognise their responsibility for violations
of these qualities.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_178_178"></a><a href="#FNanchor_178_178" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[178]</span></a> See
 above, § <a href="#Wh12" class="pginternal">12</a>.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_179_179"></a><a href="#FNanchor_179_179" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[179]</span></a> See

<div class="sidenote"><p>Other Characteristics of the position of the States within
the Family of Nations.</p></div>
<p>§ 114. But the position of the States within the
Family of Nations is not exclusively characterised by
these qualities. The States make a community because
there is constant intercourse between them. Intercourse
is therefore a condition without which the Family
of Nations would not and could not exist. Again, there
are exceptions to the protection of the qualities which
constitute the International Personality of the States,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
and these exceptions are likewise characteristic of the
position of the States within the Family of Nations.
Thus, in time of war belligerents have a right to violate
one another's Personality in many ways; even annihilation
of the vanquished State, through subjugation
after conquest, is allowed. Thus, further, in time of
peace as well as in time of war, such violations of the
Personality of other States are excused as are committed
in self-preservation or through justified intervention.
And, finally, jurisdiction is also important
for the position of the States within the Family of
Nations. Intercourse, self-preservation, intervention,
and jurisdiction must, therefore, likewise be discussed
in this chapter.</p>

</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Legal Equality of States.</p></div>
<p>§ 115. <a id="The_equality_before115"></a>The equality before International Law of all
member-States of the Family of Nations is an invariable
quality derived from their International Personality.<a id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_180_180">[180]</a>
Whatever inequality may exist between States as
regards their size, population, power, degree of civilisation,
wealth, and other qualities, they are nevertheless
equals as International Persons. This legal equality
has three important consequences:</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_180_180"></a><a href="#FNanchor_180_180" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[180]</span></a> See
 above, §§ <a href="#Since_the_Law14" class="pginternal">14</a>
and <a href="#International_Personality113" class="pginternal">113</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p></div>
<p>The first is that, whenever a question arises which
has to be settled by the consent of the members of the
Family of Nations, every State has a right to a vote,
but to one vote only.</p>
<p>The second consequence is that legally—although
not politically—the vote of the weakest and smallest
State has quite as much weight as the vote of the largest
and most powerful. Therefore any alteration of an
existing rule or creation of a new rule of International
Law by a law-making treaty has legal validity for the
signatory Powers and those only who later on accede
expressly or submit to it tacitly through custom.</p>
<p>The third consequence is that—according to the rule
<i>par in parem non habet imperium</i>—no State can claim
jurisdiction over another full-Sovereign State. Therefore,
although foreign States can sue in foreign Courts,<a id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_181_181">[181]</a>
they cannot as a rule be sued<a id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_182_182">[182]</a> there, unless they voluntarily
accept<a id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_183_183">[183]</a> the jurisdiction of the Court concerned,

<p>To the rule of equality there are three exceptions:—</p>
<p>First, such States as can for some parts<a id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_185_185">[185]</a> only be
considered International Persons, are not equals of the
full members of the Family of Nations.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_185_185"></a><a href="#FNanchor_185_185" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[185]</span></a> See
 above, § <a href="#Doubtful_is_the103" class="pginternal">103</a>.</p></div>
<p>Secondly, States under suzerainty and under protectorate
which are half-Sovereign and under the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
guardianship<a id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_186_186">[186]</a> of other States with regard to the management
of external affairs, are not equals of States
which enjoy full sovereignty.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_186_186"></a><a href="#FNanchor_186_186" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[186]</span></a> See
 above, §§ <a href="#Th91" class="pginternal">91</a> and <a href="#The_position_of_a_State93" class="pginternal">93</a>.</p></div>
<p>Thirdly, the part-sovereign member-States of a
Federal State are not equals of full-Sovereign States.</p>
<p>It is, however, quite impossible to lay down a
hard and fast general rule concerning the amount of
inequality between the equal and the unequal States,
as everything depends upon the circumstances and
conditions of the special case.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Political Hegemony of Great Powers.</p></div>
<p>§ 116. Legal equality must not be confounded with
political equality. The enormous differences between
States as regards their strength are the result of a natural
inequality which, apart from rank and titles, finds its
expression in the province of policy. Politically, States
are in no manner equals, as there is a difference between
the Great Powers and others. Eight States must at
present be considered as Great Powers—namely, Great
Britain, Austria-Hungary, France, Germany, Italy, and
Russia in Europe, the United States in America, and
Japan in Asia. All arrangements made by the body
of the Great Powers naturally gain the consent of the
minor States, and the body of the six Great Powers in
Europe is therefore called the European Concert. The
Great Powers are the leaders of the Family of Nations,
and every progress of the Law of Nations during the
past is the result of their political hegemony, although
the initiative towards the progress was frequently
taken by a minor Power.</p>
<p>But, however important the position and the influence
of the Great Powers may be, they are by no means
derived from a legal basis or rule.<a id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_187_187">[187]</a> It is nothing else
than powerful example which makes the smaller States<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
agree to the arrangements of the Great Powers. Nor has
a State the character of a Great Power by law. It is
nothing else than its actual size and strength which
makes a State a Great Power. Changes, therefore,
often take place. Whereas at the time of the Vienna
Congress in 1815 eight States—namely, Great Britain,
Austria, France, Portugal, Prussia, Spain, Sweden, and
Russia—were still considered Great Powers, their number
decreased soon to five, when Portugal, Spain, and Sweden
lost that character. But the so-called Pentarchy of
the remaining Great Powers turned into a Hexarchy
after the unification of Italy, because the latter became
at once a Great Power. The United States rose as a
Great Power out of the civil war in 1865, and Japan
did the same out of the war with China in 1895. Any
day a change may take place and one of the present
Great Powers may lose its position, or one of the weaker
States may become a Great Power. It is a question
of political influence, and not of law, whether a State
is or is not a Great Power. Whatever large-sized State
with a large population gains such strength that
its political influence must be reckoned with by the
other Great Powers, becomes a Great Power itself.<a id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_188_188">[188]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_187_187"></a><a href="#FNanchor_187_187" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[187]</span></a> This is, however, maintained by a few writers. See,
 for
instance, Lorimer, I. p. 170; Lawrence, §§ 113 and 114; Westlake, I. pp.
308, 309; and Pitt Cobbett, "Cases and Opinions on International Law,"
2nd ed. vol. I. (1909), p. 50.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_188_188"></a><a href="#FNanchor_188_188" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[188]</span></a> In contradistinction to the generally recognised political
hegemony of the Great Powers, Lawrence (§§ 113 and 114) and Taylor (§
69) maintain that the position of the Great Powers is <i>legally</i> superior
to that of the smaller States, being a "Primacy" or "Overlordship." This
doctrine, which professedly seeks to abolish the universally recognised
rule of the equality of States, has no sound basis, and confounds
political with legal inequality. I cannot agree with Lawrence when he
says (§ 114, p. 276):—"... in a system of rules depending, like
International Law, for their validity on general consent, what is
political is legal also, if it is generally accepted and acted on." The
Great Powers are <i>de facto</i>, by the smaller States, recognised as
political leaders, but this recognition does not involve recognition of
legal superiority.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Rank of States.</p></div>
<p>§ 117. Although the States are equals as International
Persons, they are nevertheless not equals as
regards rank. The differences as regards rank are
recognised by International Law, but the legal equality
of States within the Family of Nations is thereby as
little affected as the legal equality of the citizens is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
within a modern State where differences in rank and
titles of the citizens are recognised by Municipal Law.
The vote of a State of lower rank has legally as much
weight as that of a State of higher rank. And the
difference in rank nowadays no longer plays such an
important part as in the past, when questions of etiquette
gave occasion for much dispute. It was in the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries that the rank of the
different States was zealously discussed under the heading
of <i>droit de préséance</i> or <i>questions de préséance</i>. The
Congress at Vienna of 1815 intended to establish an
order of precedence within the Family of Nations, but
dropped this scheme on account of practical difficulties.
Thus the matter is entirely based on custom, which
recognises the following three rules:</p>
<p>(1) <a id="The_States_are_divided_into117"></a>The States are divided into two classes—namely,
States with and States without royal honours. To the
first class belong Empires, Kingdoms, Grand Duchies,
and the great Republics such as France, the United
States of America, Switzerland, the South American
Republics, and others. All other States belong to the
second class. The Holy See is treated as though it
were a State with royal honours. States with royal
honours have exclusively the right to send and receive
diplomatic envoys of the first class<a id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_189_189">[189]</a>—namely, ambassadors;
and their monarchs address one another as
"brothers" in their official letters. States with royal
honours always precede other States.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_189_189"></a><a href="#FNanchor_189_189" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[189]</span></a> See
 below, § <a href="#Ambassadors_form_the_first365" class="pginternal">365</a>.</p></div>
<p>(2) Full-Sovereign States always precede those under
suzerainty or protectorate.</p>
<p>(3) Among themselves States of the same rank do
not precede one another. Empires do not precede
kingdoms, and since the time of Cromwell and the first
French Republic monarchies do not precede republics.
But the Roman Catholic States always concede precedence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
to the Holy See, and the monarchs recognise
among themselves a difference with regard to ceremonials
between emperors and kings on the one hand,
and, on the other, grand dukes and other monarchs.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>The "Alternat."</p></div>
<p>§ 118. To avoid questions of precedence, on signing
a treaty, States of the same rank observe a conventional
usage which is called the "Alternat." According to
that usage the signatures of the signatory States of a
treaty alternate in a regular order or in one determined
by lot, the representative of each State signing first
the copy which belongs to his State. But sometimes
that order is not observed, and the States sign either in
the alphabetical order of their names in French or in
no order at all (<i>pêle-mêle</i>).</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Titles of States.</p></div>
<p>§ 119. <a id="At_the_present_time119"></a>At the present time, States, save in a few
exceptional instances, have no titles, although formerly
such titles did exist. Thus the former Republic of
Venice as well as that of Genoa was addressed as "Serene
Republic," and up to the present day the Republic of
San Marino<a id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_190_190">[190]</a> is addressed as "Most Serene Republic."
Nowadays the titles of the heads of monarchical States
are in so far of importance to International Law as they
are connected with the rank of the respective States.
Since States are Sovereign, they can bestow any titles
they like on their heads. Thus, according to the German
Constitution of 1871, the Kings of Prussia have the title
"German Emperor"; the Kings of England have since
1877 borne the title "Emperor of India"; the Prince
of Servia assumed in 1881, that of Roumania in 1882,
that of Bulgaria in 1908, and that of Montenegro in
1910, the title "King." But no foreign State is obliged
to recognise such a new title, especially when a higher
rank would accrue to the respective State in consequence
of such a new title of its head. In practice such recognition
will regularly be given when the new title really<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
corresponds with the size and the importance of the
respective State.<a id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_191_191">[191]</a> Servia, Roumania, Bulgaria, and
Montenegro had therefore no difficulty in obtaining
recognition as kingdoms.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_190_190"></a><a href="#FNanchor_190_190" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[190]</span></a> See
 Treaty Series, 1900, No. 9.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_191_191"></a><a href="#FNanchor_191_191" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[191]</span></a> History, however, reports several cases where recognition
was withheld for a long time. Thus the title "Emperor of Russia,"
assumed by Peter the Great in 1701, was not recognised by France till
1745, by Spain till 1759, nor by Poland till 1764. And the Pope did not
recognise the kingly title of Prussia, assumed in 1701, till 1786.</p></div>
<p>With the titles of the heads of States are connected
predicates. Emperors and Kings have the predicate
"Majesty," Grand Dukes "Royal Highness," Dukes
"Highness," other monarchs "Serene Highness." The
Pope is addressed as "Holiness" (<i>Sanctitas</i>). Not to
be confounded with these predicates, which are recognised
by the Law of Nations, are predicates which
originally were bestowed on monarchs by the Pope and
which have no importance for the Law of Nations.
Thus the Kings of France called themselves <i>Rex Christianissimus</i>
or "First-born Son of the Church," the
Kings of Spain have called themselves since 1496 <i>Rex
Catholicus</i>, the Kings of England since 1521 <i>Defensor
Fidei</i>, the Kings of Portugal since 1748 <i>Rex Fidelissimus</i>,
the Kings of Hungary since 1758 <i>Rex Apostolicus</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Dignity a Quality.</p></div>
<p>§ 120. The majority of text-book writers maintain
that there is a fundamental right of reputation and of
good name belonging to every State. Such a right,
however, does not exist, because no duty corresponding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
to it can be traced within the Law of Nations. Indeed,
the reputation of a State depends just as much upon
behaviour as that of every citizen within its boundaries.
A State which has a corrupt government and behaves
unfairly and perfidiously in its intercourse with other
States will be looked down upon and despised, whereas
a State which has an uncorrupt government and behaves
fairly and justly in its international dealings will be
highly esteemed. No law can give a good name and
reputation to a rogue, and the Law of Nations does not
and cannot give a right to reputation and good name
to such a State as has not acquired them through its
attitude. There are some States—<i>nomina sunt odiosa!</i>—which
indeed justly possess a bad reputation.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a State as a member of the
Family of Nations possesses dignity as an International
Person. Dignity is a quality recognised by other
States, and it adheres to a State from the moment of
its recognition till the moment of its extinction, whatever
behaviour it displays. Just as the dignity of
every citizen within a State commands a certain amount
of consideration on the part of fellow-citizens, so the
dignity of a State commands a certain amount of consideration
on the part of other States, since otherwise
the different States could not live peaceably in the
community which is called the Family of Nations.</p>

<p>§ 121. <a id="Since_dignity_is_a_recognised121"></a>Since dignity is a recognised quality of States
as International Persons, all members of the Family of
Nations grant reciprocally to one another by custom
certain rights and ceremonial privileges. These are
chiefly the rights to demand—that their heads shall
not be libelled and slandered; that their heads and
likewise their diplomatic envoys shall be granted exterritoriality
and inviolability when abroad, and at
home and abroad in the official intercourse with representatives
of foreign States shall be granted certain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
titles; that their men-of-war shall be granted exterritoriality
when in foreign waters; that their symbols of
authority, such as flags and coats of arms, shall not
be made improper use of and not be treated with disrespect
on the part of other States. Every State must
not only itself comply with the duties corresponding to
these rights of other States, but must also prevent its
subjects from such acts as violate the dignity of foreign
States, and must punish them for acts of that kind which
it could not prevent. The Municipal Laws of all States
must therefore provide for the punishment of those who
commit offences against the dignity of foreign States,<a id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_192_192">[192]</a>
and, if the Criminal Law of the land does not contain
such provisions, it is no excuse for failure by the respective
States to punish offenders. But it must be emphasised
that a State must prevent and punish such acts
only as really violate the dignity of a foreign State.
Mere criticism of policy, historical verdicts concerning
the attitude of States and their rulers, utterances of
moral indignation condemning immoral acts of foreign
Governments and their monarchs need neither be suppressed
nor punished.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_192_192"></a><a href="#FNanchor_192_192" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[192]</span></a> According to the Criminal Law of England, "every one is
guilty of a misdemeanour who publishes any libel tending to degrade,
revile, or expose to hatred and contempt any foreign prince or
potentate, ambassador or other foreign dignitary, with the intent to
disturb peace and friendship between the United Kingdom and the country
to which any such person belongs." See Stephen, "A Digest of the
Criminal Law," article 91.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Maritime

<p>§ 122. <a id="Connected_with_the_dignity122"></a>Connected with the dignity of States are the
maritime ceremonials between vessels and between
vessels and forts which belong to different States. In
former times discord and jealousy existed between the
States regarding such ceremonials, since they were
looked upon as means of keeping up the superiority of
one State over another. Nowadays, so far as the Open
Sea is concerned, they are considered as mere acts of
courtesy recognising the dignity of States. They are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
the outcome of international usages, and not of International

</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Independence and Territorial as well as Personal Supremacy as
Aspects of Sovereignty.</p></div>
<p>§ 123. Sovereignty as supreme authority, which is
independent of any other earthly authority, may be
said to have different aspects. As excluding dependence
from any other authority, and in especial from
the authority of another State, sovereignty is <i>independence</i>.
It is <i>external</i> independence with regard to the
liberty of action outside its borders in the intercourse
with other States which a State enjoys. It is <i>internal</i>
independence with regard to the liberty of action of
a State inside its borders. As comprising the power
of a State to exercise supreme authority over all persons
and things within its territory, sovereignty is <i>territorial</i>
supremacy. As comprising the power of a State
to exercise supreme authority over its citizens at home
and abroad, sovereignty is <i>personal</i> supremacy.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>
<p>For these reasons a State as an International Person
possesses independence and territorial and personal
supremacy. These three qualities are nothing else than
three aspects of the very same sovereignty of a State,
and there is no sharp boundary line between them.
The distinction is apparent and useful, although internal
independence is nothing else than sovereignty comprising
territorial supremacy, but viewed from a different
point of view.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Consequences of Independence and Territorial and Personal
Supremacy.</p></div>
<p>§ 124. <a id="Independence_and_territorial124"></a>Independence and territorial as well as personal
supremacy are not rights, but recognised and
therefore protected qualities of States as International
Persons. The protection granted to these qualities by
the Law of Nations finds its expression in the right of
every State to demand that other States abstain themselves,
and prevent their agents and subjects, from
committing any act which contains a violation of its
independence and its territorial as well as personal
supremacy.</p>
<p>In consequence of its external independence, a State
can manage its international affairs according to discretion,
especially enter into alliances and conclude
other treaties, send and receive diplomatic envoys,
acquire and cede territory, make war and peace.</p>
<p>In consequence of its internal independence and
territorial supremacy, a State can adopt any Constitution
it likes, arrange its administration in a way it
thinks fit, make use of legislature as it pleases, organise
its forces on land and sea, build and pull down fortresses,
adopt any commercial policy it likes, and so
on. According to the rule, <i>quidquid est in territorio est
etiam de territorio</i>, all individuals and all property
within the territory of a State are under the latter's
dominion and sway, and even foreign individuals and
property fall at once under the territorial supremacy
of a State when they cross its frontier. Aliens<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
residing in a State can therefore be compelled to pay
rates and taxes, and to serve in the police under the
same conditions as citizens for the purpose of maintaining
order and safety. But aliens may be expelled, or
not received at all. On the other hand, hospitality may
be granted to them whatever act they have committed
abroad, provided they abstain from making the hospitable
territory the basis for attempts against a foreign
State. And a State can through naturalisation adopt
foreign subjects residing on its territory without the
consent of the home State, provided the individuals
themselves give their consent.</p>
<p>In consequence of its personal supremacy, a State
can treat its subjects according to discretion, and it
retains its power even over such subjects as emigrate
without thereby losing their citizenship. A State may
therefore command its citizens abroad to come home and
fulfil their military service, may require them to pay
rates and taxes for the support of the home finances,
may ask them to comply with certain conditions in case
they desire marriages concluded abroad or wills made
abroad recognised by the home authorities, can punish
them on their return for crimes they have committed
abroad.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Violations of Independence and Territorial and Personal
Supremacy.</p></div>
<p>§ 125. <a id="The_duty_of_every_State125"></a>The duty of every State itself to abstain and
to prevent its agents and subjects from any act which
contains a violation<a id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_195_195">[195]</a> of another State's independence or
territorial and personal supremacy is correlative to the
respective right of the other State. It is impossible
to enumerate all such actions as might contain a violation
of this duty. But it is of value to give some illustrative
examples. Thus, in the interest of the independence
of other States, a State is not allowed to interfere
in the management of their international affairs
nor to prevent them from doing or to compel them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
to do certain acts in their international intercourse.
Further, in the interest of the territorial supremacy of
other States, a State is not allowed to send its troops,
its men-of-war, or its police forces into or through
foreign territory, or to exercise an act of administration
or jurisdiction on foreign territory, without permission.<a id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_196_196">[196]</a>
Again, in the interest of the personal supremacy of
other States, a State is not allowed to naturalise aliens
residing on its territory without their consent,<a id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_197_197">[197]</a> nor to
prevent them from returning home for the purpose of
fulfilling military service or from paying rates and taxes
to their home State, nor to incite citizens of foreign
States to emigration.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_195_195"></a><a href="#FNanchor_195_195" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[195]</span></a> See
 below, § <a href="#International_delinquencies155" class="pginternal">155</a>.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_196_196"></a><a href="#FNanchor_196_196" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[196]</span></a> But
 neighbouring States very often give such permission to
one another. Switzerland, for instance, allows German Custom House
officers to be stationed on two railway stations of Basle for the
purpose of examining the luggage of travellers from Basle to Germany.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_197_197"></a><a href="#FNanchor_197_197" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[197]</span></a> See,
 however, below (§ <a href="#The_most_important299" class="pginternal">299</a>), where the fact is stated that
some States naturalise an alien through the very fact of his taking
domicile on their territory.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Restrictions upon Independence.</p></div>
<p>§ 126. <a id="Independence_is_not126"></a>Independence is not boundless liberty of a
State to do what it likes without any restriction whatever.
The mere fact that a State is a member of the
Family of Nations restricts its liberty of action with
regard to other States because it is bound not to intervene
in the affairs of other States. And it is generally
admitted that a State can through conventions, such as
a treaty of alliance or neutrality and the like, enter into
many obligations which hamper it more or less in the
management of its international affairs. Independence
is a question of degree, and it is therefore also a question
of degree whether the independence of a State is destroyed
or not by certain restrictions. Thus it is generally
admitted that States under suzerainty or under
protectorate are so much restricted that they are not
fully independent, but half-Sovereign. And the same
is the case with the member-States of a Federal State
which are part-Sovereign. On the other hand, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
restriction connected with the neutralisation of States
does not, according to the correct opinion,<a id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_198_198">[198]</a> destroy
their independence, although they cannot make war
except in self-defence, cannot conclude alliances, and
are in other ways hampered in their liberty of action.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_198_198"></a><a href="#FNanchor_198_198" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[198]</span></a> See
 above, § <a href="#Since_a_neutralised97" class="pginternal">97</a>.</p></div>
<p>From a political and a legal point of view it is of
great importance that the States imposing and those
accepting restrictions upon independence should be
clear in their intentions. For the question may arise
whether these restrictions make the respective State a
dependent one.</p>
<p>Thus through article 4 of the Convention of London
of 1884 between Great Britain and the former South
African Republic stipulating that the latter should
not conclude any treaty with any foreign State, the
Orange Free State excepted, without approval on the
part of Great Britain, the Republic was so much restricted
that Great Britain considered herself justified
in defending the opinion that the Republic was not
an independent State, although the Republic itself and
many writers were of a different opinion.<a id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_199_199">[199]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_199_199"></a><a href="#FNanchor_199_199" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[199]</span></a> It is of interest to state the fact that, before the last
phase of the conflict between Great Britain and the Republic,
influential Continental writers stated the suzerainty of Great Britain
over the Republic. See Rivier, I. p. 89, and Holtzendorff in
Holtzendorff, II. p. 115.</p></div>
<p>Thus, to give another example, through article 1 of
the Treaty of Havana<a id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_200_200">[200]</a> of May 22, 1903, between the
United States of America and Cuba, stipulating that
Cuba shall never enter into any such treaty with a
foreign Power as will impair, or tend to impair, the
independence of Cuba, and shall abstain from other
acts, the Republic of Cuba is so much restricted that
some writers maintain—wrongly, I believe—that Cuba
is under an American protectorate and only a half-Sovereign
State.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_200_200"></a><a href="#FNanchor_200_200" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[200]</span></a> See
 Martens, N.R.G. 2nd Ser. XXXII. (1905), p. 79. As
regards the international position of Cuba, see Whitcomb, "La situation
internationale de Cuba" (1905).<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p></div>
<p>Again, the Republic of Panama is, by the Treaty of
Washington<a id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_201_201">[201]</a> of 1904, likewise burdened with some
restrictions in favour of the United States, but here,
too, it would be wrong to maintain that Panama is
under an American protectorate.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_201_201"></a><a href="#FNanchor_201_201" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[201]</span></a> See
 Martens, N.R.G. 2nd Ser. XXXI. (1905), p. 601.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Restrictions upon Territorial Supremacy.</p></div>
<p>§ 127. <a id="Just_like_independence127"></a>Just like independence, territorial supremacy
does not give a boundless liberty of action. Thus, by
customary International Law every State has a right
to demand that its merchantmen can pass through the
maritime belt of other States. Thus, further, navigation
on so-called international rivers in Europe must
be open to merchantmen of all States. Thus, thirdly,
foreign monarchs and envoys, foreign men-of-war, and
foreign armed forces must be granted exterritoriality.
Thus, fourthly, through the right of protection over
citizens abroad which is held by every State according
to customary International Law, a State cannot treat
foreign citizens passing through or residing on its territory
arbitrarily according to discretion as it might treat
its own subjects; it cannot, for instance, compel them to
serve<a id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_202_202">[202]</a> in its army or navy. Thus, to give another and
fifth example, a State, in spite of its territorial supremacy,
is not allowed to alter the natural conditions of
its own territory to the disadvantage of the natural
conditions of the territory of a neighbouring State—for
instance, to stop or to divert the flow of a river which
runs from its own into neighbouring territory.<a id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_203_203">[203]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_202_202"></a><a href="#FNanchor_202_202" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[202]</span></a> Great Britain would seem to uphold an exception to this
rule, for Lord Reay, one of her delegates, declared—see "Deuxième
Conférence Internationale de la Paix, Actes et Documents," vol. III. p.
41—the following at the second Hague Peace Conference of 1907: "Nous
reconnaissons qu'en règle générale le neutre est exempt de tout service
militaire dans l'Etat où il réside. Cependant dans les colonies
britanniques et, dans une certaine mesure, dans tous les pays en voie de
formation, la situation est tout autre et la population toute entière,
sans distinction de nationalité, peut être appelée sous les armes pour
défendre leurs foyers menacés."</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_203_203"></a><a href="#FNanchor_203_203" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[203]</span></a> See
 below, § <a href="#Apart_from_navigation178a" class="pginternal">178 <i>a</i></a>.</p></div>
<p>In contradistinction to these restrictions by the
customary Law of Nations, a State can through treaties<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
enter into obligations of many a kind without thereby
losing its internal independence and territorial supremacy.
Thus France by three consecutive treaties of
peace—namely, that of Utrecht of 1713, that of Aix-la-Chapelle
of 1748, and that of Paris of 1763—entered
into the obligation to pull down and not to rebuild the
fortifications of Dunkirk.<a id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_204_204">[204]</a> Napoleon I. imposed by
the Peace Treaty of Tilsit of 1807 upon Prussia the
restriction not to keep more than 42,000 men under
arms. Again, article 29 of the Treaty of Berlin of 1878
imposed upon Montenegro the restriction not to possess
a navy.<a id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_205_205">[205]</a> There is hardly a State in existence which is
not in one point or another restricted in its territorial
supremacy by treaties with foreign Powers.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_204_204"></a><a href="#FNanchor_204_204" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[204]</span></a> This restriction was abolished by article 17 of the Treaty
of Paris of 1783.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_205_205"></a><a href="#FNanchor_205_205" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[205]</span></a> It is doubtful whether this restriction is still in force;
see below, § <a href="#Since_no_State_can258" class="pginternal">258</a>.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Restrictions upon Personal Supremacy.</p></div>
<p>§ 128. <a id="Personal_Supremacy_does_not128"></a>Personal Supremacy does not give a boundless
liberty of action either. Although the citizens of
a State remain under its power when abroad, such
State is restricted in the exercise of this power with
regard to all those matters in which the foreign State
on whose territory these citizens reside is competent
in consequence of its territorial supremacy. The duty
to respect the territorial supremacy of a foreign State
must prevent a State from doing all acts which, although
they are according to its personal supremacy
within its competence, would violate the territorial
supremacy of this foreign State. Thus, for instance, a
State is prevented from requiring such acts from its
citizens abroad as are forbidden to them by the Municipal
Law of the land in which they reside.</p>
<p>But a State may also by treaty obligation be for
some parts restricted in the liberty of action with
regard to its citizens. Thus articles 5, 25, 35, and 44
of the Treaty of Berlin of 1878 restrict the personal
supremacy of Bulgaria, Montenegro, Servia, and Roumania<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
in so far as these States are thereby obliged not
to impose any religious disabilities on any of their

<div class="sidenote"><p>Self-preservation an excuse for violations.</p></div>
<p>§ 129. <a id="Fr129"></a>From the earliest time of the existence of
the Law of Nations self-preservation was considered
sufficient justification for many acts of a State which
violate other States. Although, as a rule, all States
have mutually to respect one another's Personality
and are therefore bound not to violate one another, as
an exception, certain violations of another State committed
by a State for the purpose of self-preservation
are not prohibited by the Law of Nations. Thus,
self-preservation is a factor of great importance for
the position of the States within the Family of
Nations, and most writers maintain that every State
has a fundamental right of self-preservation.<a id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_207_207">[207]</a> But
nothing of the kind is actually the case, if the real facts
of the law are taken into consideration. If every State
really had a <i>right</i> of self-preservation, all the States
would have the duty to admit, suffer, and endure every
violation done to one another in self-preservation. But
such duty does not exist. On the contrary, although<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
self-preservation is in certain cases an excuse recognised
by International Law, no State is obliged patiently to
submit to violations done to it by such other State as
acts in self-preservation, but can repulse them. It is
a fact that in certain cases violations committed in
self-preservation are not prohibited by the Law of
Nations. But, nevertheless, they remain violations and
can therefore be repulsed. Self-preservation is consequently
an excuse, because violations of other States are
in certain exceptional cases not prohibited when they
are committed for the purpose and in the interest of
self-preservation, although they need not patiently be
suffered and endured by the States concerned.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_207_207"></a><a href="#FNanchor_207_207" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[207]</span></a> This right was formerly frequently called <i>droit de
convenance</i>, and was said to exist in the right of every State to act in
favour of its interests in case of a conflict between its own and the
interests of another State. See Heffter, § 26.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>What acts of self-preservation are excused.</p></div>
<p>§ 130. <a id="It130"></a>It is frequently maintained that every violation
is excused so long as it was caused by the motive
of self-preservation, but it becomes more and more
recognised that violations of other States in the interest
of self-preservation are excused in cases of <i>necessity</i>
only. Such acts of violence in the interest of self-preservation
are exclusively excused as are necessary
in self-defence, because otherwise the acting State
would have to suffer or have to continue to suffer a
violation against itself. If an imminent violation or
the continuation of an already commenced violation
can be prevented and redressed otherwise than by a
violation of another State on the part of the endangered
State, this latter violation is not necessary, and therefore
not excused and justified. When, to give an example,
a State is informed that on neighbouring territory
a body of armed men is being organised for the purpose
of a raid into its own territory, and when the danger
can be removed through an appeal to the authorities
of the neighbouring country, no case of necessity has
arisen. But if such an appeal is fruitless or not possible,
or if there is danger in delay, a case of necessity
arises and the threatened State is justified in invading<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
the neighbouring country and disarming the intending
raiders.</p>
<p>The reason of the thing, of course, makes it necessary
for every State to judge for itself when it considers
a case of necessity has arisen, and it is therefore impossible
to lay down a hard-and-fast rule regarding the
question when a State can or cannot have recourse
to self-help which violates another State. Everything
depends upon the circumstances and conditions of the
special case, and it is therefore of value to give some
historical examples.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Case of the Danish Fleet (1807).</p></div>
<p>§ 131. After the Peace of Tilsit of 1807 the British
Government<a id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_208_208">[208]</a> was cognisant of the provision of some
secret articles of this treaty that France should be at
liberty to seize the Danish fleet and to make use of
it against Great Britain. This plan, when carried out,
would have endangered the position of Great Britain,
which was then waging war against France. As Denmark
was not capable of defending herself against an
attack of the French army in North Germany under
Bernadotte and Davoust, who had orders to invade
Denmark, the British Government requested Denmark
to deliver up her fleet to the custody of Great Britain,
and promised to restore it after the war. And at the
same time the means of defence against French invasion
and a guaranty of her whole possessions were offered
to Denmark by England. The latter, however, refused
to comply with the British demands, whereupon the
British considered a case of necessity in self-preservation
had arisen, shelled Copenhagen, and seized the
Danish fleet.</p>

hundreds of insurgents got hold of an island in the river
Niagara, on the territory of the United States, and with
the help of American subjects equipped a boat called
the <i>Caroline</i>, with the purpose of crossing into
Canadian territory and bringing material help to the
insurgents. The Canadian Government, timely informed
of the imminent danger, sent a British force over into
the American territory, which obtained possession of
the <i>Caroline</i>, seized her arms, and then sent her
adrift down the falls of the Niagara. The United States
complained of this British violation of her territorial
supremacy, but Great Britain was in a position to prove
that her act was necessary in self-preservation, since
there was not sufficient time to prevent the imminent
invasion of her territory through application to the
United States Government.<a id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_210_210">[210]</a></p>

others quote also the case of the <i>Virginius</i> (1873) as an example of
necessity of self-preservation, but it seems that the Spanish Government
did not plead self-preservation but piracy as justification of the
capture of the vessel (see Moore, II. § 309, pp. 895-903). That a vessel
sailing under another State's flag can nevertheless be seized on the
high seas in case she is sailing to a port of the capturing State for
the purpose of an invasion or bringing material help to insurgents,
there is no doubt. No better case of necessity of self-preservation
could be given, since the danger is imminent and can be frustrated only
by capture of the vessel.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Conception and character of Intervention.</p></div>
<p>§ 134. <a id="Intervention_is134"></a>Intervention is dictatorial interference by a
State in the affairs of another State for the purpose of
maintaining or altering the actual condition of things.
Such intervention can take place by right or without
a right, but it always concerns the external independence
or the territorial or personal supremacy of the
respective State, and the whole matter is therefore of
great importance for the position of the States within
the Family of Nations. That intervention is, as a rule,
forbidden by the Law of Nations which protects the
International Personality of the States, there is no
doubt. On the other hand, there is just as little doubt<a id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_211_211">[211]</a>
that this rule has exceptions, for there are interventions
which take place by right, and there are others which,
although they do not take place by right, are nevertheless
admitted by the Law of Nations and are excused
in spite of the violation of the Personality of the respective
States they involve.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_211_211"></a><a href="#FNanchor_211_211" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[211]</span></a> The so-called doctrine of non-intervention as defended by
some Italian writers (see Fiore, I. No. 565), who deny that intervention
is ever justifiable, is a political doctrine without any legal basis
whatever.</p></div>
<p>Intervention can take place in the external as well<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
as in the internal affairs of a State. It concerns in the
first case the external independence, and in the second
either the territorial or the personal supremacy. But
it must be emphasised that intervention proper is always
<i>dictatorial</i> interference, not interference pure and simple.<a id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_212_212">[212]</a>
Therefore intervention must neither be confounded with
good offices, nor with mediation, nor with intercession,
nor with co-operation, because none of these imply a
<i>dictatorial</i> interference. Good offices is the name for
such acts of friendly Powers interfering in a conflict
between two other States as tend to call negotiations into
existence for the peaceable settlement of the conflict,
and mediation is the name for the direct conduct on
the part of a friendly Power of such negotiations.<a id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_213_213">[213]</a>
Intercession is the name for the interference consisting
in friendly advice given or friendly offers made with
regard to the domestic affairs of another State. And,
lastly, co-operation is the appellation of such interference
as consists in help and assistance lent by one
State to another at the latter's request for the purpose
of suppressing an internal revolution. Thus, for example,
Russia sent troops in 1849, at the request of
Austria, into Hungary to assist Austria in suppressing
the Hungarian revolt.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_212_212"></a><a href="#FNanchor_212_212" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[212]</span></a> Many writers constantly commit this confusion.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_213_213"></a><a href="#FNanchor_213_213" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[213]</span></a> See
 below, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41047/41047-h/41047-h.htm#Di9" class="pgexternal" id="id-8976437018801675842">vol. II. § 9</a>.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Intervention by Right.</p></div>
<p>§ 135. <a id="It_is_apparent135"></a>It is apparent that such interventions as take
place by right must be distinguished from others.
Wherever there is no right of intervention, although it
may be admissible and excused, an intervention violates
either the external independence or the territorial or
the personal supremacy. But if an intervention takes
place by right, it never contains such a violation, because
the right of intervention is always based on a
legal restriction upon the independence or territorial or
personal supremacy of the State concerned, and because<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
the latter is in duty bound to submit to the intervention.
Now a State may have a right of intervention against
another State, mainly for six reasons:<a id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_214_214">[214]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_214_214"></a><a href="#FNanchor_214_214" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[214]</span></a> The enumeration is not intended to be exhaustive.</p></div>
<p>(1) A Suzerain State has a right to intervene in
many affairs of the Vassal, and a State which holds a
protectorate has a right to intervene in all the external
affairs of the protected State.</p>
<p>(2) <a id="If_an_external_affair2of135"></a>If an external affair of a State is at the same
time by right an affair of another State, the latter has
a right to intervene in case the former deals with that
affair unilaterally. The events of 1878 provide an
illustrative example. Russia had concluded the preliminary
Peace of San Stefano with defeated Turkey;
Great Britain protested because the conditions of this
peace were inconsistent with the Treaty of Paris of 1856
and the Convention of London of 1871, and Russia
agreed to the meeting of the Congress of Berlin for the
purpose of arranging matters. Had Russia persisted
in carrying out the preliminary peace, Great Britain as
well as other signatory Powers of the Treaty of Paris
and the Convention of London doubtless possessed a
right of intervention.</p>
<p>(3) If a State which is restricted by an international
treaty in its external independence or its territorial or
personal supremacy does not comply with the restrictions
concerned, the other party or parties have a right
to intervene. Thus the United States of America, in
1906, exercised intervention in Cuba in conformity with
article 3 of the Treaty of Havana<a id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_215_215">[215]</a> of 1903, which
stipulates: "The Government of Cuba consents that the
United States may exercise the right to intervene for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
the preservation of Cuban independence, the maintenance
of a Government adequate for the protection of
life, property, and individual liberty...." And likewise
the United States of America, in 1904, exercised
intervention in Panama in conformity with article 7
of the Treaty of Washington<a id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_216_216">[216]</a> in 1903, which stipulates:
"The same right and authority are granted to the
United States for the maintenance of public order in
the cities of Panama and Colon and the territories and
harbours adjacent thereto in case the Republic of
Panama should not be, in the judgment of the United
States, able to maintain such order."</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_215_215"></a><a href="#FNanchor_215_215" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[215]</span></a> See
 Martens, N.R.G. 2nd Ser. XXXII. (1905), p. 79.—Even if
no special right of intervention is stipulated, it nevertheless exists
in such cases. Thus—see
 below, § <a href="#Treaties_of_guarantee574" class="pginternal">574</a>—those Powers which have
guaranteed the integrity of Norway under the condition that she does not
cede any part of her territory to any foreign Power would have a right
to intervene in case such a cession were contemplated, although the
treaty concerned does not stipulate this.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_216_216"></a><a href="#FNanchor_216_216" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[216]</span></a> See
 Martens, N.R.G. 2nd Ser. XXXI. (1905), p. 599.</p></div>
<p>(4) <a id="If4of135"></a>If a State in time of peace or war violates such
rules of the Law of Nations as are universally recognised
by custom or are laid down in law-making treaties,
other States have a right to intervene and to make the
delinquent submit to the rules concerned. If, for instance,
a State undertook to extend its jurisdiction over
the merchantmen of another State on the high seas,
not only would this be an affair between the two States
concerned, but all other States would have a right to
intervene because the freedom of the open sea is a universally
recognised principle. Or if a State which is a
party to the Hague Regulations concerning Land Warfare
were to violate one of these Regulations, all the
other signatory Powers would have a right to intervene.</p>
<p>(5) A State that has guaranteed by treaty the form
of government of a State or the reign of a certain dynasty
over the same has a right<a id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_217_217">[217]</a> to intervene in case of change
of form of government or of dynasty, provided the
respective treaty of guaranty was concluded between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
the respective States and not between their monarchs
personally.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_217_217"></a><a href="#FNanchor_217_217" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[217]</span></a> But this is not generally recognised; see,
 for instance,
Hall, § 93, who denies the existence of such a right. I do not see the
reason why a State should not be able to undertake the obligation to
retain a certain form of government or dynasty. That historical events
can justify such State in considering itself no longer bound by such
treaty according to the principle <i>rebus sic stantibus</i> (see
 below, § <a href="#Although_as_just_stated539" class="pginternal">539</a>)
 is another matter.</p></div>
<p>(6) <a id="The_right_of_pro6of135"></a>The right of protection<a id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_218_218">[218]</a> over citizens abroad,
which a State holds, may cause an intervention by right
to which the other party is legally bound to submit.
And it matters not whether protection of the life,
security, honour, or property of a citizen abroad is concerned.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_218_218"></a><a href="#FNanchor_218_218" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[218]</span></a> See
 below, § <a href="#Although_aliens319" class="pginternal">319</a>.</p></div>
<p>The so-called <i>Drago<a id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_219_219">[219]</a> doctrine</i>, which asserts the rule
that intervention is not allowed for the purpose of
making a State pay its public debts, is unfounded, and
has not received general recognition, although Argentina
and some other South American States tried to
establish this rule at the second Hague Peace Conference
of 1907. But this Conference adopted, on the
initiative of the United States of America, a "Convention<a id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_220_220">[220]</a>
respecting the Limitation of the Employment of
Force for the Recovery of Contract Debts." According
to article 1 of this Convention, the contracting Powers
agree not to have recourse to armed force for the recovery
of contract debts claimed from the Government
of one country by the Government of another country
as being due to its nationals. This undertaking is,
however, not applicable when the debtor State refuses
or neglects to reply to an offer of arbitration, or, after
accepting the offer, renders the settlement of the <i>compromis</i>
impossible, or, after the arbitration, fails to
submit to the award.—It must be emphasised that the
stipulations of this Convention concern the recovery of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
all contract debts, whether or no they arise from public
loans.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_219_219"></a><a href="#FNanchor_219_219" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[219]</span></a> The Drago doctrine originates from Louis M. Drago, sometime
Foreign Secretary of the Republic of Argentina. See Drago, "Cobro
coercitivo de deudas publicas" (1906); Barclay, "Problems of
International Practice, &amp;c." (1907), pp. 115-122; Moulin, "La Doctrine

<div class="sidenote"><p>Admissibility of Intervention in default of Right.</p></div>
<p>§ 136. <a id="In_contradistinction136"></a>In contradistinction to intervention by right,
there are other interventions which must be considered
admissible, although they violate the independence or
the territorial or personal supremacy of the State concerned,
and although such State has by no means any
legal duty to submit patiently and suffer the intervention.
Of such interventions in default of right there
are two kinds generally admitted and excused—namely,
such as are necessary in self-preservation and such as
are necessary in the interest of the balance of power.</p>
<p>(1) As regards interventions for the purpose of self-preservation,
it is obvious that, if any necessary violation
committed in self-preservation of the International
Personality of other States is, as shown above (§ 130),
excused, such violation must also be excused as is contained
in an intervention. And it matters not whether
such an intervention exercised in self-preservation is
provoked by an actual or imminent intervention on the
part of a third State, or by some other incident.</p>
<p>(2) As regards intervention in the interest of the
balance of power, it is likewise obvious that it must
be excused. An equilibrium between the members of
the Family of Nations is an indispensable<a id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_221_221">[221]</a> condition of
the very existence of International Law. If the States
could not keep one another in check, all Law of Nations
would soon disappear, as, naturally, an over-powerful
State would tend to act according to discretion instead
of according to law. Since the Westphalian Peace of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
1648 the principle of balance of power has played a
preponderant part in the history of Europe. It found
express recognition in 1713 in the Treaty of Peace of
Utrecht, it was the guiding star at the Vienna Congress
in 1815 when the map of Europe was rearranged, at
the Congress of Paris in 1856, the Conference of London
in 1867, and the Congress of Berlin in 1878. The States
themselves and the majority of writers agree upon the
admissibility of intervention in the interest of balance
of power. Most of the interventions exercised in the
interest of the preservation of the Turkish Empire must,
in so far as they are not based on treaty rights, be
classified as interventions in the interest of balance of
power. Examples of this are supplied by collective
interventions exercised by the Powers in 1886 for the
purpose of preventing the outbreak of war between
Greece and Turkey, and in 1897 during the war between
Greece and Turkey with regard to the island of Crete.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_221_221"></a><a href="#FNanchor_221_221" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[221]</span></a> A survey of the opinions concerning the value of the
principle of balance of power is given by Bulmerincq, "Praxis, Theorie
und Codification des Völkerrechts" (1874), pp. 40-50, but Bulmerincq
himself rejects the principle. See also Donnadieu, "Essai sur la théorie
de l'équilibre" (1900) where the matter is exhaustively treated, and
Dupuis, "Le principe d'équilibre et le concert européen" (1909), pp.
90-108, and 494-513. It is necessary to emphasise that the principle of
the balance of power is not a legal principle and therefore not one of
International Law, but one of International policy; it is a political
principle indispensable to the existence of International Law in its
present condition.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Intervention in the interest of Humanity.</p></div>
<p>§ 137. <a id="Ma137"></a>Many jurists maintain that intervention is
likewise admissible, or even has a basis of right, when
exercised in the interest of humanity for the purpose of
stopping religious persecution and endless cruelties in
time of peace and war. That the Powers have in the
past exercised intervention on these grounds, there is
no doubt. Thus Great Britain, France, and Russia
intervened in 1827 in the struggle between revolutionary
Greece and Turkey, because public opinion was horrified
at the cruelties committed during this struggle.
And many a time interventions have taken place to
stop the persecution of Christians in Turkey. But
whether there is really a rule of the Law of Nations
which admits such interventions may well be doubted.
Yet, on the other hand, it cannot be denied that public
opinion and the attitude of the Powers are in favour
of such interventions, and it may perhaps be said that
in time the Law of Nations will recognise the rule that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
interventions in the interests of humanity are admissible
provided they are exercised in the form of a
collective intervention of the Powers.<a id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_222_222">[222]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Intervention <i>de facto</i> a Matter of Policy.</p></div>
<p>§ 138. Careful analysis of the rules of the Law of
Nations regarding intervention and the hitherto exercised
practice of intervention make it apparent that
intervention is <i>de facto</i> a matter of policy just like war.
This is the result of the combination of several factors.
Since, even in the cases in which it is based on a right,
intervention is not compulsory, but is solely in the discretion
of the State concerned, it is for that reason alone
a matter of policy. Since, secondly, every State must
decide for itself whether vital interests of its own are
at stake and whether a case of necessity in the interest
of self-preservation has arisen, intervention is for this
part again a matter of policy. Since, thirdly, the question
of balance of power is so complicated and the historical
development of the States involves gradually an
alteration of the division of power between the States,
it must likewise be left to the appreciation of every
State whether or not it considers the balance of power
endangered and, therefore, an intervention necessary.
And who can undertake to lay down a hard-and-fast rule
with regard to the amount of inhumanity on the part
of a Government that would justify intervention according
to the Law of Nations?</p>
<p>No State will ever intervene in the affairs of another
if it has not some important interest in doing so, and it
has always been easy for such State to find or pretend
some legal justification for an intervention, be it self-preservation,
balance of power, or humanity. There is
no great danger to the welfare of the States in the fact
that intervention is <i>de facto</i> a matter of policy. Too
many interests are common to all the members of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
Family of Nations, and too great is the natural jealousy
between the Great Powers, for an abuse of intervention
on the part of one powerful State without calling other
States into the field. Since unjustified intervention
violates the very principles of the Law of Nations, and
since, as I have stated above <a href="#It_is_apparent135" class="pginternal">(§ 135)</a>, in case of a violation
of these principles on the part of a State every
other State has a right to intervene, any unjustifiable
intervention by one State in the affairs of another gives
a right of intervention to all other States. Thus it
becomes apparent here, as elsewhere, that the Law of
Nations is intimately connected with the interests of
all the States, and that they must themselves secure
the maintenance and realisation of this law. This condition
of things tends naturally to hamper more the
ambitions of weaker States than those of the several
Great Powers, but it seems unalterable.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>The Monroe Doctrine.</p></div>
<p>§ 139. <a id="The139"></a>The <i>de facto</i> political character of the whole
matter of intervention becomes clearly apparent through
the so-called Monroe doctrine<a id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_223_223">[223]</a> of the United States of
America. This doctrine, at its first appearance, was indirectly
a product of the policy of intervention in the
interest of legitimacy which the Holy Alliance pursued
in the beginning of the nineteenth century after the
downfall of Napoleon. The Powers of this alliance were
inclined to extend their policy of intervention to America
and to assist Spain in regaining her hold over the former
Spanish colonies in South America which had declared
and maintained their independence, and which were
recognised as independent Sovereign States by the
United States of America. To meet and to check the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
imminent danger, President James Monroe delivered his
celebrated Message to Congress on December 2, 1823.
This Message contains two quite different, but nevertheless
equally important, declarations.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_223_223"></a><a href="#FNanchor_223_223" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[223]</span></a> Wharton, § 57; Dana's Note No. 36 to Wharton, p. 36;
Tucker, "The Monroe Doctrine" (1885); Moore, "The Monroe Doctrine"
(1895), and Digest, VI. §§ 927-968; Cespedès, "La doctrine de Monroe"
(1893); Mérignhac, "La doctrine de Monroe à la fin du XIX^e siècle"
(1896); Beaumarchais, "La doctrine de Monroe" (1898); Redaway, "The
Monroe Doctrine" (1898); Pékin, "Les États-Unis et la doctrine de
Monroe" (1900).</p></div>
<p>(1) In connection with the unsettled boundary lines
in the north-west of the American continent, the Message
declared "that the American continents, by the
free and independent condition which they have assumed
and maintained, are henceforth not to be considered
as subjects for future colonisation by any European
Power." This declaration was never recognised by
the European Powers, and Great Britain and Russia
protested expressly against it. In fact, however, no
occupation of American territory has since then taken
place on the part of a European State.</p>
<p>(2) In regard to the contemplated intervention of
the Holy Alliance between Spain and the South American
States, the Message declared that the United States
had not intervened, and never would intervene, in wars
in Europe, but could not, on the other hand, in the
interest of her own peace and happiness, allow the allied
European Powers to extend their political system to
any part of America and try to intervene in the independence
of the South American republics.</p>
<p>(3) Since the time of President Monroe, the Monroe
doctrine has been gradually somewhat extended in so
far as the United States claims a kind of political hegemony
over all the States of the American continent.
Whenever a conflict occurs between such an American
State and a European Power, the United States is ready
to exercise intervention. Through the civil war her
hands were to a certain extent bound in the sixties of
the last century, and she could not prevent the occupation
of Mexico by the French army, but she intervened<a id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_224_224">[224]</a>
in 1865. Again, she did not intervene in 1902<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
when Great Britain, Germany, and Italy took combined
action against Venezuela, because she was cognisant
of the fact that this action intended merely to make
Venezuela comply with her international duties. But
she intervened in 1896 in the boundary conflict between
Great Britain and Venezuela when Lord Salisbury had
sent an <i>ultimatum</i> to Venezuela, and she retains the
Monroe doctrine as a matter of principle.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_224_224"></a><a href="#FNanchor_224_224" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[224]</span></a> See
 Moore, VI. § 957.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Merits of the Monroe Doctrine.</p></div>
<p>§ 140. The importance of the Monroe doctrine is of
a political, not of a legal character. Since the Law of
Nations is a law between all the civilised States as equal
members of the Family of Nations, the States of the
American continent are subjects of the same international
rights and duties as the European States.
The European States are, as far as the Law of Nations
is concerned, absolutely free to acquire territory in
America as elsewhere. And the same legal rules are
valid concerning intervention on the part of European
Powers both in American affairs and in affairs of other
States. But it is evident that the Monroe doctrine, as
the guiding star of the policy of the United States, is
of the greatest <i>political</i> importance. And it ought not
to be maintained that this policy is in any way inconsistent
with the Law of Nations. In the interest of
balance of power in the world, the United States considers
it a necessity that European Powers should not
acquire more territory on the American continent than
they actually possess. She considers, further, her own
welfare so intimately connected with that of the other
American States that she thinks it necessary, in the
interest of self-preservation, to watch closely the relations
of these States with Europe and also the relations
between these very States, and eventually to intervene
in conflicts. Since every State must decide for itself
whether and where vital interests of its own are at stake
and whether the balance of power is endangered to its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
disadvantage, and since, as explained above (§ 138),
intervention is therefore <i>de facto</i> a matter of policy,
there is no legal impediment to the United States carrying
out a policy in conformity with the Monroe doctrine.
This policy hampers indeed the South American States,
but with their growing strength it will gradually disappear.
For, whenever some of these States become
Great Powers themselves, they will no longer submit
to the political hegemony of the United States, and the
Monroe doctrine will have played its part.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Intercourse a presupposition of International Personality.</p></div>
<p>§ 141. <a id="Many_adherents_of_the141"></a>Many adherents of the doctrine of fundamental
rights include therein also a right of intercourse
of every State with all others. This right of intercourse
is said to contain a right of diplomatic, commercial,
postal, telegraphic intercourse, of intercourse by railway,
a right of foreigners to travel and reside on the
territory of every State, and the like. But if the real
facts of international life are taken into consideration,
it becomes at once apparent that such a fundamental
right of intercourse does not exist. All the consequences
which are said to follow from the right of
intercourse are not at all consequences of a right,
but nothing else than consequences of the fact that
intercourse between the States is a condition without
which a Law of Nations would not and could not exist.
The civilised States make a community of States because<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
they are knit together through their common interests
and the manifold intercourse which serves these interests.
Through intercourse with one another and
with the growth of their common interests the Law of
Nations has grown up among the civilised States.
Where there is no intercourse there cannot be a community
and a law for such community. A State cannot
be a member of the Family of Nations and an International
Person, if it has no intercourse whatever with
at least one or more other States. Varied intercourse
with other States is a necessity for every civilised
State. The mere fact that a State is a member of the
Family of Nations shows that it has various intercourse
with other States, for otherwise it would never
have become a member of that family. Intercourse is
therefore one of the characteristics of the position of
the States within the Family of Nations, and it may be
maintained that intercourse is a presupposition of the
international Personality of every State. But no special
right or rights of intercourse between the States exist
according to the Law of Nations. It is because such
special rights of intercourse do not exist that the States
conclude special treaties regarding matters of post,
telegraphs, telephones, railways, and commerce. On
the other hand, most States keep up protective duties
to exclude or hamper foreign trade in the interest of
their home commerce, industry, and agriculture. And
although as a rule they allow<a id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_225_225">[225]</a> aliens to travel and
to reside on their territory, they can expel every foreign
subject according to discretion.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_225_225"></a><a href="#FNanchor_225_225" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[225]</span></a> That an alien has no right to
demand to be admitted to British
territory was decided in the case of

<p>§ 142. <a id="Intercourse_being_a_presupposition142"></a>Intercourse being a presupposition of International
Personality, the Law of Nations favours intercourse
in every way. The whole institution of legation
serves the interest of intercourse between the States,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
as does the consular institution. The right of legation,<a id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_226_226">[226]</a>
which every full-Sovereign State undoubtedly holds, is
held in the interest of intercourse, as is certainly the
right of protection over citizens abroad<a id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_227_227">[227]</a> which every

freedom of navigation for the merchantmen of all nations
on so-called international rivers,<a id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_230_230">[230]</a> are further examples

<p>The question is frequently discussed and answered
in the affirmative whether a State has the right to
require such States as are outside the Family of Nations
to open their ports and allow commercial intercourse.
Since the Law of Nations is a law between those States
only which are members of the Family of Nations, it
has certainly nothing to do with this question, which
is therefore one of mere commercial policy and of
morality.</p>

<p>§ 143. Jurisdiction is for several reasons a matter
of importance as regards the position of the States
within the Family of Nations. States possessing independence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
and territorial as well as personal supremacy
can naturally extend or restrict their jurisdiction as far
as they like. However, as members of the Family of
Nations and International Persons, the States must
exercise self-restraint in the exercise of this natural
power in the interest of one another. Since intercourse
of all kinds takes place between the States and their
subjects, the matter ought to be thoroughly regulated
by the Law of Nations. But such regulation has as
yet only partially grown up. The consequence of both
the regulation and non-regulation of jurisdiction is that
concurrent jurisdiction of several States can often at
the same time be exercised over the same persons and
matters. And it can also happen that matters fall
under no jurisdiction because the several States which
could extend their jurisdiction over these matters refuse
to do so, leaving them to each other's jurisdiction.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Restrictions upon Territorial Jurisdiction.</p></div>
<p>§ 144. As all persons and things within the territory

<div class="sidenote"><p>Jurisdiction over Citizens abroad.</p></div>
<p>§ 145. The Law of Nations does not prevent a State
from exercising jurisdiction over its subjects travelling
or residing abroad, since they remain under its personal
supremacy. As every State can also exercise<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
jurisdiction over aliens<a id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_236_236">[236]</a> within its boundaries, such
aliens are often under two concurrent jurisdictions.
And, since a State is not obliged to exercise jurisdiction
for all matters over aliens on its territory, and since
the home State is not obliged to exercise jurisdiction
over its subjects abroad, it may and does happen that
aliens are actually for some matters under no State's
jurisdiction.</p>

<p>§ 146. <a id="As146"></a>As the Open Sea is not under the sway of
any State, no State can exercise its jurisdiction there.
But it is a rule of the Law of Nations that the vessels
and the things and persons thereon remain during the
time they are on the Open Sea under the jurisdiction
of the State under whose flag they sail.<a id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_237_237">[237]</a> It is another
rule of the Law of Nations that piracy<a id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_238_238">[238]</a> on the Open

the pirate sails under the flag of a State. Further,<a id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_239_239">[239]</a>
a general practice seems to admit the claim of every
maritime State to exercise jurisdiction over cases of
collision at sea, whether the vessels concerned are or
are not sailing under its flag. Again, in the interest
of the safety of the Open Sea, every State has the right
to order its men-of-war to ask any suspicious merchantman
they meet on the Open Sea to show the flag, to
arrest foreign merchantmen sailing under its flag without
an authorisation for its use, and to pursue into the
Open Sea and to arrest there such foreign merchantmen
as have committed a violation of its law whilst in its
ports or maritime belt.<a id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_240_240">[240]</a> Lastly, in time of war belligerent

<p>§ 147. Many States claim jurisdiction and threaten<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
punishment for certain acts committed by a foreigner
in foreign countries.<a id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_241_241">[241]</a> States which claim jurisdiction
of this kind threaten punishment for certain acts either
against the State itself, such as high treason, forging
bank-notes, and the like, or against its citizens, such as
murder or arson, libel and slander, and the like. These
States cannot, of course, exercise this jurisdiction as
long as the foreigner concerned remains outside their
territory. But if, after the committal of such act, he
enters their territory and comes thereby under their
territorial supremacy, they have an opportunity of
inflicting punishment. The question is, therefore,
whether States have a right to jurisdiction over acts of
foreigners committed in foreign countries, and whether
the home State of such an alien has a duty to acquiesce
in the latter's punishment in case he comes into
the power of these States. The question must be answered
in the negative. For at the time such criminal
acts are committed the perpetrators are neither under
the territorial nor under the personal supremacy of the
States concerned. And a State can only require respect
for its laws from such aliens as are permanently or
transiently within its territory. No right for a State
to extend its jurisdiction over acts of foreigners committed
in foreign countries can be said to have grown
up according to the Law of Nations, and the right of
protection over citizens abroad held by every State
would justify it in an intervention in case one of its
citizens abroad should be required to stand his trial
before the Courts of another State for criminal acts
which he did not commit during the time he was under
the territorial supremacy of such State.<a id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_242_242">[242]</a> In the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>

Cutting—an intervention took place according to this
view. In 1886, one A. K. Cutting, a subject of the United
States, was arrested in Mexico for an alleged libel against
one Emigdio Medina, a subject of Mexico, which was
published in the newspaper of El Paso in Texas. Mexico
maintained that she had a right to punish Cutting,
because according to her Criminal Law offences committed
by foreigners abroad against Mexican subjects
are punishable in Mexico. The United States, however,
intervened,<a id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_244_244">[244]</a> and demanded Cutting's release. Mexico
refused to comply with this demand, but nevertheless
Cutting was finally released, as the plaintiff withdrew his
action for libel. Since Mexico likewise refused to comply
with the demand of the United States to alter her
Criminal Law for the purpose of avoiding in the future
a similar incident, diplomatic practice has not at all
settled the subject.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Nature of
State
Responsibility.</p></div>
<p>§ 148. <a id="It_is_often_maintained148"></a>It is often maintained that a State, as a
sovereign person, can have no legal responsibility
whatever. This is only correct with reference to certain
acts of a State towards its subjects. Since a State
can abolish parts of its Municipal Law and can make
new Municipal Law, it can always avoid legal, although
not moral, responsibility by a change of Municipal Law.
Different from this internal autocracy is the external
responsibility of a State to fulfil its international legal
duties. Responsibility for such duties is, as will be remembered,<a id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_245_245">[245]</a>
a quality of every State as an International
Person, without which the Family of Nations could not
peaceably exist. Although there is no International<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
Court of Justice which could establish such responsibility
and pronounce a fine or other punishment against
a State for neglect of its international duties, State
responsibility concerning international duties is nevertheless
a <i>legal</i> responsibility. For a State cannot
abolish or create new International Law in the same
way as it can abolish or create new Municipal Law. A
State, therefore, cannot renounce its international duties
unilaterally<a id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_246_246">[246]</a> at discretion, but is and remains legally
bound by them. And although there is not and never
will be a central authority above the single States to
enforce the fulfilment of these duties, there is the legalised
self-help of the single States against one another.
For every neglect of an international legal duty constitutes
an international delinquency,<a id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_247_247">[247]</a> and the violated
State can through reprisals or even war compel the
delinquent State to comply with its international duties.
It is only theorists who deny the possibility of a legal
responsibility of States, the practice of the States
themselves recognises it distinctly, although there may
in a special case be controversy as to whether a responsibility
is to be borne. And State responsibility
is now in a general way recognised for the time of war
by article 3 of the Hague Convention of 1907, concerning
the Laws and Customs of War on Land, which
stipulates: "A belligerent party which violates the
provisions of the said Regulations shall, if the case
demands, be liable to make compensation. It shall be
responsible for all acts committed by persons forming
part of its armed forces."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Original and Vicarious State Responsibility.</p></div>
<p>§ 149. <a id="No149"></a>Now if we examine the various international
duties out of which responsibility of a State may rise,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
we find that there is a necessity for two different kinds
of State responsibility to be distinguished. They may
be named "original" in contradistinction to "vicarious"
responsibility. I name as "original" the responsibility
borne by a State for its own—that is, its
Government's actions, and for such actions of the lower
agents or private individuals as are performed at the
Government's command or with its authorisation. But
States have to bear another responsibility besides that
just mentioned. For States are, according to the Law
of Nations, in a sense responsible for certain acts other
than their own—namely, certain unauthorised injurious
acts of their agents, of their subjects, and even of such
aliens as are for the time living within their territory.
This responsibility of States for acts other than
their own I name "vicarious" responsibility. Since the
Law of Nations is a law between States only, and since
States are the sole exclusive subjects of International
Law, individuals are mere objects<a id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_248_248">[248]</a> of International Law,
and the latter is unable to confer directly rights and
duties upon individuals. And for this reason the Law
of Nations must make every State in a sense responsible
for certain internationally injurious acts committed by
its officials, subjects, and such aliens as are temporarily
resident on its territory.<a id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_249_249">[249]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_248_248"></a><a href="#FNanchor_248_248" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[248]</span></a> See

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_249_249"></a><a href="#FNanchor_249_249" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[249]</span></a> The distinction between original and vicarious
responsibility was first made, in 1905, in the first edition of this
treatise and ought therefore to have been discussed by Anzillotti in his
able article in R.G. XIII. (1906), p. 292. The fact that he does not
appreciate this distinction is prejudicial to the results of his
researches concerning the responsibility of States.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Essential Difference between Original and Vicarious
Responsibility.</p></div>
<p>§ 150. <a id="It150"></a>It is, however, obvious that original and
vicarious State responsibility are essentially different.
Whereas the one is responsibility of a State for a neglect
of its own duty, the other is not. A neglect of international
legal duties by a State constitutes an international
delinquency. The responsibility which a State
bears for such delinquency is especially grave, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
requires, apart from other especial consequences, a
formal expiatory act, such as an apology at least, by
the delinquent State to repair the wrong done. On
the other hand, the vicarious responsibility which a
State bears requires chiefly compulsion to make those
officials or other individuals who have committed internationally
injurious acts repair as far as possible the
wrong done, and punishment, if necessary, of the wrongdoers.
In case a State complies with these requirements,
no blame falls upon it on account of such injurious acts.
But of course, in case a State refuses to comply with
these requirements, it commits thereby an international
delinquency, and its hitherto vicarious responsibility
turns <i>ipso facto</i> into original responsibility.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Conception
of
International
Delinquencies.</p></div>
<p>§ 151. <a id="International_delinquency151"></a>International delinquency is every injury to
another State committed by the head and the Government
of a State through violation of an international
legal duty. Equivalent to acts of the head and Government
are acts of officials or other individuals commanded
or authorised by the head or Government.</p>
<p>An international delinquency is not a crime, because
the delinquent State, as a Sovereign, cannot be punished,
although compulsion may be exercised to procure
a reparation of the wrong done.</p>
<p>International delinquencies in the technical sense of
the term must not be confounded either with so-called
"Crimes against the Law of Nations" or with so-called
"International Crimes." "Crimes against the Law of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
Nations" in the wording of many Criminal Codes of
the single States are such acts of individuals against
foreign States as are rendered criminal by these Codes.
Of these acts, the gravest are those for which the State
on whose territory they are committed bears a vicarious
responsibility according to the Law of Nations. "International
Crimes," on the other hand, refer to crimes like
piracy on the high seas or slave trade, which either every
State can punish on seizure of the criminals, of whatever
nationality they may be, or which every State has by
the Law of Nations a duty to prevent.</p>
<p>An international delinquency must, further, not be
confounded with discourteous and unfriendly acts.
Although such acts may be met by retorsion, they are
not illegal and therefore not delinquent acts.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Subjects of International Delinquencies.</p></div>
<p>§ 152. An international delinquency may be committed
by every member of the Family of Nations, be
such member a full-Sovereign, half-Sovereign, or part-Sovereign
State. Yet, half- and part-Sovereign States
can commit international delinquencies in so far only
as they have a footing within the Family of Nations,
and therefore international duties of their own. And
even then the circumstances of each case decide whether
the delinquent has to account for its neglect of an international
duty directly to the wronged State, or whether
it is the full-Sovereign State (suzerain, federal, or protectorate-exercising
State) to which the delinquent
State is attached that must bear a vicarious responsibility
for the delinquency. On the other hand, so-called
Colonial States without any footing whatever within the
Family of Nations and, further, the member-States of
the American Federal States, which likewise lack any
footing whatever within the Family of Nations because
all their possible international relations are absorbed
by the respective Federal States, cannot commit an
international delinquency. Thus an injurious act against<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
France committed by the Government of the Commonwealth
of Australia or by the Government of the State
of California in the United States of America, would not
be an international delinquency in the technical sense
of the term, but merely an internationally injurious act
for which Great Britain or the United States of America
must bear a vicarious responsibility. An instance of
this is to be found in the conflict<a id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_250_250">[250]</a> which arose in 1906
between Japan and the United States of America on
account of the segregation of Japanese children by the
Board of Education of San Francisco and the demand
of Japan that this measure should be withdrawn. The
Government of the United States at once took the side
of Japan, and endeavoured to induce California to comply
with the Japanese demands.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>State Organs able to commit International Delinquencies.</p></div>
<p>§ 153. Since States are juristic persons, the question
arises, Whose internationally injurious acts are to be
considered State acts and therefore international delinquencies?
It is obvious that acts of this kind are,
first, all such acts as are performed by the heads of
States or by the members of Government acting in
that capacity, so that their acts appear as State acts.
Acts of such kind are, secondly, all acts of officials or
other individuals which are either commanded or
authorised by Governments. On the other hand, unauthorised
acts of corporations, such as Municipalities,
or of officials, such as magistrates or even ambassadors,
or of private individuals, never constitute an international
delinquency. And, further, all acts committed
by heads of States and members of Government outside
their official capacity, simply as individuals who act for
themselves and not for the State, are not international
delinquencies either.<a id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_251_251">[251]</a> The States concerned must certainly
bear a vicarious responsibility for all such acts,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
but for that very reason these acts do not comprise
international delinquencies.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_251_251"></a><a href="#FNanchor_251_251" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[251]</span></a> See
 below, §§ <a href="#Page_157" class="pginternal">157</a>-158.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>No International Delinquency without Malice or culpable
Negligence.</p></div>
<p>§ 154. <a id="An154"></a>An act of a State injurious to another State
is nevertheless not an international delinquency if committed
neither wilfully and maliciously nor with culpable
negligence. Therefore, an act of a State committed
by right or prompted by self-preservation in necessary
self-defence does not contain an international delinquency,
however injurious it may actually be to another
State. And the same is valid in regard to acts of
officials or other individuals committed by command or
with the authorisation of a Government.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Objects of International Delinquencies.</p></div>
<p>§ 155. <a id="International_delinquencies155"></a>International delinquencies may be committed
against so many different objects that it is impossible
to enumerate them. It suffices to give some
striking examples. Thus a State may be injured—in
regard to its independence through an unjustified intervention;
in regard to its territorial supremacy through
a violation of its frontier; in regard to its dignity
through disrespectful treatment of its head or its diplomatic
envoys; in regard to its personal supremacy
through forcible naturalisation of its citizens abroad;
in regard to its treaty rights through an act violating a
treaty; in regard to its right of protection over citizens
abroad through any act that violates the body, the
honour, or the property<a id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_252_252">[252]</a> of one of its citizens abroad.
A State may also suffer various injuries in time of war
by illegitimate acts of warfare, or by a violation of
neutrality on the part of a neutral State in favour of
the other belligerent. And a neutral may in time of
war be injured in various ways through a belligerent
violating neutrality by acts of warfare within the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
neutral State's territory; for instance, through a belligerent
man-of-war attacking an enemy vessel in a
neutral port or in neutral territorial waters, or through
a belligerent violating neutrality by acts of warfare
committed on the Open Sea against neutral vessels.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_252_252"></a><a href="#FNanchor_252_252" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[252]</span></a> That a State which does not pay its public debts due to
foreigners and refuses, on the demand of the home State of the
foreigners concerned, to make satisfactory arrangements commits
international delinquency there is no doubt. On the so-called Drago
doctrine and the Hague Convention concerning the Employment of Force for
the Recovery of Contract Debts, see
 above, § <a href="#The_right_of_pro6of135" class="pginternal">135, No. 6</a>.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Legal consequences of International Delinquencies.</p></div>
<p>§ 156. <a id="Th156"></a>The nature of the Law of Nations as a law
between, not above, Sovereign States excludes the
possibility of punishing a State for an international
delinquency and of considering the latter in the light
of a crime. The only legal consequences of an international
delinquency that are possible under existing
circumstances are such as create a reparation of the
moral and material wrong done. The merits and the
conditions of the special cases are, however, so different
that it is impossible for the Law of Nations to prescribe
once for all what legal consequences an international
delinquency should have. The only rule which is
unanimously recognised by theory and practice is that
out of an international delinquency arises a right for
the wronged State to request from the delinquent State
the performance of such expiatory acts as are necessary
for a reparation of the wrong done. What kind of acts
these are depends upon the special case and the discretion
of the wronged State. It is obvious that there
must be a pecuniary reparation for a material damage.
Thus, according to article 3 of the Hague Convention
of 1907, concerning the Laws and Customs of War on
Land, a belligerent party which violates these laws shall,
if the case demands, be liable to make compensation.
But at least a formal apology on the part of the delinquent
will in every case be necessary. This apology may
have to take the form of some ceremonial act, such as
a salute to the flag or to the coat of arms of the wronged
State, the mission of a special embassy bearing apologies,
and the like. A great difference would naturally
be made between acts of reparation for international<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
delinquencies deliberately and maliciously committed,
on the one hand, and, on the other, for such as arise
merely from culpable negligence.</p>
<p>When the delinquent State refuses reparation of the
wrong done, the wronged State can exercise such means
as are necessary to enforce an adequate reparation.
In case of international delinquencies committed in
time of peace, such means are reprisals<a id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_253_253">[253]</a> (including
embargo and pacific blockade) and war as the case may
require. On the other hand, in case of international
delinquencies committed in time of war through illegitimate
acts of warfare on the part of a belligerent,
such means are reprisals and the taking of hostages.<a id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_254_254">[254]</a></p>

</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Responsibility varies with Organs concerned.</p></div>
<p>§ 157. States must bear vicarious responsibility for
all internationally injurious acts of their organs. As,
however, these organs are of different kinds and of
different position, the actual responsibility of a State
for acts of its organs varies with the agents concerned.
It is therefore necessary to distinguish between internationally
injurious acts of heads of States, members
of Government, diplomatic envoys, parliaments, judicial
functionaries, administrative officials, and military
and naval forces.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Internationally injurious Acts of Heads of States.</p></div>
<p>§ 158. Such international injurious acts as are committed
by heads of States in the exercise of their official
functions are not our concern here, because they constitute
international delinquencies which have been
discussed above (§§ <a href="#International_delinquency151" class="pginternal">151</a>-156). But a monarch can, just<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
as any other individual, in his private life commit many
internationally injurious acts, and the question is,
whether and in what degree a State must bear responsibility
for such acts of its head. The position of a
head of a State, who is within and without his State
neither under the jurisdiction of a Court of Justice nor
under any kind of disciplinary control, makes it a necessity
for the Law of Nations to claim a certain vicarious
responsibility from States for internationally injurious
acts committed by their heads in private life. Thus,
for instance, when a monarch during his stay abroad
commits an act injurious to the property of a foreign
subject and refuses adequate reparation, his State may
be requested to pay damages on his behalf.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Internationally injurious Acts of Members of Government.</p></div>
<p>§ 159. As regards internationally injurious acts of
members of a Government, a distinction must be made
between such acts as are committed by the offenders in
their official capacity, and other acts. Acts of the first
kind constitute international delinquencies, as stated
above (§ 153). But members of a Government can in
their private life perform as many internationally injurious
acts as private individuals, and we must ascertain
therefore what kind of responsibility their State
must bear for such acts. Now, as members of a Government
have not the exceptional position of heads of
States, and are, therefore, under the jurisdiction of the
ordinary Courts of Justice, there is no reason why their
State should bear for internationally injurious acts
committed by them in their private life a vicarious
responsibility different from that which it has to bear
for acts of private persons.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Internationally injurious Acts of Diplomatic Envoys.</p></div>
<p>§ 160. The position of diplomatic envoys who, as
representatives of their home State, enjoy the privileges
of exterritoriality, gives, on the one hand, a very
great importance to internationally injurious acts committed
by them on the territory of the receiving State,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
and, on the other hand, excludes the jurisdiction of
the receiving State over such acts. The Law of Nations
therefore makes the home State in a sense responsible
for all acts of an envoy injurious to the State or its
subjects in whose territory he resides. But it depends
upon the merits of the special case what measures
beyond simple recall must be taken to satisfy the
wronged State. Thus, for instance, a crime committed
by the envoy on the territory of the receiving State
must be punished by his home State, and according to
special circumstances and conditions the home State
may be obliged to disown an act of its envoy, to apologise
or express its regret for his behaviour, or to pay
damages. It must, however, be remembered that such
injurious acts as an envoy performs at the command
or with the authorisation of the home State, constitute
international delinquencies for which the home State
bears original responsibility and for which the envoy
cannot personally be blamed.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Internationally injurious Attitudes of Parliaments.</p></div>
<p>§ 161. As regards internationally injurious attitudes
of parliaments, it must be kept in mind that, most
important as may be the part parliaments play in the
political life of a nation, they do not belong to the
agents which represent the States in their international
relations with other States. Therefore, however injurious
to a foreign State an attitude of a parliament
may be, it can never constitute an international delinquency.
That, on the other hand, all States must bear
vicarious responsibility for such attitudes of their parliaments,
there can be no doubt. But, although the
position of a Government is difficult in such cases,
especially in States that have a representative Government,
this does not concern the wronged State, which
has a right to demand satisfaction and reparation for
the wrong done.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Internationally injurious Acts of Judicial Functionaries.</p></div>
<p>§ 162. Internationally injurious acts committed by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
judicial functionaries in their private life are in no way
different from such acts committed by other individuals.
But these functionaries may in their official capacity
commit such acts, and the question is how far a State's
vicarious responsibility for acts of its judicial functionaries
can reasonably be extended in face of the fact that
in modern civilised States these functionaries are to a
great extent independent of their Government.<a id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_255_255">[255]</a> Undoubtedly,
in case of such denial or undue delay of
justice by the Courts as is internationally injurious, a
State must find means to exercise compulsion against
such Courts. And the same is valid with regard to an
obvious and malicious act of misapplication of the law
by the Courts which is injurious to another State. But
if a Court observes its own proper forms of justice and
nevertheless makes a materially unjust order or pronounces
a materially unjust judgment, matters become
so complicated that there is hardly a peaceable way in
which the injured State can successfully obtain reparation
for the wrong done, unless the other party consents
to bring the case before a Court of Arbitration.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_255_255"></a><a href="#FNanchor_255_255" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[255]</span></a> Wharton, II. § 230, comprises abundant and instructive
material on this question.</p></div>
<p>An illustrative case is that of the <i>Costa Rica Packet</i>,<a id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_256_256">[256]</a>
which happened in 1891. Carpenter, the master of
this Australian whaling-ship, was, by order of a Court
of Justice, arrested on November 2, 1891, in the port
of Ternate, in the Dutch East Indies, for having committed
three years previously a theft on the sea within
Dutch territorial waters. He was, however, released
on November 28, because the Court found that the
alleged crime was not committed within Dutch territorial
waters, but on the High Seas. Great Britain
demanded damages for the arrest of the master of
the <i>Costa Rica Packet</i>, but Holland maintained that,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
since the judicial authorities concerned had ordered
the arrest of Carpenter in strict conformity with
the Dutch laws, the British claim was unjustified.
After some correspondence, extending over several
years, Great Britain and Holland agreed, in 1895, upon
having the conflict settled by arbitration and upon
appointing the late Professor de Martens of St. Petersburg
as arbitrator. The award, given in 1899, was in
favour of Great Britain, and Holland was condemned to
pay damages to the master, the proprietors, and the
crew of the <i>Costa Rica Packet</i>.<a id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_257_257">[257]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Internationally injurious Acts of administrative Officials
and Military and Naval Forces.</p></div>
<p>§ 163. <a id="In163"></a>Internationally injurious acts committed in
the exercise of their official functions by administrative
officials and military and naval forces of a State without
that State's command or authorisation, are not
international delinquencies because they are not State
acts. But a State bears a wide, unlimited, and unrestricted
vicarious responsibility for such acts because
its administrative officials and military and naval forces
are under its disciplinary control, and because all acts
of such officials and forces in the exercise of their official
functions are <i>prima facie</i> acts of the respective State.<a id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_258_258">[258]</a>
Therefore, a State has, first of all, to disown and disapprove
of such acts by expressing its regret or even
apologising to the Government of the injured State;
secondly, damages must be paid where required; and,
lastly, the offenders must be punished according to the
merits of the special case.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_258_258"></a><a href="#FNanchor_258_258" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[258]</span></a> It is of importance to quote again here art. 3 of the Hague
Convention of 1907, concerning the Laws and Customs of War on Land,
which stipulates that a State is responsible for all acts committed by
its armed forces.</p></div>
<p>As regards the question what kind of acts of administrative
officials and military and naval forces are
of an internationally injurious character, the rule may
safely be laid down that such acts of these subjects are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
internationally injurious as would constitute international
delinquencies when committed by the State
itself or with its authorisation. Three very instructive
cases may be quoted as illustrative examples:</p>
<p>(1) On September 26, 1887, a German soldier on
sentry duty at the frontier near Vexaincourt shot from
the German side and killed an individual who was on
French territory. As this act of the sentry violated
French territorial supremacy, Germany disowned and
apologised for it and paid a sum of 50,000 francs to
the widow of the deceased as damages. The sentry,
however, escaped punishment because he proved that
he had acted in obedience to orders which he had misunderstood.</p>
<p>(2) On November 26, 1906, Hasmann, a member
of the crew of the German gunboat <i>Panther</i>,<a id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_259_259">[259]</a> at
that time in the port of Itajahi in Brazil, failed to
return on board his ship. The commander of the
<i>Panther</i> sent a searching party, comprising three
officers in plain clothes and a dozen non-commissioned
officers and soldiers in uniform, on shore for the purpose
of finding the whereabouts of Hasmann. This party,
during the following night, penetrated into several
houses, and compelled some of the residents to assist
them in their search for the missing Hasmann, who,
however, could not be found. He voluntarily returned
on board the following morning. As this act violated
Brazilian territorial supremacy, Brazil lodged a complaint
with Germany, which, after an inquiry, disowned
the act of the commander of the <i>Panther</i>, formally
apologised for it, and punished the commander of the
<i>Panther</i> by relieving him of his command.<a id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_260_260">[260]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_260_260"></a><a href="#FNanchor_260_260" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[260]</span></a> Another example occurred in 1904, when the Russian Baltic
Fleet, on its way to the Far East during the Russo-Japanese war, fired
upon the Hull Fishing Fleet off the Dogger Bank; see

<p>(3) On July 15, 1911, while the Spanish were in occupation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
of Alcazar in Morocco, M. Boisset, the French
Consular Agent, who was riding back to Alcazar from
Suk el Arba with his native servants, was stopped at
the gate of the town by a Spanish sentinel. The sentinel
refused to allow him to enter unless he and his
servants first delivered up their arms. As M. Boisset
refused, the sentinel barred the way with his fixed
bayonet and called out the guard. M. Boisset's horse
reared, and the sentinel thereupon covered him with
his rifle. After parleying to no purpose with the guard,
to whom he explained who he was, the French Consular
Agent was conducted by an armed escort of Spanish
soldiers to the Spanish barracks. A native rabble followed
upon the heels of the procession and cried out:
"The French Consular Agent is being arrested by the
Spaniards." Upon arriving at the barracks M. Boisset
had an interview with a Spanish officer, who, without
in any way expressing regret, merely observed that
there had been a misunderstanding (<i>equivocacione</i>), and
allowed the French Consular Agent to go his way. It
is obvious that, as Consuls in Eastern non-Christian
countries, Japan now excepted, are exterritorial and
inviolable, the arrest of M. Boisset was a great injury
to France, which lodged a complaint with Spain. As
promptly as July 19 the Spanish Government tendered
a formal apology to France, and instructed the Spanish
Commander at Alcazar to tender a formal apology to
M. Boisset.</p>
<p>But it must be specially emphasised that a State
never bears any responsibility for losses sustained by
foreign subjects through <i>legitimate</i> acts of administrative
officials and military and naval forces. Individuals
who enter foreign territory submit themselves
to the law of the land, and their home State has no
right to request that they should be otherwise treated
than as the law of the land authorises a State to treat<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
its own subjects.<a id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_261_261">[261]</a> Therefore, since the Law of Nations
does not prevent a State from expelling aliens, the
home State of an expelled alien cannot request the
expelling State to pay damages for the losses sustained
by the expelled through his having to leave the country.
Therefore, further, a State need not make any reparation
for losses sustained by an alien through legitimate
measures taken by administrative officials and
military forces in time of war, insurrection,<a id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_262_262">[262]</a> riot, or
public calamity, such as a fire, an epidemic outbreak of
dangerous disease, and the like.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_261_261"></a><a href="#FNanchor_261_261" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[261]</span></a> Provided, however, such law does not violate essential

<h4>
<span class="larger">IV</span>
<span class="smaller">STATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ACTS OF PRIVATE PERSONS</span>
</h4>
<p class="indh1">See the literature quoted above at the commencement of § <a href="#It_is_often_maintained148" class="pginternal">148</a>, and
especially Moore, VI. §§ 1019-1031.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Vicarious in contradistinction to original State
Responsibility for Acts of Private Persons.</p></div>
<p>§ 164. As regards State responsibility for acts of
private persons, it is first of all necessary not to confound
the original with the vicarious responsibility of
States for internationally injurious acts of private
persons. International Law imposes the duty upon
every State to prevent as far as possible its own subjects,
and such foreign subjects as live within its territory,
from committing injurious acts against other States.
A State which either intentionally and maliciously or
through culpable negligence does not comply with this
duty commits an international delinquency for which
it has to bear original responsibility. But it is practically
impossible for a State to prevent all injurious acts
which a private person might commit against a foreign
State. It is for that reason that a State must, according
to International Law, bear vicarious responsibility<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
for such injurious acts of private individuals as are
incapable of prevention.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Vicarious responsibility for Acts of Private Persons relative
only.</p></div>
<p>§ 165. Now, whereas the vicarious responsibility of
States for official acts of administrative officials and
military and naval forces is unlimited and unrestricted,
their vicarious responsibility for acts of private persons
is only relative. For their sole duty is to procure satisfaction
and reparation for the wronged State as far as
possible by punishing the offenders and compelling
them to pay damages where required. Beyond this
limit a State is not responsible for acts of private persons;
there is in especial no duty of a State itself to
pay damages for such acts if the offenders are not able
to do it.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Municipal Law for Offences against Foreign States.</p></div>
<p>§ 166. It is a consequence of the vicarious responsibility
of States for acts of private persons that by the
Criminal Law of every civilised State punishment is
severe for certain offences of private persons against
foreign States, such as violation of ambassadors' privileges,
libel on heads of foreign States and on foreign
envoys, and other injurious acts.<a id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_263_263">[263]</a> In every case that
arises the offender must be prosecuted and the law
enforced by the Courts of Justice. And it is further a
consequence of the vicarious responsibility of States
for acts of private persons that criminal offences of
private persons against foreign subjects—such offences
are indirectly offences against the respective foreign
States because the latter exercise protection over their
subjects abroad—must be punished according to the
ordinary law of the land, and that the Civil Courts of
Justice of the land must be accessible for claims of
foreign subjects against individuals living under the
territorial supremacy of such land.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_263_263"></a><a href="#FNanchor_263_263" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[263]</span></a> As regards the Criminal Law of England concerning such
acts, see Stephen's Digest, articles 96-103.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Responsibility for Acts of Insurgents and Rioters.</p></div>
<p>§ 167. <a id="Th167"></a>The vicarious responsibility of States for acts
of insurgents and rioters is the same as for acts of other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
private individuals. As soon as peace and order are
re-established, such insurgents and rioters as have committed
criminal injuries against foreign States must be
punished according to the law of the land. The point
need not be mentioned at all were it not for the fact
that, in several cases of insurrection and riots, claims
have been made by foreign States against the local State
for damages for losses sustained by their subjects through
acts of the insurgents or rioters respectively, and that
some writers<a id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_264_264">[264]</a> assert that such claims are justified by
the Law of Nations. The majority of writers maintain,
correctly, I think, that the responsibility of States
does not involve the duty to repair the losses which
foreign subjects have sustained through acts of insurgents
and rioters. Individuals who enter foreign territory
must take the risk of an outbreak of insurrections
or riots just as the risk of the outbreak of other calamities.
When they sustain a loss from acts of insurgents
or rioters, they may, if they can, trace their losses
to the acts of certain individuals, and claim damages
from the latter before the Courts of Justice. The responsibility
of a State for acts of private persons injurious
to foreign subjects reaches only so far that its Courts
must be accessible to the latter for the purpose of claiming
damages from the offenders, and must punish such
of those acts as are criminal. And in States which, as
France for instance, have such Municipal Laws as make
the town or the county where an insurrection or riot has
taken place responsible for the pecuniary loss sustained
by individuals during those events, foreign subjects must
be allowed to claim damages from the local authorities
for losses of such kind. But the State itself never has
by International Law a duty to pay such damages.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_264_264"></a><a href="#FNanchor_264_264" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[264]</span></a> See,
 for instance, Rivier, II. p. 43; Brusa in Annuaire
XVII. pp. 96-137; Bar in R.I. 2nd Ser. I. (1899), pp. 464-481.</p></div>
<p>The practice of the States agrees with this rule laid
down by the majority of writers. Although in some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
cases several States have paid damages for losses of
such kind, they have done it, not through compulsion
of law, but for political reasons. In most cases in which
the damages have been claimed for such losses, the
respective States have refused to comply with the
request.<a id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_265_265">[265]</a> As such claims have during the second half
of the nineteenth century frequently been tendered
against American States which have repeatedly been
the scene of insurrections, several of these States have
in commercial and similar treaties which they concluded
with other States expressly stipulated<a id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_266_266">[266]</a> that they are
not responsible for losses sustained by foreign subjects
on their territory through acts of insurgents and rioters.</p>

<p>The Institute of International Law has studied the
matter and has proposed<a id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_267_267">[267]</a> the following <i>Règlement</i> concerning
it:—</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_267_267"></a><a href="#FNanchor_267_267" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[267]</span></a> At its meeting at Neuchâtel in 1900; see
 Annuaire, XVIII.
p. 254.</p></div>
<p class="blockquot">(1) Independently of the case in which indemnities are due
to foreigners by virtue of the general laws of the country, foreigners
have a right to compensation when they are injured as
to their person or as to their property in the course of a riot, of
an insurrection, or of a civil war:</p>
<p class="blockquot">(<i>a</i>) When the act from which they have suffered is directed
against foreigners as such in general, or against them as under
the jurisdiction of a certain State, or</p>
<p class="blockquot">(<i>b</i>) When the act from which they have suffered consists
in closing a port without due and proper previous notification,
or in retaining foreign ships in a port, or</p>
<p class="blockquot">(<i>c</i>) When the injury is the result of an act contrary to the
laws committed by a government official, or</p>
<p class="blockquot">(<i>d</i>) When the obligation to compensate is established by
virtue of the general principles of the law of war.</p>
<p class="blockquot">(2) The obligation is equally well established when the injury
has been committed (No. 1, <i>a</i> and <i>d</i>) on the territory of an insurrectionary
government, whether by this government itself,
or by one of its functionaries.</p>
<p class="blockquot">On the other hand, certain demands for indemnity may be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
set aside when they concern facts which occur after the government
of the State to which the injured person belongs has recognised
the insurrectionary government as a belligerent Power,
and when the injured person has continued to keep his domicile
or his habitation on the territory of the insurrectionary government.</p>
<p class="blockquot">As long as the latter is considered by the government of the
person alleged to be injured as a belligerent Power, the demand
may only be addressed, in the case of paragraph 1 of article 2,
to the insurrectionary government and not to the legitimate
government.</p>
<p class="blockquot">(3) The obligation to compensate disappears when the injured
persons are themselves a cause of the event which has brought
the injury.<a id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_268_268">[268]</a> Notably no obligation exists to indemnify those
who have returned to the country or who wish to give themselves
up to commerce or industry there, when they know, or ought
to know, that troubles have broken out, nor to indemnify those
who establish themselves or sojourn in a country which offers
no security on account of the presence of savage tribes, unless
the government of the country has given express assurance to
immigrants.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_268_268"></a><a href="#FNanchor_268_268" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[268]</span></a> For example, in the case of
conduct which is particularly provocative
to a crowd.</p></div>
<p class="blockquot">(4) The government of a Federal State composed of a certain
number of smaller States, which it represents from an international
point of view, may not plead, in order to avoid the
responsibility which falls upon it, the fact that the constitution
of the Federal State does not give it the right to control the
member-States, nor the right to exact from them the discharge
of their obligations.</p>
<p class="blockquot">(5) The stipulations mutually exempting States from the
duty of giving their diplomatic protection ought not to comprise
the cases of refusal of justice, or of evident violation of justice or
of International Law.<a id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_269_269">[269]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_269_269"></a><a href="#FNanchor_269_269" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[269]</span></a> The Institute of International Law has likewise—see
 Annuaire, XVIII. pp. 253 and 256—expressed the two following
<i>vœux</i>:—</p>
<p class="blockquot">(<i>a</i>) The Institute of International Law expresses the wish that the
States should avoid inserting in treaties clauses of reciprocal
irresponsibility. It considers that these clauses are wrong in exempting
States from the fulfilment of their duty of protecting their nationals
abroad and of their duty of protecting foreigners on their territory. It
considers that the States which, on account of extraordinary
circumstances, do not feel themselves at all in a position to assure
protection in a sufficiently efficacious manner to foreigners on their
territory, can only avoid the consequences of this condition of things
by temporarily prohibiting foreigners to enter their territory.
</p>
<p class="blockquot">(<i>b</i>) Recourse to international commissions of inquiry and to
international tribunals is in general recommended for all differences
which may arise on account of injury to foreigners in the course of a
riot, an insurrection, or of civil war.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Conception of State Territory.</p></div>
<p>§ 168. <a id="State_territory_is_that168"></a>State territory is that definite portion of the
surface of the globe which is subjected to the sovereignty
of the State. A State without a territory is
not possible, although the necessary territory may be
very small, as in the case of the Free Town of Hamburg,
the Principality of Monaco, the Republic of San
Marino, or the Principality of Lichtenstein. A wandering
tribe, although it has a Government and is otherwise
organised, is not a State before it has settled down
on a territory of its own.</p>
<p>State territory is also named territorial property of
a State. Yet it must be borne in mind that territorial
property is a term of Public Law and must not be confounded
with private property. The territory of a
State is not the property of the monarch, or of the
Government, or even of the people of a State; it is
the country which is subjected to the territorial supremacy
or the <i>imperium</i> of a State. This distinction has,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
however, in former centuries not been sharply drawn.<a id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_270_270">[270]</a>
In spite of the <i>dictum</i> of Seneca, "Omnia rex imperio
possidet, singuli dominio," the <i>imperium</i> of the monarch
and the State over the State territory has very
often been identified with private property of the
monarch or the State. But with the disappearance of
absolutism this identification has likewise disappeared.
It is for this reason that nowadays, according to the
Constitutional Law of most countries, neither the monarch
nor the Government is able to dispose of parts of
the State territory at will and without the consent of
Parliament.<a id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_271_271">[271]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_270_270"></a><a href="#FNanchor_270_270" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[270]</span></a> And some writers refuse to draw it even nowadays, as, for
instance, Lawrence, § 71.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_271_271"></a><a href="#FNanchor_271_271" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[271]</span></a> In English Constitutional Law this point is not settled.
The cession of the Island of Heligoland to Germany in 1890 was, however,
made conditional on the approval of Parliament.</p></div>
<p>It must, further, be emphasised that the territory
of a State is totally independent of the racial character
of the inhabitants of the State. The territory is the
public property of the State, and not of a nation in the
sense of a race. The State community may consist of
different nations, as, for instance, the British or the Swiss
or the Austrians.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Different kinds of Territory.</p></div>
<p>§ 169. <a id="Th169"></a>The territory of a State may consist of one
piece of the surface of the globe only, such as that of
Switzerland. Such kind of territory is named "integrate
territory" (<i>territorium clausum</i>). But the territory
of a State may also be dismembered and consist
of several pieces, such as that of Great Britain. All
States with colonies have a "dismembered territory."</p>
<p>If a territory or a piece of it is absolutely surrounded
by the territory of another State, it is named an "enclosure."
Thus the Republic of San Marino is an
enclosure of Italy, and Birkenfeld, a piece of the territory
of the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg situated on the
river Rhine, is an enclosure of Prussia.</p>
<p>Another distinction is that between motherland and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
colonies. Colonies rank as territory of the motherland,
although they may enjoy complete self-government and
therefore be called Colonial States. Thus, if viewed
from the standpoint of the Law of Nations, the Dominion
of Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia,
New Zealand, and the Union of South Africa are British
territory.</p>
<p>As regards the relation between the Suzerain and
the Vassal State, it is certain that the vassal is not, in
the strict sense of the term, a part of the territory of
the suzerain. Crete and Egypt are not Turkish territory,
although under Turkish suzerainty. But no
general rule can be laid down, as everything depends on
the merits of the special case, and as the vassal, even if
it has some footing of its own within the Family of
Nations, is internationally for the most part considered
a mere portion of the Suzerain State.<a id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_272_272">[272]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_272_272"></a><a href="#FNanchor_272_272" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[272]</span></a> See
 above, § <a href="#Th91" class="pginternal">91</a>.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Importance of State Territory.</p></div>
<p>§ 170. The importance of State territory lies in the
fact that it is the space within which the State exercises
its supreme authority. State territory is an object
of the Law of Nations because the latter recognises the
supreme authority of every State within its territory.
Whatever person or thing is on or enters into that territory,
is <i>ipso facto</i> subjected to the supreme authority
of the respective State according to the old rules, <i>Quidquid
est in territorio, est etiam de territorio</i> and <i>Qui in
territorio meo est, etiam meus subditus est</i>. No foreign
authority has any power within the boundaries of the
home territory, although foreign Sovereigns and diplomatic
envoys enjoy the so-called privilege of exterritoriality,
and although the Law of Nations does, and
international treaties may, restrict<a id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_273_273">[273]</a> the home authority
in many points in the exercise of its sovereignty.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_273_273"></a><a href="#FNanchor_273_273" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[273]</span></a> See
 above, §§ <a href="#Independence_is_not126" class="pginternal">126</a>-128.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>One Territory, one State.</p></div>
<p>§ 171. <a id="Th171"></a>The supreme authority which a State exercises
over its territory makes it apparent that on one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
and the same territory can exist one full-Sovereign
State only. Two or more full-Sovereign States on one
and the same territory are an impossibility. The following
five cases, of which the Law of Nations is
cognisant, are apparent, but not real, exceptions to
this rule.</p>
<p>(1) There is, first, the case of the so-called <i>condominium</i>.
It happens sometimes that a piece of territory
consisting of land or water is under the joint
<i>tenancy</i> of two or more States, these several States
exercising sovereignty conjointly over such piece and
the individuals living thereon. Thus Schleswig-Holstein
and Lauenburg from 1864 till 1866 were under the
<i>condominium</i> of Austria and Prussia. Thus, further,
Moresnet (Kelmis), on the frontier of Belgium and
Prussia, is under the <i>condominium</i> of these two States<a id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_274_274">[274]</a>
because they have not yet come to an agreement regarding
the interpretation of a boundary treaty of 1815
between the Netherlands and Prussia. And since 1898
the Soudan is under the <i>condominium</i> of Great Britain
and Egypt. It is easy to show that in such cases<a id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_275_275">[275]</a>
there are not two States on one and the same territory,
but pieces of territory, the destiny of which is not
decided, and which are kept separate from the territories
of the interested States<a id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_276_276">[276]</a> under a separate administration.
Until a final settlement the interested
States do not exercise each an individual sovereignty
over these pieces, but they agree upon a joint administration
under their conjoint sovereignty.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_274_274"></a><a href="#FNanchor_274_274" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[274]</span></a> See
 Schröder, "Das grenzstreitige Gebiet von Moresnet"
(1902).</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_275_275"></a><a href="#FNanchor_275_275" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[275]</span></a> The New Hebrides are materially likewise under a
<i>condominium</i>, namely, that of Great Britain and France, although
article 1 of the Convention of October 20, 1906—see Martens, N.R.G. 3rd
Ser. I. (1909), p. 523—speaks only of "a region of joint influence"
with regard to the New Hebrides. See Brunet, "Le Régime International
des Nouvelles-Hebrides" (1908), and Politis in R.G. XIV. (1907), pp.
689-759.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_276_276"></a><a href="#FNanchor_276_276" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[276]</span></a> As regards the proposed <i>condominium</i> over Spitzbergen,
 see
Waultrin in R.G. XV. (1908), pp. 80-105, and Piccioni in R.G. XVI.
(1909), pp. 117-134.</p></div>
<p>(2) <a id="The_second_case2of171"></a>The second case is that of the administration of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
a piece of territory by a foreign Power, with the consent
of the owner-State. Thus, since 1878 the Turkish
island of Cyprus has been under British administration,
and the then Turkish provinces of Bosnia and Herzegovina
were from 1878 to 1908 under the administration
of Austria-Hungary. In these cases a cession of
pieces of territory has for all practical purposes taken
place, although in law the respective pieces still belong
to the former owner-State. Anyhow, it is certain that
only one sovereignty is exercised over these pieces—namely,
the sovereignty of the State which exercises
administration. On the other hand, however, the fact
that in these cases pieces of territory have for all practical
purposes been ceded to another State does not
empower the latter arbitrarily to annex the territory
without the consent of the State owning it in law.
Austria-Hungary had therefore no right to annex, in
1908, without the previous consent of Turkey, the
provinces of Bosnia and Herzegovina.<a id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_277_277">[277]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_277_277"></a><a href="#FNanchor_277_277" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[277]</span></a> See
 above, § <a href="#Soon_after_the_Hague50" class="pginternal">50</a>.</p></div>
<p>(3) <a id="The_third_case3of171"></a>The third case is that of a piece of territory
leased or pledged by the owner-State to a foreign Power.
Thus, China in 1898 leased<a id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_278_278">[278]</a> the district of Kiauchau
to Germany, Wei-Hai-Wei and the land opposite the
island of Hong-Kong to Great Britain, and Port Arthur
to Russia.<a id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_279_279">[279]</a> Thus, further, in 1803 Sweden pledged the
town of Wismar<a id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_280_280">[280]</a> to the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin,
and the Republic of Genoa in 1768 pledged
the island of Corsica to France. All such cases comprise,
for all practical purposes, cessions of pieces of
territory, but in strict law they remain the property
of the leasing State. And such property is not a mere<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
fiction, as some writers<a id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_281_281">[281]</a> maintain, for it is possible that
the lease comes to an end by expiration of time or by
rescission. Thus the lease, granted in 1894 by Great
Britain to the former Congo Free State, of the so-called
Lado Enclave, was rescinded<a id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_282_282">[282]</a> in 1906. However this
may be, as long as the lease has not expired it is the
lease-holder who exercises sovereignty over the territory
concerned.</p>

 below, § <a href="#The_only_form216" class="pginternal">216</a>.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_279_279"></a><a href="#FNanchor_279_279" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[279]</span></a> Russia in 1905, by the Peace Treaty of Portsmouth,
transferred her lease to Japan.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_280_280"></a><a href="#FNanchor_280_280" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[280]</span></a> This transaction took place for the sum of 1,258,000
thaler, on condition that Sweden, after the lapse of 100 years, should
be entitled to take back the town of Wismar on repayment of the money,
with 3 per cent. interest per annum. Sweden in 1903—see Martens, N.R.G.
2nd Ser. XXXI. (1905), pp. 572 and 574—formally waived her right to
retake the town.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_281_281"></a><a href="#FNanchor_281_281" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[281]</span></a> See,

 Martens, N.R.G. 2nd Ser. XXXV. (1908), p. 454.</p></div>
<p>(4) <a id="The_fourth_case4of171"></a>The fourth case is that of a piece of territory of
which the use, occupation, and control is in perpetuity
granted by the owner-State to another State with the
exclusion of the exercise of any sovereign rights over
the territory concerned on the part of the grantor. In
this way<a id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_283_283">[283]</a> the Republic of Panama transferred, in 1903,
to the United States of America a ten-mile wide strip
of territory for the purpose of constructing, administrating,
and defending the so-called Panama Canal. In
this case the grantor retains only in name the property
of the territory, the transfer of the land concerned is
really cession all but in name, and it is certain that
only the grantee exercises sovereignty there.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_283_283"></a><a href="#FNanchor_283_283" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[283]</span></a> See
 below, § <a href="#Already_in184" class="pginternal">184</a>, and Boyd in
R.G. XVII. (1910), pp. 614-624.</p></div>
<p>(5) The fifth case is that of the territory of a Federal
State. As a Federal State is considered<a id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_284_284">[284]</a> a State of
its own side by side with its single member-States, the
fact is apparent that the different territories of the
single member-States are at the same time collectively
the territory of the Federal State. But this fact is
only the consequence of the other illogical fact that
sovereignty is divided between a Federal State and its
member-States. Two different sovereignties are here
by no means exercised over one and the same territory,
for so far as the Federal State possesses sovereignty
the member-States do not, and <i>vice versa</i>.</p>

<span class="larger">II</span>
<span class="smaller">THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF STATE TERRITORY</span>
</h4>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Real and Fictional parts of Territory.</p></div>
<p>§ 172. <a id="To_the_territory_of172"></a>To the territory of a State belong not only
the land within the State boundaries, but also the so-called
territorial waters. They consist of the rivers,
canals, and lakes which water the land, and, in the case
of a State with a seacoast, of the maritime belt and
certain gulfs, bays, and straits of the sea. These different
kinds of territorial waters will be separately discussed
below in §§ 176-197. In contradistinction to
these real parts of State territory there are some things
that are either in every point or for some part treated
as though they were territorial parts of a State. They
are fictional and in a sense only parts of the territory.
Thus men-of-war and other public vessels on the high
seas as well as in foreign territorial waters are essentially
in every point treated as though they were floating
parts of their home State.<a id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_285_285">[285]</a> And the houses in which
foreign diplomatic envoys have their official residence
are in many points treated as though they were parts
of the home States of the respective envoys.<a id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_286_286">[286]</a> Again,
merchantmen on the high seas are for some points
treated as though they were floating parts of the territory
of the State under whose flag they legitimately
sail.<a id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_287_287">[287]</a></p>

water<a id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_288_288">[288]</a> is of importance on account of telegraph and
telephone wires and the like, and further on account of
the working of mines and of the building of tunnels.
A special part of territory the territorial subsoil is not,
although this is frequently asserted. But it is a universally
recognised rule of the Law of Nations that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
subsoil to an unbounded depth belongs to the State
which owns the territory on the surface.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_288_288"></a><a href="#FNanchor_288_288" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[288]</span></a> As regards the subsoil of the Open Sea, see

<div class="sidenote"><p>Territorial Atmosphere.</p></div>
<p>§ 174. The space of the territorial atmosphere is no
more a special part of territory than the territorial subsoil,
but it is of the greatest importance on account of
wires for telegraphs, telephones, electric traction, and
the like; further on account of wireless telegraphy and
of aviation.</p>
<p>(1) Nothing need be said concerning wires for telegraphs
and the like, except that obviously the territorial
State can prevent neighbouring States from making use
of its territorial atmosphere for such wires.</p>
<p>(2) As regards wireless telegraphy,<a id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_289_289">[289]</a> the "International
Radiographic Convention," signed at Berlin
on November 3, 1906, represents an agreement<a id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_290_290">[290]</a> of
the signatory Powers concerning the exchange of radio-telegrams
on the part of coast stations and ship stations,
but it contains no stipulation respecting the question in
general whether the territorial State is compelled to
allow the passage over its territory of waves emanating
from a foreign wireless telegraphy station. There ought
to be no doubt that no such compulsion exists according
to customary International Law, and that therefore the
territorial State can prevent the passage of such waves<a id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_291_291">[291]</a>
over its territory.</p>

waves from passing over its territory to the case in which the exclusion
is necessary in the interest of its security.</p></div>
<p>(3) The space of the territorial atmosphere is of
particular importance with regard to aviation, but no
customary or conventional rules of International Law<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
are as yet in existence which settle the very much
controverted<a id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_292_292">[292]</a> matter. An international conference for
the purpose of agreeing upon an international convention
concerning aviation met in 1910 at Paris, but did
not produce any result. The fact is that, since aviation
is still in its infancy, practical experience is lacking
concerning many questions which can only be settled
when aviation has been more developed. It is tempting
to apply the rules concerning the maritime belt and
the Open Sea analogously to the space of the atmosphere,
and, therefore, to distinguish between a zone
of a certain height, in which the territorial State can
exercise sovereignty, and, on the other hand, the atmosphere
beyond that height, which is to be considered
free like the Open Sea. This comparison between the
atmosphere and the sea is, however, faulty for two
reasons. Firstly, the Open Sea is an international highway
that connects distant lands between which, except
by sea, no communication would be possible, whereas
the atmosphere is not such an indispensable highway.
Secondly, navigation on the Open Sea comprises no
danger whatever to the security of the different States
and the lives and property of their inhabitants, whereas
aviation threatens such danger to a great extent. The
chief question at issue is, therefore, whether the territorial
State should or should not be considered to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
exercise sovereignty over the space of the atmosphere
to an unbounded height, and to have the power to
prevent the passage of foreign aviators altogether, or to
enact stringent rules with which they have to comply.
It would probably be best for the States in conference
to adopt such rules concerning the whole space of the
atmosphere as are similar to those valid by customary
International Law for the maritime belt, that is:—to
recognise, on the one hand, sovereignty of the territorial
State over the space of its atmosphere, but, on the other
hand, to give a right to foreign States to demand from
the territorial State that foreign private—but not
public!—air-vessels may pass through its atmosphere,
provided they comply with the rules enacted by the
territorial State for the aerial traffic.<a id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_293_293">[293]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Rivers State property of Riparian States.</p></div>
<p>§ 176. Theory and practice agree upon the rule that
rivers are part of the territory of the riparian State.
Consequently, if a river lies wholly, that is, from its
source to its mouth, within the boundaries of one and
the same State, such State owns it exclusively. As
such rivers are under the sway of one State only and
exclusively, they are named "national rivers." Thus,
all English, Scotch, and Irish rivers are national, and
so are, to give some Continental examples, the Seine,
Loire, and Garonne, which are French; the Tiber,
which is Italian; the Volga, which is Russian. But
many rivers do not run through the land of one and
the same State only, whether they are so-called "boundary
rivers," that is, rivers which separate two different<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
States from each other, or whether they run through
several States and are therefore named "not-national
rivers." Such rivers are not owned by one State alone.
Boundary rivers belong to the territory of the States
they separate, the boundary line<a id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_296_296">[296]</a> running either
through the middle of the river or through the middle
of the so-called mid-channel of the river. And rivers
which run through several States belong to the territories
of the States concerned; each State owns that
part of the river which runs through its territory.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_296_296"></a><a href="#FNanchor_296_296" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[296]</span></a> See
 below, § <a href="#Natural_boundaries199" class="pginternal">199</a>, and Huber in Z.V. I. (1906), pp. 29 and
159.</p></div>
<p>There is, however, another group of rivers to be
mentioned, which comprises all such rivers as are navigable
from the Open Sea and at the same time either
separate or pass through several States between their
sources and their mouths. Such rivers, too, belong to
the territory of the different States concerned, but they
are nevertheless named "international rivers," because
freedom of navigation in time of peace on all of those
rivers in Europe and on many of them outside Europe
for merchantmen of all nations is recognised by International
Law.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Navigation on National, Boundary and not-National Rivers.</p></div>
<p>§ 177. There is no rule of the Law of Nations in
existence which grants foreign States the right of admittance
of their public or private vessels to navigation
on national rivers. In the absence of commercial or
other treaties granting such a right, every State can
exclude foreign vessels from its national rivers or admit
them under certain conditions only, such as the payment
of a due and the like. The teaching of Grotius
(II. c. 2, § 12) that innocent passage through rivers
must be granted has not been recognised by the practice
of the States, and Bluntschli's assertion (§ 314)
that such rivers as are navigable from the Open Sea
must in time of peace be open to vessels of all nations,
is at best an anticipation of a future rule of International
Law, it does not as yet exist.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>
<p>As regards boundary rivers and rivers running
through several States, the riparian States<a id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_297_297">[297]</a> can regulate
navigation on such parts of these rivers as they
own, and they can certainly exclude vessels of non-riparian
States altogether unless prevented therefrom
by virtue of special treaties.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_297_297"></a><a href="#FNanchor_297_297" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[297]</span></a> See

<div class="sidenote"><p>Navigation on International Rivers.</p></div>
<p>§ 178. <a id="Whereas_there_is_certainly178"></a>Whereas there is certainly no recognised
principle of free navigation on national, boundary, and
not-national rivers, a movement for the recognition of
free navigation on international rivers set in at the
beginning of the nineteenth century. Until the French
Revolution towards the end of the eighteenth century,
the riparian States of such rivers as are now called
international rivers could, in the absence of special
treaties, exclude foreign vessels altogether from those
parts of the rivers which run through their territory,
or admit them under discretionary conditions. Thus,
the river Scheldt was wholly shut up in favour of the
Netherlands according to article 14 of the Peace Treaty
of Munster of 1648 between the Netherlands and Spain.
The development of things in the contrary direction
begins with a Decree of the French Convention, dated
November 16, 1792, which opens the rivers Scheldt and
Meuse to the vessels of all riparian States. But it was
not until the Vienna Congress<a id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_298_298">[298]</a> in 1815 that the principle
of free navigation on the international rivers of
Europe by merchantmen of not only the riparian but
of all States was proclaimed. The Congress itself realised
theoretically that principle in making arrangements<a id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_299_299">[299]</a>
for free navigation on the rivers Scheldt, Meuse, Rhine,
and on the navigable tributaries of the latter—namely,
the rivers Neckar, Maine, and Moselle—although more
than fifty years elapsed before the principle became
realised in practice.</p>

 Martens, N.R. II. p. 434.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p></div>
<p>The next step was taken by the Peace Treaty of
Paris of 1856, which by its article 15<a id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_300_300">[300]</a> stipulated free
navigation on the Danube and expressly declared the
principle of the Vienna Congress regarding free navigation
on international rivers for merchantmen of all
nations as a part of "European Public Law." A
special international organ for the regulation of navigation
on the Danube was created, the so-called European
Danube Commission.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_300_300"></a><a href="#FNanchor_300_300" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[300]</span></a> See
 Martens, N.R.G. XV. p. 776. The documents concerning
navigation on the Danube are collected by Sturdza, "Recueil de documents
relatifs à la liberté de navigation du Danube" (Berlin, 1904).</p></div>
<p>A further development took place at the Congo
Conference at Berlin in 1884-85, since the General Act<a id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_301_301">[301]</a>
of this Conference stipulated free navigation on the
rivers Congo and Niger and their tributaries, and
created the so-called "International Congo Commission"
as a special international organ for the regulation
of the navigation of the said rivers.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_301_301"></a><a href="#FNanchor_301_301" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[301]</span></a> See
 Martens, N.R.G. 2nd Ser.
X. p. 417.</p></div>
<p>Side by side with these general treaties, which recognise
free navigation on international rivers, stand
treaties<a id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_302_302">[302]</a> of several South American States with other
States concerning free navigation for merchantmen of
all nations on a number of South American rivers. And
the Arbitration Court in the case of the boundary
dispute between Great Britain and Venezuela decided
in 1903 in favour of free navigation for merchantmen
of all nations on the rivers Amakourou and Barima.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_302_302"></a><a href="#FNanchor_302_302" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[302]</span></a> See
 Taylor, § 238, and Moore, I.
§ 131, pp. 639-651.</p></div>
<p>Thus the principle of free navigation, which is a
settled fact as regards all European and some African
international rivers, becomes more and more extended
over all other international rivers of the world. But
when several writers maintain that free navigation on
all international rivers of the world is already a recognised
rule of the Law of Nations, they are decidedly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
wrong, although such a universal rule will certainly be
proclaimed in the future. There can be no doubt that
as regards the South American rivers the principle is
recognised by treaties between a small number of Powers
only. And there are examples which show that the
principle is not yet universally recognised. Thus by
article 4 of the Treaty of Washington of 1854 between
Great Britain and the United States the former grants
to vessels of the latter free navigation on the river St.
Lawrence as a revocable privilege, and article 26 of the
Treaty of Washington of 1871 stipulates for vessels of
the United States, but not for vessels of other nations,
free navigation "for ever" on the same river.<a id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_303_303">[303]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_303_303"></a><a href="#FNanchor_303_303" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[303]</span></a> See
 Wharton, pp. 81-83; Moore, I. § 131, p. 631, and Hall,
§ 39.</p></div>
<p>However this may be, the principle of free navigation
embodies the rule that vessels of all nations must
be admitted without payment of any dues whatever.
Yet this principle does not exclude the levy of dues
from all navigating vessels for expenses incurred by
the riparian States for such improvements of the navigability
of rivers as embankments, breakwaters, and the
like.<a id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_304_304">[304]</a></p>

the rivers Rhine and Elbe, see Arndt in Z.V. IV. (1910), pp. 208-229.</p></div>
<p>I should mention that the Institute of International
Law, at its meeting at Heidelberg in 1888, adopted a
<i>Projet de Règlement international de navigation fluviale</i>,<a id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_305_305">[305]</a>
which comprises forty articles.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Utilisation of the flow of rivers.</p></div>
<p>§ 178<i>a</i>. <a id="Apart_from_navigation178a"></a>Apart from navigation on rivers, the question
of the utilisation of the flow of rivers is of importance.
With regard to national rivers, the question can
not indeed be raised, since the local State is absolutely
unhindered in the utilisation of the flow. But the flow
of not-national, boundary, and international rivers is
not within the arbitrary power of one of the riparian
States, for it is a rule of International Law<a id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_306_306">[306]</a> that no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
State is allowed to alter the natural conditions of its
own territory to the disadvantage of the natural conditions
of the territory of a neighbouring State. For
this reason a State is not only forbidden to stop or to
divert the flow of a river which runs from its own to a
neighbouring State, but likewise to make such use of
the water of the river as either causes danger to the
neighbouring State or prevents it from making proper
use<a id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_307_307">[307]</a> of the flow of the river on its part. Since, apart
from special treaties between neighbouring countries
concerning special cases, neither customary nor conventional
detailed rules of International Law concerning
this subject are in existence, the Institute of International
Law, at its meeting at Madrid<a id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_308_308">[308]</a> in 1911, adopted
the following "<i>Réglementation internationale des cours

is Italian territory. As regards, however, such lakes
and land-locked seas as are surrounded by the territories
of several States, no unanimity exists. The majority
of writers consider these lakes and land-locked seas
parts of the surrounding territories, but several<a id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_309_309">[309]</a> dissent,
asserting that these lakes and seas do not belong
to the riparian States, but are free like the Open Sea.
The practice of the States seems to favour the opinion
of the majority of writers, for special treaties frequently
arrange what portions of such lakes and seas belong to
the riparian States.<a id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_310_310">[310]</a> Examples are:—The Lake of
Constance,<a id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_311_311">[311]</a> which is surrounded by the territories of
Germany (Baden, Würtemberg, Bavaria), Austria, and
Switzerland (Thurgau and St. Gall); the Lake of
Geneva, which belongs to Switzerland and France; the
Lakes of Huron, Erie, and Ontario, which belong to
British Canada and the United States; the Caspian Sea,
which belongs to Persia and Russia.<a id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_312_312">[312]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>So-called International Lakes and Land-locked Seas.</p></div>
<p>§ 180. In analogy with so-called international rivers,
such lakes and land-locked seas as are surrounded by
the territories of several States and are at the same
time navigable from the Open Sea, are called "international
lakes and land-locked seas." However, although
some writers<a id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_313_313">[313]</a> dissent, it must be emphasised
that hitherto the Law of Nations has not recognised
the principle of free navigation on such lakes and seas.
The only case in which such free navigation is stipulated
is that of the lakes within the Congo district.<a id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_314_314">[314]</a> But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
there is no doubt that in a near future this principle will
be recognised, and practically all so-called international
lakes and land-locked seas are actually open to merchantmen
of all nations. Good examples of such international
lakes and land-locked seas are the fore-named
lakes of Huron, Erie, and Ontario.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>The Black Sea.</p></div>
<p>§ 181. <a id="It181"></a>It is of interest to give some details regarding
the Black Sea. This is a land-locked sea which was
undoubtedly wholly a part of Turkish territory as long
as the enclosing land was Turkish only, and as long as
the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles, the approach to the
Black Sea, which are exclusively part of Turkish territory,
were not open for merchantmen of all nations.
But matters have changed through Russia, Roumania,
and Bulgaria having become littoral States. It would
be wrong to maintain that now the Black Sea belongs
to the territories of the four States, for the Bosphorus
and the Dardanelles, although belonging to Turkish
territory, are nevertheless parts of the Mediterranean
Sea, and are now open to merchantmen of all nations.
The Black Sea is consequently now part of the Open
Sea<a id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_315_315">[315]</a> and is not the property of any State. Article 11
of the Peace Treaty of Paris,<a id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_316_316">[316]</a> 1856, neutralised the
Black Sea, declared it open to merchantmen of all
nations, but interdicted it to men-of-war of the littoral
as well as of other States, admitting only a few Turkish
and Russian public vessels for the service of their coasts.
But although the neutralisation was stipulated "formally
and in perpetuity," it lasted only till 1870. In
that year, during the Franco-German War, Russia shook
off the restrictions of the Treaty of Paris, and the Powers
assembled at the Conference of London signed on
March 13, 1871, the Treaty of London,<a id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_317_317">[317]</a> by which the
neutralisation of the Black Sea and the exclusion of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
men-of-war therefrom were abolished. But the right of
the Porte to forbid foreign men-of-war passage through
the Dardanelles and the Bosphorus<a id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_318_318">[318]</a> was upheld by that
treaty, as was also free navigation for merchantmen of
all nations on the Black Sea.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Canals State Property of Riparian States.</p></div>
<p>§ 182. That canals are parts of the territories of the
respective territorial States is obvious from the fact
that they are artificially constructed waterways. And
there ought to be no doubt<a id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_319_319">[319]</a> that all the rules regarding
rivers must analogously be applied to canals. The
matter would need no special mention at all were it not
for the interoceanic canals which have been constructed
during the second half of the nineteenth century or are
contemplated in the future. And as regards two of
these, the Emperor William (Kiel or Baltic) Canal,
which connects the Baltic with the North Sea, and the
Corinth Canal, which connects the Gulf of Corinth with
the Gulf of Ægina, there is not much to be said. The
former is a canal made mainly for strategic purposes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
by the German Empire entirely through German territory.
Although Germany keeps it open for navigation
to vessels of all other nations, she exclusively controls
the navigation thereof, and can at any moment exclude
foreign vessels at discretion, or admit them upon any
conditions she likes, apart from special treaty arrangements
to the contrary. The Corinth Canal is entirely
within the territory of Greece, and although the canal
is kept open for navigation to vessels of all nations,
Greece exclusively controls the navigation thereof.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_319_319"></a><a href="#FNanchor_319_319" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[319]</span></a> See,
 however, Holland, Studies, p. 278.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>The Suez Canal.</p></div>
<p>§ 183. <a id="The_most_important183"></a>The most important of the interoceanic canals
is that of Suez, which connects the Red Sea with the
Mediterranean. Already in 1838 Prince Metternich
gave his opinion that such a canal, if ever made, ought
to become neutralised by an international treaty of the
Powers. When, in 1869, the Suez Canal was opened,
jurists and diplomatists at once discussed what means
could be found to secure free navigation upon it for
vessels of all kinds and all nations in time of peace as
well as of war. In 1875 Sir Travers Twiss<a id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_320_320">[320]</a> proposed
the neutralisation of the canal, and in 1879 the Institute
of International Law gave its vote<a id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_321_321">[321]</a> in favour of the
protection of free navigation on the canal by an international
treaty. In 1883 Great Britain proposed an
international conference to the Powers for the purpose of
neutralising the canal, but it took several years before
an agreement was actualised. This was done by the
Convention of Constantinople<a id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_322_322">[322]</a> of October 29, 1888,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
between Great Britain, Austria-Hungary, France, Germany,
Holland, Italy, Spain, Russia, and Turkey. This
treaty comprises seventeen articles, whose more important
stipulations are the following:—</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_320_320"></a><a href="#FNanchor_320_320" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[320]</span></a> See

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_322_322"></a><a href="#FNanchor_322_322" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[322]</span></a> See
 Martens, N.R.G. 2nd, Ser. XV. p. 557. It must, however,
be mentioned that Great Britain is a party to the Convention of
Constantinople under the reservation that its terms shall not be brought
into operation in so far as they would not be compatible with the
transitory and exceptional condition in which Egypt is put for the time
being in consequence of her occupation by British forces, and in so far
as they might fetter the liberty of action of the British Government
during the occupation of Egypt. But article 6 of the Declaration
respecting Egypt and Morocco signed at London on April 8, 1904, by Great
Britain and France (see Parliamentary Papers, France, No. 1 (1904), p.
9), has done away with this reservation, since it stipulates the
following:—"In order to ensure the free passage of the Suez Canal, his
Britannic Majesty's Government declare that they adhere to the
stipulations of the Treaty of October 29, 1888, and that they agree to
their being put in force. The free passage of the canal being thus
guaranteed, the execution of the last sentence of paragraph 1 as well as
of paragraph 2 of article 8 of that treaty will remain in abeyance."
(See Holland, Studies, p. 293, and Westlake, I. p. 328.)</p></div>
<p>(1) The canal is open in time of peace as well as of
war to merchantmen and men-of-war of all nations.
No attempt to restrict this free usage of the canal is
allowed in time either of peace or of war. The canal
can never be blockaded (article 1).</p>
<p>(2) In time of war, even if Turkey is a belligerent,
no act of hostility is allowed either inside the canal
itself or within three sea miles from its ports. Men-of-war
of the belligerents have to pass through the canal
without delay. They may not stay longer than twenty-four
hours, a case of absolute necessity excepted, within
the harbours of Port Said and Suez, and twenty-four
hours must intervene between the departure from those
harbours of a belligerent man-of-war and a vessel of
the enemy. Troops, munitions, and other war material
may neither be shipped nor unshipped within the canal
and its harbours. All rules regarding belligerents' men-of-war
are likewise valid for their prizes (articles 4, 5, 6).</p>
<p>(3) No men-of-war are allowed to be stationed inside
the canal, but each Power may station two men-of-war
in the harbours of Port Said and Suez. Belligerents,
however, are not allowed to station men-of-war in these
harbours (article 7). No permanent fortifications are
allowed in the canal (article 2).</p>
<p>(4) It is the task of Egypt to secure the carrying
out of the stipulated rules, but the consuls of the Powers
in Egypt are charged to watch the execution of these
rules (articles 8 and 9).<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p>
<p>(5) The signatory Powers are obliged to notify the
treaty to others and to invite them to accede thereto

<div class="sidenote"><p>The Panama Canal.</p></div>
<p>§ 184. <a id="Already_in184"></a>Already in 1850 Great Britain and the United
States in the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty<a id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_323_323">[323]</a> of Washington
had stipulated the free navigation and neutralisation of
a canal between the Pacific and the Atlantic Ocean
proposed to be constructed by the way of the river St.
Juan de Nicaragua and either or both of the lakes of
Nicaragua and Managua. In 1881 the building of a
canal through the Isthmus of Panama was taken in
hand, but in 1888 the works were stopped in consequence
of the financial collapse of the Company undertaking
its construction. After this the United States
came back to the old project of a canal by the way of
the river St. Juan de Nicaragua. For the eventuality
of the completion of this canal, Great Britain and the
United States signed, on February 5, 1900, the Convention
of Washington, which stipulated free navigation
on and neutralisation of the proposed canal in analogy
with the Convention of Constantinople, 1888, regarding
the Suez Canal, but ratification was refused by the
Senate of the United States. In the following year,
however, on November 18, 1901, another treaty was
signed and afterwards ratified. This so-called Hay-Pauncefote
Treaty<a id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_324_324">[324]</a> applies to a canal between the
Atlantic and Pacific Oceans by whatever route may
be considered expedient, and its five articles are the
following:—</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_323_323"></a><a href="#FNanchor_323_323" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[323]</span></a> See
 Martens, N.R.G. XV. p. 187, and Moore, III. §§ 351-365.
According to its article 8 this treaty was also to be applied to a
proposed canal through the Isthmus of Panama.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_324_324"></a><a href="#FNanchor_324_324" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[324]</span></a> See
 Moore, III. §§ 366-368.</p></div>
<p>
Article 1<br>
</p>
<p>The High Contracting Parties agree that the present
Treaty shall supersede the aforementioned Convention of April
19, 1850.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>
<p>
Article 2<br>
</p>
<p>It is agreed that the canal may be constructed under the
auspices of the Government of the United States, either directly
at its own cost, or by gift or loan of money to individuals or
corporations, or through subscription to or purchase of stock or
shares, and that, subject to the provisions of the present Treaty,
the said Government shall have and enjoy all the rights incident
to such construction, as well as the exclusive right of providing
for the regulation and management of the canal.</p>
<p>
Article 3<br>
</p>
<p>The United States adopts, as the basis of the neutralisation
of such ship canal, the following Rules, substantially as embodied
in the Convention of Constantinople, signed October 29,
1888, for the free navigation of the Suez Canal, that is to say:—</p>
<p>1. The canal shall be free and open to the vessels of commerce
and of war of all nations observing these Rules, on terms
of entire equality, so that there shall be no discrimination against
any such nation, or its citizens or subjects, in respect of the
conditions or charges of traffic, or otherwise. Such conditions
and charges of traffic shall be just and equitable.</p>
<p>2. The canal shall never be blockaded, nor shall any right
of war be exercised or any act of hostility be committed within
it. The United States, however, shall be at liberty to maintain
such military police along the canal as may be necessary to
protect<a id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_325_325">[325]</a> it against lawlessness and disorder.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_325_325"></a><a href="#FNanchor_325_325" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[325]</span></a> This does not mean that the United States have a right
permanently to fortify the canal. Such a right has likewise been deduced
from article 23 of the Hay-Varilla Treaty of November 18, 1903, which
runs:—"If it should become necessary at any time to employ armed forces
for the safety or protection of the canal, or of the ships that make use
of the same, or the railways and auxiliary works, the United States
shall have the right, at all times in its discretion, to use its police
and its land and naval forces or to establish fortifications for these
purposes." However, it would seem that by this article 23 only temporary
fortifications are contemplated. On the other hand, if read by itself,
article 3 of the Hay-Varilla Treaty, according to which the Republic of
Panama grants to the United States all the rights, power, and authority
which the United States would possess and exercise if she were the
sovereign of the territory concerned, could be quoted as indirectly
empowering the United States to fortify the Panama Canal permanently.
But the question is whether article 3 must not be interpreted in
connection with article 23. The fact that article 23 stipulates
expressly the power of the United States temporarily to establish
fortifications would seem to indicate that it was intended to exclude
permanent fortifications. The question of the fortification of the
Panama Canal is discussed by Hains (<i>contra</i>) and Davis (<i>pro</i>) in A.J.
III. (1909), pp. 354-394 and pp. 885-908, and by Olney, Wambough, and
Kennedy in A.J. V. (1911), pp. 298, 615, 620.</p></div>
<p>3. Vessels of war of a belligerent shall not revictual nor take
any stores in the canal except so far as may be strictly necessary;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
and the transit of such vessels through the canal shall
be effected with the least possible delay in accordance with the
regulations in force, and with only such intermission as may
result from the necessities of the service.</p>
<p>Prizes shall be in all respects subject to the same rules as
vessels of war of belligerents.</p>
<p>4. No belligerent shall embark or disembark troops, munitions
of war, or warlike materials in the canal, except in case
of accidental hindrance of the transit, and in such case the
transit shall be resumed with all possible despatch.</p>
<p>5. The provisions of this article shall apply to waters adjacent
to the canal, within three marine miles of either end.
Vessels of war of a belligerent shall not remain in such waters
longer than twenty-four hours at any one time except in case
of distress, and in such case shall depart as soon as possible;
but a vessel of war of one belligerent shall not depart within
twenty-four hours from the departure of a vessel of war of the
other belligerent.</p>
<p>6. The plant, establishments, buildings and all works necessary
to the construction, maintenance, and operation of the
canal shall be deemed to be part thereof, for the purposes of
this Treaty, and in time of war, as in time of peace, shall enjoy
complete immunity from attack or injury by belligerents, and
from acts calculated to impair their usefulness as part of the
canal.</p>
<p>
Article 4<br>
</p>
<p>It is agreed that no change of territorial sovereignty or of
the international relations of the country or countries traversed
by the before-mentioned canal shall affect the general principle
of neutralisation or the obligation of the high contracting parties
under the present Treaty.</p>
<p>
Article 5<br>
</p>
<p>The present Treaty shall be ratified by his Britannic Majesty
and by the President of the United States, by and with the
advice and consent of the Senate thereof; and the ratifications
shall be exchanged at Washington or at London at the earliest
possible time within six months from the date hereof.</p>
<p>In faith whereof the respective Plenipotentiaries have signed
this Treaty and thereunto affixed their seals.</p>

to the United States in perpetuity for the construction,
administration, and protection of a canal between Colon
and Panama the use, occupation, and control of a strip
of land required for the construction of the canal, and,
further, of land on both sides of the canal to the extent
of five miles on either side, with the exclusion, however,
of the cities of Panama and Colon and the harbours
adjacent to these cities. According to article 18 of this

<div class="sidenote"><p>State Property of Maritime Belt contested.</p></div>
<p>§ 185. <a id="Maritime_belt185"></a>Maritime belt is that part of the sea which,
in contradistinction to the Open Sea, is under the sway
of the littoral States. But no unanimity exists with
regard to the nature of the sway of the littoral States.
Many writers maintain that such sway is sovereignty,
that the maritime belt is a part of the territory of the
littoral State, and that the territorial supremacy of the
latter extends over its coast waters. Whereas it is
nowadays universally recognised that the Open Sea
cannot be State property, such part of the sea as makes
the coast waters would, according to the opinion of
these writers, actually be the State property of the
littoral States, although foreign States have a right of
innocent passage of their merchantmen through the
coast waters.</p>
<p>On the other hand, many writers of great authority
emphatically deny the territorial character of the maritime
belt and concede to the littoral States, in the
interest of the safety of the coast, only certain powers of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
control, jurisdiction, police, and the like, but not sovereignty.</p>
<p>This is surely erroneous, since the real facts of
international life would seem to agree with the first-mentioned
opinion only. Its supporters rightly maintain<a id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_328_328">[328]</a>
that the universally recognised fact of the exclusive
right of the littoral State to appropriate the natural
products of the sea in the coast waters, especially the
use of the fishery therein, can coincide only with the
territorial character of the maritime belt. The argument
of their opponents that, if the belt is to be considered
a part of State territory, every littoral State
must have the right to cede and exchange its coast waters,
can properly be met by the statement that territorial
waters of all kinds are inalienable appurtenances<a id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_329_329">[329]</a> of
the littoral and riparian States.<a id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_330_330">[330]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_328_328"></a><a href="#FNanchor_328_328" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[328]</span></a> Hall, p. 158. The question is treated with great clearness
by Heilborn, "System," pp. 37-57, and Schücking, pp. 14-20.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_329_329"></a><a href="#FNanchor_329_329" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[329]</span></a> See
 above, § <a href="#It_should_be_mentioned175" class="pginternal">175</a>. Bynkershoek's ("De Dominio Maris," c. 5)
opinion that a littoral State can alienate its maritime belt without the
coast itself, is at the present day untenable.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_330_330"></a><a href="#FNanchor_330_330" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[330]</span></a> The fact that art. I. of Convention 13 (Neutral Rights and
Duties in Maritime War) of the second Hague Peace Conference, 1907,
speaks of sovereign rights ... in neutral waters would seem to indicate
that the States themselves consider their sway over the maritime belt to
be of the nature of sovereignty.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Breadth of Maritime Belt.</p></div>
<p>§ 186. Be that as it may, the question arises how
far into the sea those waters extend which are coast
waters and are therefore under the sway of the littoral
State. Here, too, no unanimity exists upon either the
starting line of the belt on the coast or the breadth
itself of the belt from such starting line.</p>
<p>(1) Whereas the starting line is sometimes drawn
along high-water mark, many writers draw it along
low-water mark. Others draw it along the depths
where the waters cease to be navigable; others again
along those depths where coast batteries can still be
erected, and so on.<a id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_331_331">[331]</a> But the number of those who
draw it along low-water mark is increasing. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
Institute of International Law<a id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_332_332">[332]</a> has voted in favour
of this starting line, and many treaties stipulate the
same.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_331_331"></a><a href="#FNanchor_331_331" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[331]</span></a> See
 Schücking, p. 13.</p></div>

 Annuaire, XIII. p. 329.</p></div>
<p>(2) With regard to the breadth of the maritime belt
various opinions have in former times been held, and
very exorbitant claims have been advanced by different
States. And although Bynkershoek's rule that <i>terrae
potestas finitur ubi finitur armorum vis</i> is now generally
recognised by theory and practice, and consequently a
belt of such breadth is considered under the sway of
the littoral State as is within effective range of the
shore batteries, there is still no unanimity on account
of the fact that such range is day by day increasing.
Since at the end of the eighteenth century the range of
artillery was about three miles, or one marine league,
that distance became generally<a id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_333_333">[333]</a> recognised as the
breadth of the maritime belt. But no sooner was a
common doctrine originated than the range of projectiles
increased with the manufacture of heavier guns.
And although Great Britain, France, Austria, the United
States of America, and other States, in Municipal Laws
and International Treaties still adhere to a breadth of
one marine league, the time will come when by a common
agreement of the States such breadth will be very
much extended.<a id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_334_334">[334]</a> As regards Great Britain, the Territorial
Waters Jurisdiction Act<a id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_335_335">[335]</a> of 1878 (41 and 42
Vict. c. 73) specially recognises the extent of the
territorial maritime belt as three miles, or one marine
league, measured from the low-water mark of the
coast.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_333_333"></a><a href="#FNanchor_333_333" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[333]</span></a> But not universally. Thus Norway claims a breadth of four
miles and Spain even a breadth of six miles. As regards Norway, see
 Aubert in R.G. I. (1894), pp. 429-441.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_334_334"></a><a href="#FNanchor_334_334" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[334]</span></a> The Institute of International Law has voted in favour of
six miles, or two marine leagues, as the breadth of the belt. See
 Annuaire, XIII. p. 281.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Fisheries, Cabotage, Police, and Maritime Ceremonials within
the Belt.</p></div>
<p>§ 187. <a id="Theory_and_practice_agree187"></a>Theory and practice agree upon the following<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
principles with regard to fisheries, cabotage, police, and
maritime ceremonials within the maritime belt:—</p>
<p>(1) The littoral State can exclusively reserve the
fishery within the maritime belt<a id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_336_336">[336]</a> for its own subjects,
whether fish or pearls or amber or other products of
the sea are in consideration.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_336_336"></a><a href="#FNanchor_336_336" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[336]</span></a> All treaties stipulate for the purpose of fishery a three
miles wide territorial maritime belt. See, for instance, article 1 of
the Hague Convention concerning police and fishery in the North Sea of
May 6, 1882. (Martens, N.R.G. 2nd Ser. IX. p. 556.)</p></div>
<p>(2) The littoral State can, in the absence of special
treaties to the contrary, exclude foreign vessels from
navigation and trade along the coast, the so-called
cabotage,<a id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_337_337">[337]</a> and reserve this cabotage exclusively for its
own vessels. Cabotage meant originally navigation and
trade along the same stretch of coast between the ports
thereof, such coast belonging to the territory of one and
the same State. However, the term cabotage or coasting
trade as used in commercial treaties comprises now<a id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_338_338">[338]</a>
sea trade between any two ports of the same country,
whether on the same coasts or different coasts, provided
always that the different coasts are all of them
the coasts of one and the same country as a political
and geographical unit in contradistinction to the coasts
of colonial dependencies of such country.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_337_337"></a><a href="#FNanchor_337_337" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[337]</span></a> See
 Pradier-Fodéré, V. Nos. 2441, 2442.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_338_338"></a><a href="#FNanchor_338_338" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[338]</span></a> See
 below, § <a href="#The_meaning_of_the_term579" class="pginternal">579</a>, where the matter is more amply treated.</p></div>
<p>(3) The littoral State can exclusively exercise police
and control within its maritime belt in the interest of
its custom-house duties, the secrecy of its coast fortifications,
and the like. Thus foreign vessels can be
ordered to take certain routes and to avoid others.</p>
<p>(4) The littoral State can make laws and regulations
regarding maritime ceremonials to be observed
by such foreign merchantmen as enter its territorial
maritime belt.<a id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_339_339">[339]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Navigation within the Belt.</p></div>
<p>§ 188. <a id="Although_the_maritime188"></a>Although the maritime belt is a portion of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
the territory of the littoral State and therefore under
the absolute territorial supremacy of such State, the
belt is nevertheless, according to the practice of all the
States, open to merchantmen of all nations for inoffensive
navigation, cabotage excepted. And it is the
common conviction<a id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_340_340">[340]</a> that every State has by customary
International Law the <i>right</i> to demand that in time of
peace its merchantmen may inoffensively pass through
the territorial maritime belt of every other State. Such
right is correctly said to be a consequence of the freedom
of the Open Sea, for without this right navigation on
the Open Sea by vessels of all nations would in fact
be an impossibility. And it is a consequence of this
right that no State can levy tolls for the mere passage
of foreign vessels through its maritime belt. Although
the littoral State may spend a considerable amount of
money for the erection and maintenance of lighthouses
and other facilities for safe navigation within its maritime
belt, it cannot make merely passing foreign vessels
pay for such outlays. It is only when foreign ships
cast anchor within the belt or enter a port that they
can be made to pay dues and tolls by the littoral State.
Some writers<a id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_341_341">[341]</a> maintain that all nations have the right
of inoffensive passage for their merchantmen by usage
only, and not by the customary Law of Nations, and
that, consequently, in strict law a littoral State can
prevent such passage. They are certainly mistaken.
An attempt on the part of a littoral State to prevent
free navigation through the maritime belt in time of
peace would meet with stern opposition on the part of
all other States.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_340_340"></a><a href="#FNanchor_340_340" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[340]</span></a> See

<p>But a right of foreign States for their men-of-war
to pass unhindered through the maritime belt is not
generally recognised. Although many writers assert
the existence of such a right, many others emphatically<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
deny it. As a rule, however, in practice no State
actually opposes in time of peace the passage of foreign
men-of-war and other public vessels through its maritime
belt. And it may safely be stated, first, that a
usage has grown up by which such passage, if in every
way inoffensive and without danger, shall not be denied
in time of peace; and, secondly, that it is now a customary
rule of International Law that the right of
passage through such parts of the maritime belt as
form part of the highways for international traffic
cannot be denied to foreign men-of-war.<a id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_342_342">[342]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Jurisdiction within the Belt.</p></div>
<p>§ 189. <a id="That_the_littoral189"></a>That the littoral State has exclusive jurisdiction
within the belt as regards mere matters of police
and control is universally recognised. Thus it can
exclude foreign pilots, can make custom-house arrangements,
sanitary regulations, laws concerning stranded
vessels and goods, and the like. It is further agreed
that foreign merchantmen casting anchor within the
belt or entering a port,<a id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_343_343">[343]</a> fall at once and <i>ipso facto</i> under
the jurisdiction of the littoral State. But it is a moot
point whether such foreign vessels as do not stay but
merely pass through the belt are for the time being
under this jurisdiction. It is for this reason that the
British Territorial Waters Jurisdiction Act of 1878 (41
&amp; 42 Vict. c. 73), which claims such jurisdiction, has
called forth protests from many writers.<a id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_344_344">[344]</a> The controversy
itself can be decided only by the practice of
the States. The British Act quoted, the basis of
which is, in my opinion, sound and reasonable, is a
powerful factor in initiating such a practice; but as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
yet no common practice of the States can be said
to exist.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_343_343"></a><a href="#FNanchor_343_343" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[343]</span></a> The Institute of International Law—see
 Annuaire, XVII.
(1898), p. 273—adopted at its meeting at the Hague in 1898 a
"<i>Règlement</i> sur le régime légal des navires et de leurs équipages dans
les ports étrangers" comprising seven rules.</p></div>

 Perels, pp. 69-77. The Institute of International Law,
which at its meeting at Paris in 1894 adopted a body of eleven rules
regarding the maritime belt, gulfs, bays, and straits, voted against the
jurisdiction of a littoral State over foreign vessels merely passing
through the belt. See Annuaire, XIII. p. 328.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Zone for Revenue and Sanitary Laws.</p></div>
<p>§ 190. <a id="Different_from_the_territorial190"></a>Different from the territorial maritime belt
is the zone of the Open Sea, over which a littoral State
extends the operation of its revenue and sanitary laws.
The fact is that Great Britain and the United States,
as well as other States, possess revenue and sanitary
laws which impose certain duties not only on their own
but also on such foreign vessels bound to one of their
ports as are approaching, but not yet within, their
territorial maritime belt.<a id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_345_345">[345]</a> Twiss and Phillimore agree
that in strict law these Municipal Laws have no basis,
since every State is by the Law of Nations prevented
from extending its jurisdiction over the Open Sea, and
that it is only the Comity of Nations which admits
tacitly the operation of such Municipal Laws as long as
foreign States do not object, and provided that no
measure is taken within the territorial maritime belt
of another nation. I doubt not that in time special
arrangements will be made as regards this point by
a universal international convention. But I believe
that, since Municipal Laws of the above kind have been
in existence for more than a hundred years and have
not been opposed by other States, a customary rule of
the Law of Nations may be said to exist which allows
littoral States in the interest of their revenue and sanitary
laws to impose certain duties on such foreign
vessels bound to their ports as are approaching, although
not yet within, their territorial maritime belt.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Territorial Gulfs and Bays.</p></div>
<p>§ 191. <a id="It_is_generally_admitted191"></a>It is generally admitted that such gulfs and
bays as are enclosed by the land of one and the same
littoral State, and whose entrance from the sea is narrow
enough to be commanded by coast batteries erected
on one or both sides of the entrance, belong to the
territory of the littoral State even if the entrance is
wider<a id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_346_346">[346]</a> than two marine leagues, or six miles.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_346_346"></a><a href="#FNanchor_346_346" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[346]</span></a> I have no reason to alter the above statement, although
Lord Fitzmaurice declared in the House of Lords on February 21, 1907, in
the name of the British Government, that they considered such bays only
to be territorial as possessed an entrance <i>not</i> wider than six miles.
The future will have to show whether Great Britain and her
self-governing colonies consider themselves bound by this statement. No
writer of authority can be quoted in favour of it, although Walker (§
18) and Wilson and Tucker (5th ed., 1910, § 53) state it. Westlake (vol.
I. p. 187) cannot be cited in favour of it, since he distinguishes
between bays and gulfs in such a way as is not generally done by
international lawyers, and as is certainly not recognised by geography;
for the very examples which he enumerates as <i>gulfs</i> are all called
<i>bays</i>, namely those of Conception, of Cancale, of Chesapeake, and of
Delaware. In the North Atlantic Coast Fisheries case, between the United
States and Great Britain, which was decided by the Permanent Court of
Arbitration at the Hague in 1910, the United States—see the official
publication of the case, p. 136—also contended that only such bays
could be considered territorial as possessed an entrance not wider than
six miles, but the Court refused to agree to this contention.</p></div>
<p>Some writers maintain that gulfs and bays whose
entrance is wider than ten miles, or three and a third
marine leagues, cannot belong to the territory of the
littoral State, and the practice of some States accords
with this opinion. But the practice of other countries,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
approved by many writers, goes beyond this limit.
Thus Great Britain holds the Bay of Conception in
Newfoundland to be territorial, although it goes forty
miles into the land and has an entrance more than
twenty miles wide. And the United States claim the
Chesapeake and Delaware Bays, as well as other inlets
of the same character, as territorial,<a id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_347_347">[347]</a> although many
European writers oppose this claim. The Institute of
International Law has voted in favour of a twelve miles
wide entrance, but admits the territorial character of
such gulfs and bays with a wider entrance as have been
considered territorial for more than one hundred years.<a id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_348_348">[348]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_347_347"></a><a href="#FNanchor_347_347" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[347]</span></a> See

 Annuaire, XIII. p. 329.</p></div>
<p>As the matter stands, it is doubtful as regards many
gulfs and bays whether they are territorial or not.
Examples of territorial bays in Europe are: The Zuider
Zee is Dutch; the Frische Haff, the Kurische Haff, and
the Bay of Stettin, in the Baltic, are German, as is also
the Jade Bay in the North Sea. The whole matter
calls for an international congress to settle the question
once for all which gulfs and bays are to be considered
territorial. And it must be specially observed that it
is hardly possible that Great Britain would still, as she
formerly did for centuries, claim the territorial character
of the so-called King's Chambers,<a id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_349_349">[349]</a> which include
portions of the sea between lines drawn from headland
to headland.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_349_349"></a><a href="#FNanchor_349_349" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[349]</span></a> Whereas Hall (§ 41, p. 162) says: "England would, no doubt,
not attempt any longer to assert a right of property over the King's
Chambers," Phillimore (I. § 200) still keeps up this claim. The attitude
of the British Government in the Moray Firth Case—see
 below, p. <a href="#Page_264" class="pginternal">264</a>—would seem to demonstrate that this claim is no longer upheld. See
also Lawrence, § 87, and Westlake, I. p. 188.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Non-territorial Gulfs and Bays.</p></div>
<p>§ 192. <a id="Gulfs_and_bays192"></a>Gulfs and bays surrounded by the land of
one and the same littoral State whose entrance is so
wide that it cannot be commanded by coast batteries,
and, further, all gulfs and bays enclosed by the land of

entrance may be, are non-territorial. They are parts
of the Open Sea, the marginal belt inside the gulfs and
bays excepted. They can never be appropriated, they
are in time of peace and war open to vessels of all
nations including men-of-war, and foreign fishing vessels
cannot, therefore, be compelled to comply with municipal
regulations of the littoral State concerning the
mode of fishing.</p>
<p>An illustrative case is that of the fisheries in the
Moray Firth. By article 6 of the Herring<a id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_350_350">[350]</a> Fishery
(Scotland) Act, 1889, beam and otter trawling is prohibited
within certain limits of the Scotch coast, and
the Moray Firth inside a line drawn from Duncansby
Head in Caithness to Rattray Point in Aberdeenshire
is included in the prohibited area. In 1905, Mortensen,
the captain of a Norwegian fishing vessel, but a Danish
subject, was prosecuted for an offence against the above-mentioned
article 6, convicted, and fined by the Sheriff
Court at Dornoch, although he contended that the
incriminating act was committed outside three miles
from the coast. He appealed to the High Court of
Justiciary, which,<a id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_351_351">[351]</a> however, confirmed the verdict of
the Sheriff Court, correctly asserting that, whether or
not the Moray Firth could be considered as a British
territorial bay, the Court was bound by a British Act
of Parliament even if such Act violates a rule of International
Law. The British Government, while recognising
that the Scotch Courts were bound by the Act of
Parliament concerned, likewise recognised that, the
Moray Firth not being a British territorial bay, foreign
fishing vessels could not be compelled to comply with
an Act of Parliament regulating the mode of fishing in
the Moray Firth outside three miles from the coast,
and therefore remitted Mortensen's fine. To remedy the
conflict between article 6 of the above-mentioned Herring<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
Fishery (Scotland) Act, 1889, and the requirements of
International Law, Parliament passed the Trawling in

<p>§ 193. As regards navigation and fishery within
territorial gulfs and bays, the same rules of the Law of

within the territorial maritime belt. The right of fishery
may, therefore, exclusively be reserved for subjects of

Denmark, France, Germany, and Holland reserves by its article 2 the
fishery for subjects of the littoral States of such bays as have an
entrance from the sea not wider than ten miles, but reserves likewise a
maritime belt of three miles to be measured from the line where the
entrance is ten miles wide. Practically the fishery is therefore
reserved for subjects of the littoral State within bays with an entrance
thirteen miles wide. See Martens, N.R.G. 2nd Ser. IX. (1884), p. 556.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What Straits are Territorial.</p></div>
<p>§ 194. <a id="All_straits194"></a>All straits which are so narrow as to be under
the command of coast batteries erected either on one
or both sides of the straits, are territorial. Therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
straits of this kind which divide the land of one and the
same State belong to the territory of such State. Thus
the Solent, which divides the Isle of Wight from England,
is British, the Dardanelles and the Bosphorus are
Turkish, and both the Kara and the Yugor Straits,
which connect the Kara Sea with the Barents Sea, are
Russian. On the other hand, if such narrow strait
divides the land of two different States, it belongs to
the territory of both, the boundary line running, failing
a special treaty making another arrangement, through
the mid-channel.<a id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_355_355">[355]</a> Thus the Lymoon Pass, the narrow
strait which separates the British island of Hong Kong
from the continent, was half British and half Chinese
as long as the land opposite Hong Kong was Chinese
territory.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_355_355"></a><a href="#FNanchor_355_355" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[355]</span></a> See
 below, § <a href="#Natural_boundaries199" class="pginternal">199</a>.</p></div>
<p>It would seem that claims of States over wider
straits than those which can be commanded by guns
from coast batteries are no longer upheld. Thus Great
Britain used formerly to claim the Narrow Seas—namely,
the St. George's Channel, the Bristol Channel,
the Irish Sea, and the North Channel—as territorial;
and Phillimore asserts that the exclusive right of Great
Britain over these Narrow Seas is uncontested. But
it must be emphasised that this right <i>is</i> contested, and
I believe that Great Britain would now no longer uphold
her former claim,<a id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_356_356">[356]</a> at least the Territorial Waters
Jurisdiction Act 1878 does not mention it.</p>

 Phillimore, I. § 189, and
 above, § <a href="#It_is_generally_admitted191" class="pginternal">191</a> (King's
Chambers). Concerning the Bristol Channel, Hall (§ 41, p. 162, note 2)
remarks: "It was apparently decided by the Queen's Bench in Reg. <i>v.</i>
Cunningham (Bell's "Crown Cases," 86) that the whole of the Bristol
Channel between Somerset and Glamorgan is British territory; possibly,
however, the Court intended to refer only to that portion of the Channel
which lies within Steepholm and Flatholm." See also Westlake, I. p. 188,
note 3.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Navigation, Fishery, and Jurisdiction in Straits.</p></div>
<p>§ 195. <a id="All195"></a>All rules of the Law of Nations concerning

cannot<a id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_357_357">[357]</a> be excluded; foreign men-of-war must be
admitted to such straits as form part of the highways
for international traffic;<a id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_358_358">[358]</a> the right of fishery may exclusively
be reserved for subjects of the littoral State;
and the latter can exercise jurisdiction over all foreign
merchantmen passing through the straits. If the narrow
strait divides the land of two different States, jurisdiction
and fishery are reserved for each littoral State
within the boundary line running through the mid-channel
or otherwise as by treaty arranged.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_357_357"></a><a href="#FNanchor_357_357" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[357]</span></a> The claim of Russia—see
 Waultrin in R.G. XV. (1908), p.
410—to have a right to exclude foreign merchantmen from the passage
through the Kara and the Yugor Straits, is therefore unfounded. As
regards the Kara Sea, see
 below, § <a href="#It_is_not_necessary253" class="pginternal">253</a>, note 2.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_358_358"></a><a href="#FNanchor_358_358" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[358]</span></a> As, for instance, the Straits of Magellan. These straits

<p>It must, however, be stated that foreign merchantmen
cannot be excluded from the passage through
territorial straits only when these connect two parts
of the Open Sea. In case a territorial strait belonging
to one and the same State connects a part of the
Open Sea with a territorial gulf or bay, or with a
territorial land-locked sea belonging to the same State—as,
for instance, the Strait of Kertch<a id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_359_359">[359]</a> at present, and
formerly the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles<a id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_360_360">[360]</a>—foreign

<div class="sidenote"><p>The former Sound Dues.</p></div>
<p>§ 196. The rule that foreign merchantmen must be
allowed inoffensive passage through territorial straits
without any dues and tolls whatever, had one exception
until the year 1857. From time immemorial,
Denmark had not allowed foreign vessels the passage
through the two Belts and the Sound, a narrow strait
which divides Denmark from Sweden and connects the
Kattegat with the Baltic, without payment of a toll,
the so-called Sound Dues.<a id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_361_361">[361]</a> Whereas in former centuries<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
these dues were not opposed, they were not considered
any longer admissible as soon as the principle
of free navigation on the sea became generally recognised,
but Denmark nevertheless insisted upon the dues.
In 1857, however, an arrangement<a id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_362_362">[362]</a> was completed between
the maritime Powers of Europe and Denmark by
which the Sound Dues were abolished against a heavy
indemnity paid by the signatory States to Denmark.
And in the same year the United States entered into
a convention<a id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_363_363">[363]</a> with Denmark for the free passage of
their vessels, and likewise paid an indemnity. With
these dues has disappeared the last witness of former
times when free navigation on the sea was not universally
recognised.</p>

<p>§ 197. <a id="Th197"></a>The Bosphorus and Dardanelles, the two
Turkish territorial straits which connect the Black Sea
with the Mediterranean, must be specially mentioned.<a id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_364_364">[364]</a>
So long as the Black Sea was entirely enclosed by
Turkish territory and was therefore a portion of this
territory, Turkey could exclude<a id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_365_365">[365]</a> foreign vessels from
the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles altogether, unless
prevented by special treaties. But when in the eighteenth
century Russia became a littoral State of the Black
Sea, and the latter, therefore, ceased to be entirely a
territorial sea, Turkey, by several treaties with foreign
Powers, conceded free navigation through the Bosphorus
and the Dardanelles to foreign merchantmen. But she
always upheld the rule that foreign men-of-war should
be excluded from these straits. And by article 1 of
the Convention of London of July 10, 1841, between
Turkey, Great Britain, Austria, France, Prussia, and
Russia, this rule was once for all accepted. Article 10
of the Peace Treaty of Paris of 1856 and the Convention<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
No. 1 annexed to this treaty, and, further, article 2
of the Treaty of London, 1871, again confirm the rule,
and all those Powers which were not parties to these
treaties submit nevertheless to it.<a id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_366_366">[366]</a> According to the
Treaty of London of 1871, however, the Porte can open
the straits in time of peace to the men-of-war of friendly
and allied Powers for the purpose, if necessary, of
securing the execution of the stipulations of the Peace
Treaty of Paris of 1856.</p>

Convention of London, to which she is not a party. See Wharton, I. § 29,
pp. 79 and 80, and Moore, I. § 134, pp. 666-668.</p></div>
<p>On the whole, the rule has in practice always been
upheld by Turkey. Foreign light public vessels in the
service of foreign diplomatic envoys at Constantinople
can be admitted by the provisions of the Peace Treaty
of Paris of 1856. And on several occasions when Turkey
has admitted a foreign man-of-war carrying a foreign
monarch on a visit to Constantinople, there has been
no opposition by the Powers.<a id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_367_367">[367]</a> But when, in 1902,
Turkey allowed four Russian torpedo destroyers to pass
through her straits on the condition that these vessels
should be disarmed and sail under the Russian commercial
flag, Great Britain protested and declared that
she reserved the right to demand similar privileges for
her men-of-war should occasion arise. As far as I
know, however, no other Power has joined Great Britain
in this protest. On the other hand, no protest was
raised when, in 1904, during the Russo-Japanese war,
two vessels belonging to the Russian volunteer fleet in
the Black Sea were allowed to pass through to the
Mediterranean, for nobody could presume that these
vessels, which were flying the Russian commercial flag,
would later on convert themselves into men-of-war by
hoisting the Russian war flag.<a id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_368_368">[368]</a></p>

course of the boundary lines may or may not be indicated
by boundary signs. These signs may be natural
or artificial, and one speaks, therefore, of natural in
contradistinction to artificial boundaries. <i>Natural</i> boundaries
may consist of water, a range of rocks or mountains,
deserts, forests, and the like. <i>Artificial</i> boundaries
are such signs as have been purposely put up to indicate
the way of the imaginary boundary-line. They may
consist of posts, stones, bars, walls,<a id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_369_369">[369]</a> trenches, roads,
canals, buoys in water, and the like. It must, however,
be borne in mind that the distinction between artificial
and natural boundaries is not sharp, in so far as some
natural boundaries can be artificially created. Thus a
forest may be planted, and a desert may be created, as
was the frequent practice of the Romans of antiquity,
for the purpose of marking the frontier.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_369_369"></a><a href="#FNanchor_369_369" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[369]</span></a> The Romans of antiquity very often constructed boundary
walls, and the Chinese Wall may also be cited as an example.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Boundary Waters.</p></div>
<p>§ 199. <a id="Natural_boundaries199"></a>Natural boundaries consisting of water must
be specially discussed on account of the different kinds
of boundary waters. Such kinds are rivers, lakes, landlocked
seas, and the maritime belt.</p>
<p>(1) Boundary rivers<a id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_370_370">[370]</a> are such rivers as separate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
two different States from each other.<a id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_371_371">[371]</a> If such river is
not navigable, the imaginary boundary line runs down
the middle of the river, following all turnings of the
border line of both banks of the river. On the other
hand, in a navigable river the boundary line runs
through the middle of the so-called <i>Thalweg</i>, that is,
the mid-channel of the river. It is, thirdly, possible
that the boundary line is the <i>border line</i> of the river, so
that the whole bed belongs to one of the riparian States
only.<a id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_372_372">[372]</a> But this is an exception created by treaty or
by the fact that a State has occupied the lands on one
side of a river at a time prior to the occupation of the
lands on the other side by some other State.<a id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_373_373">[373]</a> And
it must be remembered that, since a river sometimes
changes its course more or less, the boundary line running
through the middle or the <i>Thalweg</i> or along the
border line is thereby also altered. In case a bridge is
built over a boundary river, the boundary line runs, failing
special treaty arrangements, through the middle of the
bridge. As regards the boundary lines running through
islands rising in boundary rivers and through the abandoned
beds of such rivers, see

<p>(2) Boundary lakes and land-locked seas are such as
separate the lands of two or more different States from
each other. The boundary line runs through the middle
of these lakes and seas, but as a rule special treaties
portion off such lakes and seas between riparian States.<a id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_374_374">[374]</a></p>

to details given above (§ 186), uncertain, since no

league, from the low-water mark.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p>

<p>§ 200. Boundary mountains or hills are such natural
elevations from the common level of the ground as
separate the territories of two or more States from each
other. Failing special treaty arrangements, the boundary
line runs on the mountain ridge along with the
watershed. But it is quite possible that boundary
mountains belong wholly to one of the States which
they separate.<a id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_376_376">[376]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Boundary Disputes.</p></div>
<p>§ 201. Boundary lines are, for many reasons, of such
vital importance that disputes relating thereto are inevitably
very frequent and have often led to war.
During the nineteenth century, however, a tendency
began to prevail to settle such disputes peaceably. The
simplest way in which this can be done is always by
a boundary treaty, provided the parties can come to
terms.<a id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_377_377">[377]</a> In other cases arbitration can settle the matter,
as, for instance, in the Alaska Boundary dispute between
Great Britain (representing Canada) and the United
States, settled in 1903. Sometimes International Commissions
are specially appointed to settle the boundary
lines. In this way the boundary lines between Turkey,
Bulgaria, Servia, Montenegro, and Roumania were
settled after the Berlin Congress of 1878. It sometimes
happens that the States concerned, instead of settling
the boundary line, keep a strip of land between their
territories under their joint tenure and administration,
so that a so-called <i>condominium</i> comes into existence,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
as in the case of Moresnet (Kelmis) on the Prusso-Belgian
frontier.<a id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_378_378">[378]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_377_377"></a><a href="#FNanchor_377_377" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[377]</span></a> A good example of such a boundary treaty is that between
Great Britain and the United States of America respecting the
demarcation of the international boundary between the United States and
the Dominion of Canada, signed at Washington on April 11, 1908. See
Martens, N.R.G. 3rd Ser. IV. (1911), p. 191.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Natural Boundaries <i>sensu politico</i>.</p></div>
<p>§ 202. Whereas the term "natural boundaries" in
the theory and practice of the Law of Nations means
natural signs which indicate the course of boundary
lines, the same term is used politically<a id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_379_379">[379]</a> in various different
meanings. Thus the French often speak of the
river Rhine as their "natural" boundary, as the Italians
do of the Alps. Thus, further, the zones within which
the language of a nation is spoken are frequently termed
that nation's "natural" boundary. Again, the line
enclosing such parts of the land as afford great facilities
for defence against an attack is often called the
"natural" boundary of a State, whether or not these
parts belong to the territory of the respective State.
It is obvious that all these and other meanings of
the term "natural boundaries" are of no importance
to the Law of Nations, whatever value they may have
politically.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Conception of State Servitudes.</p></div>
<p>§ 203. <a id="State_servitudes203"></a>State servitudes are those exceptional and
conventional restrictions on the territorial supremacy
of a State by which a part or the whole of its territory<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
is in a limited way made perpetually to serve a certain
purpose or interest of another State. Thus a State
may by a convention be obliged to allow the passage
of troops of a neighbouring State, or may in the interest
of a neighbouring State be prevented from fortifying a
certain town near the frontier.</p>
<p>Servitudes must not be confounded<a id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_380_380">[380]</a> with those
general restrictions upon territorial supremacy which,
according to certain rules of the Law of Nations, concern
all States alike. These restrictions are named
"natural" restrictions of territorial supremacy (<i>servitutes
juris gentium naturales</i>), in contradistinction to the
conventional restrictions (<i>servitutes juris gentium voluntariae</i>)
which constitute the State servitudes in the
technical sense of the term. Thus, for instance, it is
not a State servitude, but a "natural" restriction on
territorial supremacy, that a State is obliged to admit
the free passage of foreign merchantmen through its
territorial maritime belt.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_380_380"></a><a href="#FNanchor_380_380" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[380]</span></a> This is done, for instance, by Heffter (§ 43), Martens (§
94), Nys (II. p. 271), and Hall (§ 42*); the latter speaks of the right
of innocent use of territorial seas as a servitude.</p></div>
<p>That State servitudes are or may on occasions be of
great importance, there can be no doubt whatever.
The vast majority<a id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_381_381">[381]</a> of writers and the practice of the
States accept, therefore, the conception of State servitudes,
although they do not agree with regard to the
definition and the width of the conception, and although,
consequently, in many cases the question is
disputed whether a certain restriction upon territorial
supremacy is or is not a State servitude.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_381_381"></a><a href="#FNanchor_381_381" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[381]</span></a> The conception of State servitudes
is rejected by Bulmerincq (§
49), Gareis (§ 71), Liszt (§§ 8 and 19),
Jellinek ("Allgemeine Staatslehre,"
p. 366).</p></div>
<p>The theory of State servitudes has of late been
rejected by the Permanent Court of Arbitration at
the Hague in the case<a id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_382_382">[382]</a> (1910) of the North Atlantic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
Coast Fisheries between Great Britain and the United
States, chiefly for the three reasons that a servitude in
International Law predicated an express grant of a
sovereign right, that the doctrine of international servitude
originated in the peculiar and now obsolete conditions
prevailing in the Holy Roman Empire, and that
this doctrine, being little suited to the principle of
sovereignty which prevails in States under a constitutional
government and to the present international
relations of Sovereign States, had found little, if any,
support from modern publicists. It is hardly to be expected
that this opinion of the Court will induce theory
and practice to drop the conception of State servitudes,
which is of great value because it fitly covers those
restrictions on the territorial supremacy of the State
by which a part or the whole of its territory is in a
limited way made perpetually to serve a certain purpose
or interest of another State. That the doctrine of
State servitudes originated in the peculiar conditions of
the Holy Roman Empire does not make it unfit for the
conditions of modern life if its practical value can be
demonstrated. Further, the assertion that the doctrine
is but little suited to the principle of sovereignty which
prevails in States under a constitutional government,
and has, therefore, found little, if any, support from
modern publicists, does not agree with the facts.
Lastly, the statement that a servitude in International
Law predicated an express grant of a sovereign right,
is not based on any other authority than the contention
of the United States, which made this unfounded
statement in presenting their case before the Tribunal.
The fact is that a State servitude, although to a certain
degree it restricts the sovereignty (territorial supremacy)
of the State concerned, does as little as any
other restriction upon the sovereignty of a State confer
a sovereign right upon the State in favour of which
it is established.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Subjects of State Servitudes.</p></div>
<p>§ 204. Subjects of State servitudes are States only
and exclusively, since State servitudes can exist between
States only (<i>territorium dominans</i> and <i>territorium
serviens</i>). Formerly some writers<a id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_383_383">[383]</a> maintained that
private individuals and corporations were able to
acquire a State servitude; but nowadays it is agreed
that this is not possible, since the Law of Nations is a
law between States only and exclusively. Whatever
rights may be granted by a State to foreign individuals
and corporations, such rights can never constitute State
servitudes.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_383_383"></a><a href="#FNanchor_383_383" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[383]</span></a> Bluntschli, § 353; Heffter, § 44.</p></div>
<p>On the other hand, every State can acquire and
grant State servitudes, although some States may, in
consequence of their particular position within the
Family of Nations, be prevented from acquiring or
granting some special kind or another of State servitudes.
Thus neutralised States are in many points
hampered in regard to acquiring and granting State
servitudes, because they have to avoid everything that
could drag them indirectly into war. Thus, further,
half-Sovereign and part-Sovereign States may not be
able to acquire and to grant certain State servitudes on
account of their dependence upon their superior State.
But apart from such exceptional cases, even not-full
Sovereign States can acquire and grant State servitudes,
provided they have any international status at all.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Object of State Servitudes.</p></div>
<p>§ 205. The object of State servitudes is always the
whole or a part of the territory of the State the territorial
supremacy of which is restricted by any such
servitude.<a id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_384_384">[384]</a> Since the territory of a State includes not
only the land but also the rivers which water the land,
the maritime belt, the territorial subsoil, and the territorial<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
atmosphere, all these can, as well as the service
of the land itself, be an object of State servitudes.
Thus a State may have a perpetual right of admittance
for its subjects to the fishery in the maritime belt of
another State, or a right to lay telegraph cables through
a foreign maritime belt, or a right to make and use a
tunnel through a boundary mountain, and the like.
And should ever aërostation become so developed as
to be of practical utility, a State servitude might be
created through a State acquiring a perpetual right to
send military aerial vehicles through the territorial
atmosphere of a neighbouring State. It must, however,
be emphasised that the Open Sea can never be the
object of a State servitude, since it is no State's
territory.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_384_384"></a><a href="#FNanchor_384_384" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[384]</span></a> The contention of the United States, adopted by the Hague
Arbitration Tribunal, in 1910, in the case of the North Atlantic Coast
Fisheries, that a State servitude conferred a sovereign right upon the
State in favour of which it is established, was refuted
 above in § <a href="#State_servitudes203" class="pginternal">203</a>,
p. 275.</p></div>
<p>Since the object of State servitudes is the territory
of a State, all such restrictions upon the territorial
supremacy of a State as do not make a part or the
whole of its territory itself serve a purpose or an interest
of another State are not State servitudes. The territory
as the object is the mark of distinction between
State servitudes and other restrictions on the territorial
supremacy. Thus the perpetual restriction imposed
upon a State by a treaty not to keep an army beyond
a certain size is certainly a restriction on territorial
supremacy, but is not, as some writers<a id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_385_385">[385]</a> maintain, a
State servitude, because it does not make the territory
of one State serve an interest of another. On the other
hand, when a State submits to a perpetual right enjoyed
by another State of passage of troops, or to the duty
not to fortify a certain town, place, or island,<a id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_386_386">[386]</a> or to the
claim of another State for its subjects to be allowed the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
fishery within the former's territorial belt;<a id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_387_387">[387]</a> in all these
and the like<a id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_388_388">[388]</a> cases the territorial supremacy of a State
<i>is</i> in such a way restricted that a part or the whole of
its territory is made to serve the interest of another
State, and such restrictions are therefore State servitudes.<a id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_389_389">[389]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_385_385"></a><a href="#FNanchor_385_385" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[385]</span></a> See,

</p><p>
(<i>a</i>) The former French fishery rights in Newfoundland which were based
on article 13 of the Treaty of Utrecht, 1713, and on the Treaty of
Versailles, 1783. See the details regarding the Newfoundland Fishery
Dispute, in Phillimore, I. § 195; Clauss, pp. 17-31; Geffcken in R.I.
XXII. p. 217; Brodhurst in <i>Law Magazine and Review</i>, XXIV. p. 67. The
French literature on the question is quoted in Bonfils, No. 342, note 1.
The dispute is now settled by France's renunciation of the privileges
due to her according to article 13 of the Treaty of Utrecht, which took
place by article 1 of the Anglo-French Convention signed in London on
April 8, 1904 (see Martens, N.R.G. 2nd Ser. XXXII. (1905), p. 29). But
France retains, according to article 2 of the latter Convention, the
right of fishing for her subjects in certain parts of the territorial
waters of Newfoundland.
</p><p>
(<i>b</i>) The fishery rights granted by Great Britain to the United States
of America in certain parts of the British North Atlantic Coast by
article 1 of the Treaty of 1818 which gave rise to disputes extending
over a long period. The dispute is now settled by an award of the Hague
Permanent Court of Arbitration given in September (1910). That the Court
refused to recognise the conception of State servitudes, was pointed out
above, § <a href="#State_servitudes203" class="pginternal">203</a>. See
 above, § <a href="#State_servitudes203" class="pginternal">203</a>, and the literature there quoted.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_388_388"></a><a href="#FNanchor_388_388" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[388]</span></a> Phillimore (I. § 283) quotes two interesting State
servitudes which belong to the past. According to articles 4 and 10 of
the Treaty of Utrecht, 1713, France was, in the interest of Great
Britain, not to allow the Stuart Pretender to reside on French
territory, and Great Britain was, in the interest of Spain, not to allow
Moors and Jews to reside in Gibraltar.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_389_389"></a><a href="#FNanchor_389_389" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[389]</span></a> The controverted question whether neutralisation of a State
creates a State servitude is answered by Clauss (p. 167) in the
affirmative, but by Ullmann (§ 99), correctly, I think, in the negative.
But a distinction must be drawn between neutralisation of a whole State
and neutralisation of certain parts of a State. In the latter case a
State servitude is indeed created.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Different kinds of State Servitudes.</p></div>
<p>§ 206. According to different qualities different kinds
of State servitudes must be distinguished.</p>
<p>(1) Affirmative, active, or positive, are those servitudes
which give the right to a State to perform certain
acts on the territory of another State, such as to build
and work a railway, to establish a custom-house, to
let an armed force pass through a certain territory
(<i>droit d'étape</i>), or to keep troops in a certain fortress,
to use a port or an island as a coaling station, and
the like.</p>
<p>(2) Negative, are such servitudes as give a right to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
a State to demand of another State that the latter shall
abstain from exercising its territorial supremacy in
certain ways. Thus a State can have a right to demand
that a neighbouring State shall not fortify certain towns
near the frontier, that another State shall not allow
foreign men-of-war in a certain harbour.<a id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_390_390">[390]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_390_390"></a><a href="#FNanchor_390_390" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[390]</span></a> Affirmative State servitudes consist <i>in patiendo</i>,
negative servitudes <i>in non faciendo</i>. The rule of Roman Law <i>servitus
in faciendo consistere nequit</i> has been adopted by the Law of Nations.</p></div>
<p>(3) Military, are those State servitudes which are
acquired for military purposes, such as the right to keep
troops in a foreign fortress, or to let an armed force pass
through foreign territory, or to demand that a town on
foreign territory shall not be fortified, and the like.</p>
<p>(4) Economic, are those servitudes which are acquired
for the purpose of commercial interests, traffic,
and intercourse in general, such as the right of fisheries
in foreign territorial waters, to build a railway on or
lay a telegraph cable through foreign territory, and the
like.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Validity of State Servitudes.</p></div>
<p>§ 207. <a id="Si207"></a>Since State servitudes, in contradistinction to
personal rights (rights <i>in personam</i>), are rights inherent
to the object with which they are connected (rights
<i>in rem</i>), they remain valid and may be exercised however
the ownership of the territory to which they apply
may change. Therefore, if, after the creation of a State
servitude, the part of the territory affected comes by
subjugation or cession under the territorial supremacy
of another State, such servitude remains in force. Thus,
when the Alsatian town of Hüningen became in 1871,
together with the whole of Alsace, German territory,
the State servitude created by the Treaty of Paris, 1815,
that Hüningen should, in the interest of the Swiss canton
of Basle, never be fortified, was not extinguished.<a id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_391_391">[391]</a>
Thus, further, when in 1860 the former Sardinian provinces
of Chablais and Faucigny became French, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
State servitude created by article 92 of the Act of the
Vienna Congress, 1815, that Switzerland should have
temporarily during war the right to locate troops in
these provinces, was not extinguished.<a id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_392_392">[392]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_391_391"></a><a href="#FNanchor_391_391" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[391]</span></a> Details in Clauss, pp. 15-17.</p></div>

<p>It is a moot point whether military State servitudes
can be exercised in time of war by a belligerent if the
State with whose territory they are connected remains
neutral. Must such State, for the purpose of upholding
its neutrality, prevent the belligerent from exercising
the respective servitude—for instance, the right of
passage of troops?<a id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_393_393">[393]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_393_393"></a><a href="#FNanchor_393_393" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[393]</span></a> This question became practical when in 1900, during the
South African war, Great Britain claimed, and Portugal was ready to
grant, passage of troops through Portuguese territory in South Africa.

<div class="sidenote"><p>Extinction of State Servitudes.</p></div>
<p>§ 208. State servitudes are extinguished by agreement
between the States concerned, or by express or
tacit<a id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_394_394">[394]</a> renunciation on the part of the State in whose
interest they were created. They are not, according to
the correct opinion, extinguished by reason of the
territory involved coming under the territorial supremacy
of another State. But it is difficult to understand
why, although State servitudes are called into
existence through treaties, it is sometimes maintained
that the clause <i>rebus sic stantibus</i><a id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_395_395">[395]</a> cannot be applied
in case a vital change of circumstances makes the exercise
of a State servitude unbearable. It is a matter of
course that in such case the restricted State must previously
try to come to terms with the State which is
the subject of the servitude. But if an agreement cannot
be arrived at on account of the unreasonableness of the
other party, the clause <i>rebus sic stantibus</i> may well be
resorted to.<a id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_396_396">[396]</a> The fact that the practice of the States
does not provide any example of an appeal to this clause<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
for the purpose of doing away with a State servitude
proves only that such appeal has hitherto been unnecessary.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Who can acquire State Territory?</p></div>
<p>§ 209. <a id="Since_States_only209"></a>Since States only and exclusively are subjects
of the Law of Nations, it is obvious that, as far as
the Law of Nations is concerned, States<a id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_397_397">[397]</a> solely can
acquire State territory. But the acquisition of territory
by an existing State and member of the Family of
Nations must not be confounded, first, with the foundation
of a new State, and, secondly, with the acquisition
of such territory and sovereignty over it by private
individuals or corporations as lies outside the dominion
of the Law of Nations.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_397_397"></a><a href="#FNanchor_397_397" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[397]</span></a> There is no doubt that no full-Sovereign State is, as a
rule, prevented by the Law of Nations from acquiring more territory than
it already owns, unless some treaty arrangement precludes it from so
doing. As regards the question whether a neutralised State is, by its
neutralisation, prevented from acquiring territory, see
 above, § <a href="#Without_thereby96" class="pginternal">96</a>, and
below, § <a href="#The_object_of_cession215" class="pginternal">215</a>.</p></div>
<p>(1) Whenever a multitude of individuals, living on
or entering into such a part of the surface of the globe
as does not belong to the territory of any member of
the Family of Nations, constitute themselves as a State
and nation on that part of the globe, a new State comes
into existence. This State is not, by reason of its birth,
a member of the Family of Nations. The formation of
a new State is, as will be remembered from former<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
statements,<a id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_398_398">[398]</a> a matter of fact, and not of law. It is
through recognition, which is a matter of law, that such
new State becomes a member of the Family of Nations
and a subject of International Law. As soon as recognition
is given, the new State's territory is recognised
as the territory of a subject of International Law, and
it matters not how this territory was acquired before
the recognition.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_398_398"></a><a href="#FNanchor_398_398" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[398]</span></a> See
 above, § <a href="#As_the_basis_of_the_Law71" class="pginternal">71</a>.</p></div>
<p>(2) <a id="Not_essentially_different2of209"></a>Not essentially different is the case in which a
private individual or a corporation acquires land with
sovereignty over it in countries which are not under the
territorial supremacy of a member of the Family of
Nations. The actual proceeding in all such cases is that
all such acquisition is made either by occupation of
hitherto uninhabited land, for instance an island, or
by cession from a native tribe living on the land. Acquisition
of territory and sovereignty thereon in such
cases takes place outside the dominion of the Law of
Nations, and the rules of this law, therefore, cannot
be applied. If the individual or corporation which has
made the acquisition requires protection by the Law of
Nations, they must either declare a new State to be
in existence and ask for its recognition by the Powers,
as in the case of the former Congo Free State,<a id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_399_399">[399]</a> or they
must ask a member of the Family of Nations to acknowledge
the acquisition as made on its behalf.<a id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_400_400">[400]</a></p>

acquired in 1841 Sarawak, in North Borneo, and established an
independent State there, of which he became the Sovereign, may also be
cited. Sarawak is under English protectorate, but the successor of Sir
James Brooke is still recognised as Sovereign.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_400_400"></a><a href="#FNanchor_400_400" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[400]</span></a> The matter is treated with great lucidity by Heimburger,
pp. 44-77, who defends the opinion represented in the text against Sir
Travers Twiss (I. Preface, p. x.; also in R.I. XV. p. 547, and XVI. p.
237) and other writers. See also Ullmann, § 93.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Former Doctrine concerning Acquisition of Territory.</p></div>
<p>§ 210. No unanimity exists among writers on the
Law of Nations with regard to the modes of acquiring
territory on the part of the members of the Family of
Nations. The topic owes its controversial character to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
the fact that the conception of State territory has undergone
a great change since the appearance of the science
of the Law of Nations. When Grotius created that
science, State territory used to be still, as in the Middle
Ages, more or less identified with the private property
of the monarch of the State. Grotius and his followers
applied, therefore, the rules of Roman Law concerning
the acquisition of private property to the acquisition of
territory by States.<a id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_401_401">[401]</a> As nowadays, as far as International
Law is concerned, every analogy to private
property has disappeared from the conception of State
territory, the acquisition of territory by a State can
mean nothing else than the acquisition of <i>sovereignty</i>
over such territory. It is obvious that under these
circumstances the rules of Roman Law concerning the
acquisition of private property can no longer be applied.
Yet the fact that they have been applied in the past
has left traces which can hardly be obliterated; and
they need not be obliterated, since they contain a good
deal of truth in agreement with the actual facts. But
the different modes of acquiring territory must be
taken from the real practice of the States, and not from
Roman Law, although the latter's terminology and
common-sense basis may be made use of.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_401_401"></a><a href="#FNanchor_401_401" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[401]</span></a> See
 above, § <a href="#State_territory_is_that168" class="pginternal">168</a>. The distinction between <i>imperium</i> and
<i>dominium</i> in Seneca's <i>dictum</i> that "omnia rex imperio possidet,
singuli dominio" was well known, and Grotius, II. c. 3, § 4, quotes it,
but the consequences thereof were nevertheless not deduced. (See
Westlake, Chapters, pp. 129-133, and Westlake, I. pp. 84-88.)</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>What Modes of Acquisition of Territory there are.</p></div>
<p>§ 211. States as living organisms grow and decrease
in territory. If the historical facts are taken into consideration,
different reasons may be found to account
for the exercise of sovereignty by a State over the
different sections of its territory. One section may
have been ceded by another State, another section may
have come into the possession of the owner in consequence
of accretion, a third through subjugation, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
fourth through occupation of no State's land. As regards
a fifth section, a State may say that it has exercised
its sovereignty over the same for so long a period
that the fact of having had it in undisturbed possession
is a sufficient title of ownership. Accordingly, five
modes of acquiring territory may be distinguished,
namely: cession, occupation, accretion, subjugation,
and prescription. Most writers recognise these five
modes. Some, however, do not recognise prescription;
some assert that accretion creates nothing else than a
modification of the territory of a State; and some do
not recognise subjugation at all, or declare it to be only
a special case of occupation. It is for these reasons that
some writers recognise only two or three<a id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_402_402">[402]</a> modes of
acquiring territory. Be that as it may, all modes,
besides the five mentioned, enumerated by some writers,
are in fact not special modes, but only special cases of
cession.<a id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_403_403">[403]</a> And whatever may be the value of the
opinions of publicists, so much is certain that the
practice of the States recognises cession, occupation,
accretion, subjugation, and prescription as distinct
modes of acquiring territory.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_402_402"></a><a href="#FNanchor_402_402" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[402]</span></a> Thus Gareis (§ 70) recognises cession and occupation only,
whereas Heimburger (pp. 106-110) and Holtzendorff (II. p. 254) recognise
cession, occupation, and accretion only.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_403_403"></a><a href="#FNanchor_403_403" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[403]</span></a> See
 below, § <a href="#The_only_form216" class="pginternal">216</a>. Such alleged special modes are sale,
exchange, gift, marriage contract, testamentary disposition, and the
like.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Original and derivative Modes of Acquisition.</p></div>
<p>§ 212. The modes of acquiring territory are correctly
divided according as the title they give is derived from
the title of a prior owner State, or not. Cession is therefore
a derivative mode of acquisition, whereas occupation,
accretion, subjugation, and prescription are original
modes.<a id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_404_404">[404]</a></p>

prescription besides cession as derivative modes. This is, however,
merely the consequence of a peculiar conception of what is called a
derivative mode of acquisition.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Conception of cession of State Territory.</p></div>
<p>§ 213. Cession of State territory is the transfer of
sovereignty over State territory by the owner State to
another State. There is no doubt whatever that such
cession is possible according to the Law of Nations, and
history presents innumerable examples of such transfer
of sovereignty. The Constitutional Law of the different
States may or may not lay down special rules<a id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_405_405">[405]</a> for the
transfer or acquisition of territory. Such rules can
have no direct influence upon the rules of the Law of
Nations concerning cession, since Municipal Law can
neither abolish existing nor create new rules of International
Law.<a id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_406_406">[406]</a> But if such municipal rules contain
constitutional restrictions on the Government with regard
to cession of territory, these restrictions are so far
important that such treaties of cession concluded by
heads of States or Governments as violate these restrictions
are not binding.<a id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_407_407">[407]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Subjects of cession.</p></div>
<p>§ 214. <a id="Since_cession_is214"></a>Since cession is a bilateral transaction, it has
two subjects—namely, the ceding and the acquiring
State. Both subjects must be States, and only those
cessions in which both subjects are States concern
the Law of Nations. Cessions of territory made to
private persons and to corporations<a id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_408_408">[408]</a> by native tribes
or by States outside the dominion of the Law of Nations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>

do cessions of territory by native tribes made to States<a id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_409_409">[409]</a>
which are members of the Family of Nations. On the
other hand, cession of territory made to a member of
the Family of Nations by a State as yet outside that
family is real cession and a concern of the Law of Nations,
since such State becomes through the treaty of cession
in some respects a member of that family.<a id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_410_410">[410]</a></p>

totally merge in another State. However, since certain
parts of State territory, as for instance rivers and the

they cannot be ceded without a piece of land.<a id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_411_411">[411]</a></p>

neutralised parts of a not permanently neutralised
State can be ceded to another State must be answered
in the affirmative,<a id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_412_412">[412]</a> although the Powers certainly can
exercise an intervention by right. On the other hand,
a permanently neutralised State could not, except in
the case of mere frontier regulation, cede a part of its
neutralised territory to another State without the consent
of the Powers.<a id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_413_413">[413]</a> Nor could a State under suzerainty
or protectorate cede a part or the whole of its territory
to a third State without the consent of the superior
State. Thus, the Ionian Islands could not in 1863 have
merged in Greece without the consent of Great Britain,
which exercised a protectorate over these islands.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_412_412"></a><a href="#FNanchor_412_412" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[412]</span></a> Thus in 1860 Sardinia ceded her neutralised provinces of
Chablais and Faucigny to France. See
 above, §207.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Form of cession.</p></div>
<p>§ 216. <a id="The_only_form216"></a>The only form in which a cession can be effected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
is an agreement embodied in a treaty between the ceding
and the acquiring State. Such treaty may be the outcome
of peaceable negotiations or of war, and the
cession may be one with or without compensation.</p>
<p>If a cession of territory is the outcome of war, it
is the treaty of peace which stipulates the cession
among its other provisions. Such cession is regularly
one without compensation, although certain duties may
be imposed upon the acquiring State, as, for instance,
of taking over a part of the debts of the ceding State
corresponding to the extent and importance of the
ceded territory, or that of giving the individuals domiciled
on the ceded territory the option to retain their
old citizenship or, at least, to emigrate.</p>
<p>Cessions which are the outcome of peaceable negotiations
may be agreed upon by the interested States from
different motives and for different purposes. Thus
Austria, during war with Prussia and Italy in 1866,
ceded Venice to France as a gift, and some weeks afterwards
France on her part ceded Venice to Italy. The
Duchy of Courland ceded in 1795 its whole territory to
and voluntarily merged thereby in Russia, in the same
way the then Free Town of Mulhouse merged in France
in 1798, the Congo Free State in Belgium in 1908, and
the Empire of Korea in Japan in 1911.</p>
<p>Cessions have in the past often been effected by
transactions which are analogous to transactions in
private business life. As long as absolutism was reigning
over Europe, it was not at all rare for territory to
be ceded in <i>marriage contracts</i> or by <i>testamentary dispositions</i>.<a id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_414_414">[414]</a>
In the interest of frontier regulations, but
also for other purposes, <i>exchanges</i> of territory frequently
take place. <i>Sale</i> of territory is quite usual; as late as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
1868 Russia sold her territory in America to the United
States for 7,200,000 dollars, and in 1899 Spain sold the
Caroline Islands to Germany for 25,000,000 pesetas.
<i>Pledge</i> and <i>lease</i> are also made use of. Thus, the then
Republic of Genoa pledged Corsica to France in 1768,
Sweden pledged Wismar to Mecklenburg in 1803; China<a id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_415_415">[415]</a>
leased in 1898 Kiaochau to Germany,<a id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_416_416">[416]</a> Wei-Hai-Wei
and the land opposite the island of Hong Kong to
Great Britain,<a id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_417_417">[417]</a> and Port Arthur to Russia.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_414_414"></a><a href="#FNanchor_414_414" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[414]</span></a> Phillimore, I. §§ 274-276, enumerates many examples of such
cession. The question whether the monarch of a State under absolute
government could nowadays by a testamentary disposition cede territory
to another State must, I believe, be answered in the affirmative.</p></div>

the disguise of an agreement according to which territory comes under
the "administration" or under the "use, occupation, and control" of a
foreign State. See
 above, § <a href="#The_second_case2of171" class="pginternal">171, Nos. 2</a>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Tradition of the ceded Territory.</p></div>
<p>§ 217. The treaty of cession must be followed by
actual tradition of the territory to the new owner State,
unless such territory is already occupied by the new
owner, as in the case where the cession is the outcome
of war and the ceded territory has been during such
war in the military occupation of the State to which
it is now ceded. But the validity of the cession does
not depend upon tradition,<a id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_419_419">[419]</a> the cession being completed
by ratification of the treaty of cession, and the capability
of the new owner to cede the acquired territory
to a third State at once without taking actual possession
of it.<a id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_420_420">[420]</a> But of course the new owner State cannot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
exercise its territorial supremacy thereon until it has
taken physical possession of the ceded territory.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_419_419"></a><a href="#FNanchor_419_419" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[419]</span></a> This is controversial. Many writers—see,
 for instance,
Rivier, I. p. 203—oppose the opinion presented in the text.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_420_420"></a><a href="#FNanchor_420_420" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[420]</span></a> Thus France, to which Austria ceded in 1859 Lombardy, ceded
this territory on her part to Sardinia without previously having
actually taken possession of it.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Veto of third Powers.</p></div>
<p>§ 218. As a rule, no third Power has the right of
<i>veto</i> with regard to a cession of territory. Exceptionally,
however, such right may exist. It may be that a
third Power has by a previous treaty acquired a right
of pre-emption concerning the ceded territory, or that
some early treaty has created another obstacle to the
cession, as, for instance, in the case of permanently
neutralised parts of a not-permanently neutralised
State.<a id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_421_421">[421]</a> And the Powers have certainly the right of
<i>veto</i> in case a permanently neutralised State desires to
increase its territory by acquiring land through cession
from another State.<a id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_422_422">[422]</a> But even where no right of <i>veto</i>
exists, a third Power might intervene for political reasons.
For there is no duty on the part of third States
to acquiesce in such cessions of territory as endanger
the balance of power or are otherwise of vital importance.<a id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_423_423">[423]</a>
And a strong State will practically always
interfere in case a cession of such a kind as menaces its
vital interests is agreed upon. Thus, when in 1867 the
reigning King of Holland proposed to sell Luxemburg
to France, the North German Confederation intervened,
and the cession was not effected, but Luxemburg became
permanently neutralised.</p>

and are handed over to a new Sovereign whether they

claim that no cession shall be valid until the inhabitants
have by a plebiscite<a id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_425_425">[425]</a> given their consent to the
cession. And several treaties<a id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_426_426">[426]</a> of cession concluded
during the nineteenth century stipulate that the cession
shall only be valid provided the inhabitants consent to
it through a plebiscite. But it is doubtful whether the

<p>The hardship of the inhabitants being handed over
to a new Sovereign against their will can be lessened
by a stipulation in the treaty of cession binding the
acquiring State to give the inhabitants of the ceded
territory the option of retaining their old citizenship
on making an express declaration. Many treaties of
cession concluded during the second half of the nineteenth
century contain this stipulation. But it must
be emphasised that, failing a stipulation expressly forbidding
it, the acquiring State may expel those inhabitants
who have made use of the option and retained
their old citizenship, since otherwise the whole population
of the ceded territory might actually consist of
aliens and endanger the safety of the acquiring State.</p>
<p>The option to emigrate within a certain period, which
is frequently stipulated in favour of the inhabitants of
ceded territory, is another means of averting the charge
that inhabitants are handed over to a new Sovereign
against their will. Thus article 2 of the Peace Treaty
of Frankfort, 1871, which ended the Franco-German
war, stipulated that the French inhabitants of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
ceded territory of Alsace and Lorraine should up to
October 1, 1872, enjoy the privilege of transferring
their domicile from the ceded territory to French soil.<a id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_428_428">[428]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_428_428"></a><a href="#FNanchor_428_428" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[428]</span></a> The important question whether subjects of the ceding
States who are born on the ceded territory but have their domicile
abroad become <i>ipso facto</i> by the cession subjects of the acquiring
State, must, I think, be answered in the negative, unless special treaty
arrangements stipulate the contrary. Therefore, Frenchmen born in Alsace
but domiciled at the time of the cession in Great Britain, would not
have lost their French citizenship through the cession to Germany but
for article 1, part 2, of the additional treaty of Dec. 11, 1871, to the
Peace Treaty of Frankfort. (Martens, N.R.G. XX. p. 847.) See Bonfils,
No. 427, and Cogordan, "La Nationalité, &amp;c." (1890), p. 361.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Conception of Occupation.</p></div>
<p>§ 220. Occupation is the act of appropriation by a
State through which it intentionally acquires sovereignty
over such territory as is at the time not under
the sovereignty of another State. Occupation as a mode
of acquisition differs from subjugation<a id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_429_429">[429]</a> chiefly in so
far as the conquered and afterwards annexed territory
has hitherto belonged to another State. Again, occupation
differs from cession in so far as through cession
the acquiring State receives sovereignty over the respective
territory from the former owner State. In contradistinction
to cession, which is a derivative mode of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
acquisition, occupation is therefore an original mode.
And it must be emphasised that occupation can only
take place by and for a State;<a id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_430_430">[430]</a> it must be a State act,
that is, it must be performed in the service of a State,
or it must be acknowledged by a State after its performance.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_429_429"></a><a href="#FNanchor_429_429" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[429]</span></a> See

<div class="sidenote"><p>Object of Occupation.</p></div>
<p>§ 221. <a id="Only_such_territory221"></a>Only such territory can be the object of
occupation as is no State's land, whether entirely uninhabited,
as <i>e.g.</i> an island, or inhabited by natives
whose community is not to be considered as a State.
Even civilised individuals may live and have private
property on a territory without any union by them into
a State proper which exercises sovereignty over such
territory. And natives may live on a territory under
a tribal organisation which need not be considered a
State proper. But a part or the whole of the territory
of any State, even although such State is entirely outside
the Family of Nations, is not a possible object of
occupation, and it can only be acquired through cession<a id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_431_431">[431]</a>
or subjugation. On the other hand, a territory which
belonged at one time to a State but has been afterwards
abandoned, is a possible object for occupation on the
part of another State.<a id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_432_432">[432]</a></p>

hoisted the flag of the United States the question was discussed whether
the North Pole could be the object of occupation. The question must, I
believe, be answered in the negative since there is no land on the Pole.

<div class="sidenote"><p>Occupation how effected.</p></div>
<p>§ 222. <a id="Theory_and_practice222"></a>Theory and practice agree nowadays upon the
rule that occupation is effected through taking possession
of and establishing an administration over the
territory in the name of and for the acquiring State.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
Occupation thus effected is <i>real</i> occupation, and, in
contradistinction to <i>fictitious</i> occupation, is named
<i>effective</i> occupation. Possession and administration
are the two essential facts that constitute an effective
occupation.</p>
<p>(1) The territory must really be taken into possession
by the occupying State. For this purpose it is necessary
that the respective State should take the territory
under its sway (<i>corpus</i>) with the intention to acquire
sovereignty over it (<i>animus</i>). This can only be done
by a settlement on the territory accompanied by some
formal act which announces both that the territory has
been taken possession of and that the possessor intends
to keep it under his sovereignty. The necessary formal
act is usually performed either by the publication of a
proclamation or by the hoisting of a flag. But such
formal act by itself constitutes fictitious occupation
only, unless there is left on the territory a settlement
which is able to keep up the authority of the flag. On
the other hand, it is irrelevant whether or not some
agreement is made with the natives by which they
submit themselves to the sway of the occupying State.
Any such agreement is usually neither understood nor
appreciated by them, and even if the natives really do
understand the meaning, such agreements have a moral
value only.<a id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_435_435">[435]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_435_435"></a><a href="#FNanchor_435_435" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[435]</span></a> If an agreement with natives were legally important, the
respective territory would be acquired by cession, and not by
occupation. But although it is nowadays quite usual to obtain a cession
from a native chief, this is, nevertheless, not cession in the technical
sense of the term in International Law; see
 above, § <a href="#Since_cession_is214" class="pginternal">214</a>.</p></div>
<p>(2) After having, in the aforementioned way, taken
possession of a territory, the possessor must establish
some kind of administration thereon which shows that
the territory is really governed by the new possessor.
If within a reasonable time after the act of taking
possession the possessor does not establish some responsible
authority which exercises governing functions,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
there is then no effective occupation, since in fact no
sovereignty of a State is exercised over the territory.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Inchoate Title of Discovery.</p></div>
<p>§ 223. In former times the two conditions of possession
and administration which now make the occupation
effective were not considered necessary for the acquisition
of territory through occupation. In the age of
the discoveries, States maintained that the fact of discovering
a hitherto unknown territory was sufficient
reason for considering it as acquired through occupation
by the State in whose service the discoverer made his
explorations. And although later on a real taking
possession of the territory was considered necessary for
its occupation, it was not until the eighteenth century
that the writers on the Law of Nations postulated an
<i>effective</i> occupation as necessary,<a id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_436_436">[436]</a> and it was not until
the nineteenth century that the practice of the States
accorded with this postulate. But although nowadays
discovery does not constitute acquisition through occupation,
it is nevertheless not without importance. It is
agreed that discovery gives to the State in whose service
it was made an <i>inchoate</i> title; it "acts as a temporary
bar to occupation by another State"<a id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_437_437">[437]</a> within such a
period as is reasonably sufficient for effectively occupying
the discovered territory. If such period lapses without
any attempt by the discovering State to turn its
<i>inchoate</i> title into a <i>real</i> title of occupation, such inchoate
title perishes, and any other State can now acquire the
territory by means of an effective occupation.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Notification of Occupation to other Powers.</p></div>
<p>§ 224. No rule of the Law of Nations exists which
makes notification of occupation to other Powers a
necessary condition of its validity. But as regards all
future occupations on the <i>African</i> coast the Powers
assembled at the Berlin Congo Conference in 1884-1885
have by article 34 of the General Act<a id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_438_438">[438]</a> of this Conference<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
stipulated that occupation shall be notified to one another,
so that such notification is now a condition of
the validity of certain occupations in Africa. And there
is no doubt that in time this rule will either by custom
or by treaty be extended from occupations on the
African coast to occupations everywhere else.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_438_438"></a><a href="#FNanchor_438_438" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[438]</span></a> See

<div class="sidenote"><p>Extent of Occupation.</p></div>
<p>§ 225. Since an occupation is valid only if effective,
it is obvious that the extent of an occupation ought
only to reach over so much territory as is effectively
occupied. In practice, however, the interested States
have neither in the past nor in the present acted in
conformity with such a rule; on the contrary, they
have always tried to attribute to their occupation a
much wider area. Thus it has been maintained that
an effective occupation of the land at the mouth of a
river is sufficient to bring under the sovereignty of the
occupying State the whole territory through which such
river and its tributaries run up to the very crest of the
watershed.<a id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_439_439">[439]</a> Again, it has been maintained that, when
a coast line has been effectively occupied, the extent
of the occupation reaches up to the watershed of all
such rivers as empty into the coast line.<a id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_440_440">[440]</a> And it has,
thirdly, been asserted that effective occupation of a
territory extends the sovereignty of the possessor also
over neighbouring territories as far as it is necessary
for the integrity, security, and defence of the really
occupied land.<a id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_441_441">[441]</a> But all these and other fanciful assertions
have no basis to rest upon. In truth, no general
rule can be laid down beyond the above, that occupation
reaches as far as it is effective. How far it is
effective is a question of the special case. It is obvious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
that when the agent of a State takes possession of a
territory and makes a settlement on a certain spot of
it, he intends thereby to acquire a vast area by his
occupation. Everything depends, therefore, upon the
fact how far around the settlement or settlements the
established responsible authority that governs the territory
in the name of the possessor succeeds in gradually
extending the established sovereignty. The payment
of a tribute on the part of tribes settled far away, the
fact that flying columns of the military or the police
sweep, when necessary, remote spots, and many other
facts, can show how far round the settlements the
possessor is really able to assert the established authority.
But it will always be difficult to mark exactly in this
way the boundary of an effective occupation, since
naturally the tendency prevails to extend the sway
constantly and gradually over a wider area. It is,
therefore, a well-known fact that disputes concerning
the boundaries of occupations can only rarely be decided
on the basis of strict law; they must nearly always be
compromised, whether by a treaty or by arbitration.<a id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_442_442">[442]</a></p>

<p>§ 226. <a id="The_growing_desire_to226"></a>The growing desire to acquire vast territories
as colonies on the part of States unable at once to
occupy effectively such territories has, in the second
half of the nineteenth century, led to the contracting
of agreements with the chiefs of natives inhabiting
unoccupied territories, by which these chiefs commit
themselves to the "protectorate" of States that are
members of the Family of Nations. These so-called
protectorates are certainly not protectorates in the
technical sense of the term designating the relation that
exists between a strong and a weak State through a
treaty by which the weak State surrenders itself into
the protection of the strong and transfers to the latter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
the management of its more important international
relations.<a id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_443_443">[443]</a> Neither can they be compared with the

are not the heads of States, but heads of tribal communities
only. Such agreements, although they are
named "Protectorates," are nothing else than steps
taken to exclude other Powers from occupying the
respective territories. They give, like discovery, an
inchoate title, and are preparations and precursors of
future occupations.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Spheres of influence.</p></div>
<p>§ 227. The uncertainty of the extent of an occupation
and the tendency of every colonising State to
extend its occupation constantly and gradually into
the interior, the "Hinterland," of an occupied territory,
has led several States which have colonies in
Africa to secure for themselves "spheres of influence"
by international treaties with other interested Powers.
Spheres of influence are therefore the names of such
territories as are exclusively reserved for future occupation
on the part of a Power which has effectively
occupied adjoining territories. In this way disputes
are avoided for the future, and the interested Powers
can gradually extend their sovereignty over vast territories
without coming into conflict with other Powers.
Thus, to give some examples, Great Britain has concluded
treaties regarding spheres of influence with
Portugal<a id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_445_445">[445]</a> in 1890, with Italy<a id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_446_446">[446]</a> in 1891, with Germany<a id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_447_447">[447]</a>

which now exercises sovereignty over the occupied
territory is hereafter responsible for all events of international
importance on the territory. Such Power has
in especial to keep up a certain order among the native
tribes in order to restrain them from acts of violence
against neighbouring territories, and has eventually to
punish them for such acts.</p>

<p>A question of some importance is how far occupation
affects private property of the inhabitants of the occupied
territory. As according to the modern conception
of State territory the latter is not identical with private
property of the State, occupation brings a territory
under the sovereignty only of the occupying State,
and therefore in no wise touches or affects existing
private property of the inhabitants. In the age of
the discoveries, occupation was indeed considered to
include a title to property over the whole occupied
land, but nowadays this can no longer be maintained.
Being now their sovereign, the occupying State may
impose any burdens it likes on its new subjects, and
may, therefore, even confiscate their private property;
but occupation as a mode of acquiring territory does
not of itself touch or affect private property thereon.
If the Municipal Law of the occupying State does give
a title to private property over the whole occupied
land, such title is not based on International Law.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Conception
of
Accretion.</p></div>
<p>§ 229. Accretion is the name for the increase of land
through new formations. Such new formations may
be a modification only of the existing State territory,
as, for instance, where an island rises within such river
or a part of it as is totally within the territory of one
and the same State; and in such case there is no increase
of territory to correspond with the increase of
land. On the other hand, many new formations occur
which really do enlarge the territory of the State to
which they accrue, as, for instance, where an island rises
within the maritime belt. And it is a customary rule
of the Law of Nations that enlargement of territory, if
any, created through new formations, takes place <i>ipso
facto</i> by the accretion, without the State concerned
taking any special step for the purpose of extending its
sovereignty. Accretion must, therefore, be considered
as a mode of acquiring territory.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Different kinds of Accretion.</p></div>
<p>§ 230. New formations through accretion may be
artificial or natural. They are artificial if they are
the outcome of human work. They are natural if
they are produced through operation of nature. And
within the circle of natural formations different kinds
must again be distinguished—namely, alluvions, deltas,
new-born islands, and abandoned river beds.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Artificial Formations.</p></div>
<p>§ 231. Artificial formations are embankments, breakwaters,
dykes, and the like, built along the river or the
coast-line of the sea. As such artificial new formations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
along the bank of a boundary river may more or less
push the volume of water so far as to encroach upon
the other bank of the river, and as no State is allowed
to alter the natural condition of its own territory to
the disadvantage<a id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_451_451">[451]</a> of the natural conditions of a neighbouring
State territory, a State cannot build embankments,
and the like, of such kind without a previous
agreement with the neighbouring State. But every
State may construct such artificial formations as far
into the sea beyond the low-water mark as it likes, and
thereby gain considerably in land and also in territory,
since the extent of the at least three miles wide maritime
belt is now to be measured from the extended shore.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_451_451"></a><a href="#FNanchor_451_451" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[451]</span></a> See
 above, § <a href="#Just_like_independence127" class="pginternal">127</a>.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Alluvions.</p></div>
<p>§ 232. Alluvion is the name for an accession of land
washed up on the sea-shore or on a river-bank by the
waters. Such accession is as a rule produced by a slow
and gradual process, but sometimes also through a
sudden act of violence, the stream detaching a portion
of the soil from one bank of a river, carrying it over
to the other bank, and embedding it there so as to be
immovable (<i>avulsio</i>). Through alluvions the land and
also the territory of a State may be considerably enlarged.
For, if the alluvion takes place on the shore,
the extent of the territorial maritime belt is now to be
measured from the extended shore. And, if the alluvion
takes place on the one bank of a boundary river, and the
course of the river is thereby naturally so altered that
the waters in consequence cover a part of the other
bank, the boundary line, which runs through the middle
or through the mid-channel,<a id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_452_452">[452]</a> may thereby be extended
into former territory of the other riparian State.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_452_452"></a><a href="#FNanchor_452_452" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[452]</span></a> See
 above, § <a href="#Natural_boundaries199" class="pginternal">199</a>, No. 1.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Deltas.</p></div>
<p>§ 233. Similar to alluvions are Deltas. Delta is the
name for a tract of land at the mouth of a river shaped
like the Greek letter Δ, which land owes its existence
to a gradual deposit by the river of sand, stones, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
earth on one particular place at its mouth. As the
Deltas are continually increasing, the accession of land
they produce may be very considerable, and such
accession is, according to the Law of Nations, considered
an accretion to the land of the State to whose
territory the mouth of the respective river belongs,
although the Delta may be formed outside the territorial
maritime belt. It is evident that in the latter
case an increase of territory is the result, since the at
least three miles wide maritime belt is now to be measured
from the shore of the Delta.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>New-born Islands.</p></div>
<p>§ 234. <a id="The_same_and_other234"></a>The same and other natural processes which
create alluvions on the shore and banks, and Deltas
at the mouths of rivers, lead to the birth of new islands.
If they rise on the High Seas outside the territorial maritime
belt, they are no State's land, and may be acquired
through occupation on the part of any State. But if
they rise in rivers, lakes, and within the maritime belt,
they are, according to the Law of Nations, considered
accretions to the neighbouring land. It is for this
reason that such new islands in boundary rivers as rise
within the boundary line of one of the riparian States
accrue to the land of such State, and that, on the other
hand, such islands as rise upon the boundary line are
divided into parts by it, the respective parts accruing
to the land of the riparian States concerned. If an
island rises within the territorial maritime belt, it
accrues to the land of the littoral State, and the extent
of the maritime belt is now to be measured from the
shore of the new-born island.</p>
<p>An illustrative example is the case<a id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_453_453">[453]</a> of the <i>Anna</i>.
In 1805, during war between Great Britain and Spain,
the British privateer <i>Minerva</i> captured the Spanish
vessel <i>Anna</i> near the mouth of the River Mississippi.
When brought before the British Prize Court, the United<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
States claimed the captured vessel on the ground that
she was captured within the American territorial maritime
belt. Lord Stowell gave judgment in favour of
this claim, because, although it appeared that the capture
did actually take place more than three miles off
the coast of the continent, the place of capture was
within three miles of some small mud-islands composed
of earth and trees drifted down into the sea.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Abandoned Riverbeds.</p></div>
<p>§ 235. <a id="It_happens_sometimes235"></a>It happens sometimes that a river abandons
its bed entirely or dries up altogether. If such river
was a boundary river, the abandoned bed is now the
natural boundary. But often the old boundary line
cannot be ascertained, and in such cases the boundary
line is considered to run through the middle of the
abandoned bed, and the portions <i>ipso facto</i> accrue to
the land of the riparian States, although the territory of
one of these States may become thereby enlarged, and
that of the other diminished.</p>

firmly established the conquest, formally annexed the
territory. Such annexation makes the enemy State

<div class="sidenote"><p>Subjugation in Contradistinction to Occupation.</p></div>
<p>§ 237. Some writers<a id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_456_456">[456]</a> maintain that subjugation is
only a special case of occupation, because, as they
assert, through conquest the enemy territory becomes
no State's land and the conqueror can acquire it by
turning his military occupation into absolute occupation.
Yet this opinion cannot be upheld, because military
occupation, which is conquest, in no way makes
enemy territory no State's land. Conquered enemy
territory, although actually in possession and under the
sway of the conqueror, remains legally under the sovereignty
of the enemy until through annexation it comes
under the sovereignty of the conqueror. Annexation
turns the conquest into subjugation. It is the very
annexation which <i>uno actu</i> makes the vanquished State
cease to exist and brings the territory under the conqueror's
sovereignty. Thus the subjugated territory
has not for one moment been no State's land, but comes
from the enemy's into the conqueror's sovereignty,
although not through cession, but through annexation.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Justification of Subjugation as a Mode of Acquisition.</p></div>
<p>§ 238. As long as a Law of Nations has been in
existence, the States as well as the vast majority of
writers have recognised subjugation as a mode of
acquiring territory. Its justification lies in the fact
that war is a contention between States for the purpose
of overpowering one another. States which go to war
know beforehand that they risk more or less their very
existence, and that it may be a necessity for the victor
to annex the conquered enemy territory, be it in the
interest of national unity or of safety against further
attacks, or for other reasons. One must hope that the
time will come when war will disappear entirely, but, as
long as war exists, subjugation will also be recognised.
If some writers<a id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_457_457">[457]</a> refuse to recognise subjugation at all
as a mode of acquiring territory, they show a lack of
insight into the historical development of States and
nations.<a id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_458_458">[458]</a></p>

Code N. See also Despagnet, Nos. 387-390.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_458_458"></a><a href="#FNanchor_458_458" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[458]</span></a> It should be mentioned that the Pan-American Congress at
Washington, 1890, passed a resolution that conquest should hereafter not
be a mode of acquisition of territory in America; see Moore, I. § 87.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Subjugation of the whole or of a part of Enemy Territory.</p></div>
<p>§ 239. Subjugation is as a rule a mode of acquiring
the entire enemy territory. The actual process is
regularly that the victor destroys the enemy military
forces, takes possession of the enemy territory, and then
annexes it, although the head and the Government of
the extinguished State might have fled, might protest,
and still keep up a claim. Thus after the war with
Austria and her allies in 1866, Prussia subjugated the
territories of the Duchy of Nassau, the Kingdom of
Hanover, the Electorate of Hesse-Cassel, and the Free
Town of Frankfort-on-the-Main; and Great Britain
subjugated in 1900 the territories of the Orange Free
State and the South African Republic.</p>
<p>But it is possible, although it will nowadays hardly
occur, for a State to conquer and annex a part of enemy
territory, whether the war ends by a Treaty of Peace<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
in which the vanquished State, without ceding the
conquered territory, submits silently<a id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_459_459">[459]</a> to the annexation,
or by simple cessation of hostilities.<a id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_460_460">[460]</a></p>

<p>It must, however, be emphasised that such a mode
of acquiring a part of enemy territory is totally different
from forcibly taking possession of a part thereof during
the continuance of war. Such a conquest, although the
conqueror may intend to keep the conquered territory
and therefore annex it, is not a title as long as the war
has not terminated either actually through simple cessation
of hostilities or through a Treaty of Peace.
Therefore, the practice, which sometimes prevails, of
annexing a conquered part of enemy territory during
war cannot be approved. Concerning subjugation either
of the whole or of a part of enemy territory, it must be
asserted that annexation gives a title only after a
<i>firmly established</i> conquest. So long as war continues,
conquest is not firmly established.<a id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_461_461">[461]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Consequences of Subjugation.</p></div>
<p>§ 240. <a id="Although_subjugation240"></a>Although subjugation is an original mode of
acquisition, since the sovereignty of the new acquirer
is not derived from that of the former owner State, the
new owner State is nevertheless the successor of the
former owner State as regards many points which have
been discussed above (§ <a href="#When_a_State_merges82" class="pginternal">82</a>). It must be specially mentioned
that, as far as the Law of Nations is concerned,
the subjugator does not acquire the private property
of the inhabitants of the annexed territory. Being
now their Sovereign, the subjugating State may indeed
impose any burdens it pleases on its new subjects, it
may even confiscate their private property, since a
Sovereign State can do what it likes with its subjects,
but subjugation itself does not by International Law
touch or affect private property.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span></p>
<p>As regards the national status of the subjects of
the subjugated State, doctrine and practice agree that
such enemy subjects as are domiciled on the annexed
territory and remain there after annexation become
<i>ipso facto</i> by the subjugation<a id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_462_462">[462]</a> subjects of the subjugator.
But the national status of such enemy subjects
as are domiciled abroad and do not return, and further
of such as leave the country before the annexation or
immediately afterwards, is matter of dispute. Some
writers maintain that these individuals do in spite of
their absence become subjects of the subjugator, others
emphatically deny it. Whereas the practice of the
United States of America seems to be in conformity
with the latter opinion,<a id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_463_463">[463]</a> the practice of Prussia in 1866
was in conformity with the former. Thus in the case
of Count Platen-Hallermund, a Cabinet Minister of
King George V. of Hanover, who left Hanover with his
King before the annexation in 1866 and was in 1868
prosecuted for high treason before the Supreme Prussian
Court at Berlin, this Court decided that the accused had
become a Prussian subject through the annexation of
Hanover.<a id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_464_464">[464]</a> I believe that a distinction must be made
between those individuals who leave the country <i>before</i>
and those who leave it <i>after</i> annexation. The former
are not under the sway of the subjugator at the time
of annexation, and, since the personal supremacy of
their home State terminates with the latter's extinction
through annexation, they would seem to be outside the
sovereignty of the subjugator. But those individuals
who leave the country <i>after</i> annexation leave it at a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
time when they have become subjects of the new Sovereign,
and they therefore remain such subjects even
after they have left the country, for there is no rule of
the Law of Nations in existence which obliges a subjugator
to grant the privilege of emigration<a id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_465_465">[465]</a> to the
inhabitants of the conquered territory.</p>

 Hall <i>v.</i> Campbell (1774), 1 Cowper 1208, and United

that of cession: see
 above, § <a href="#As_the_object219" class="pginternal">219</a>; Keith, "The Theory of State
Succession" (1907), pp. 45 and 48; Moore, III. § 379.</p></div>

have a free option to stay or leave the country; but there is no rule of
International Law which imposes the duty upon a subjugator to grant this
option.</p></div>
<p>Different from the fact that enemy subjects become
through annexation subjects of the subjugator is the
question what position they acquire within the subjugating
State. This question is one of Municipal, and
not of International Law. The subjugator can, if he
likes, allow them to emigrate and to renounce their
newly acquired citizenship, and the Municipal Law of
the subjugating State can put them in any position it
likes, can in especial grant or refuse them the same
rights as those which its citizens by birth enjoy.</p>

right of intervention, the conqueror has not in fact an
unlimited possibility of annexation of the territory of
the vanquished State. When the balance of power is
endangered or when other vital interests are at stake,
third Powers can and will intervene, and history records
many instances of such interventions. But it must be
emphasised that the validity of the title of the subjugator
does not depend upon recognition on the part
of other Powers. And a mere protest of a third Power
is of no legal weight either.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Conception of Prescription.</p></div>
<p>§ 242. Since the existence of a science of the Law
of Nations there has always been opposition to prescription
as a mode of acquiring territory. Grotius
rejected the usucaption of the Roman Law, yet adopted
the same law's <i>immemorial</i> prescription<a id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_467_467">[467]</a> for the Law
of Nations. But whereas a good many writers<a id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_468_468">[468]</a> still
defend that standpoint, others<a id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_469_469">[469]</a> reject prescription
altogether. Again, others<a id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_470_470">[470]</a> go beyond Grotius and his
followers and do not require possession from time <i>immemorial</i>,
but teach that an undisturbed continuous
possession can under certain conditions produce a title
for the possessor, if the possession has lasted for some
length of time.</p>

534, and many others.</p></div>
<p>This opinion would indeed seem to be correct, because
it recognises theoretically what actually goes on
in practice. There is no doubt that in the practice of
the members of the Family of Nations a State is considered
to be the lawful owner even of those parts of
its territory of which originally it took possession wrongfully
and unlawfully, provided only the possessor has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
been in undisturbed possession for such a length of
time as is necessary to create the general conviction
among the members of the Family of Nations that the
present condition of things is in conformity with international
order. Such prescription cannot be compared
with the usucaption of Roman Law because the latter
required <i>bona-fide</i> possession, whereas the Law of
Nations recognises prescription both in cases where
the State is in <i>bona-fide</i> possession and in cases where
it is not. The basis of prescription in International
Law is nothing else than general recognition<a id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_471_471">[471]</a> of a fact,
however unlawful in its origin, on the part of the members
of the Family of Nations. And prescription in
International Law may therefore be defined as <i>the
acquisition of sovereignty over a territory through continuous
and undisturbed exercise of sovereignty over it
during such a period as is necessary to create under the
influence of historical development the general conviction
that the present condition of things is in conformity with
international order</i>. Thus, prescription in International
Law has the same rational basis as prescription in
Municipal Law—namely, the creation of stability of
order.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_471_471"></a><a href="#FNanchor_471_471" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[471]</span></a> This is pointed out with great lucidity by Heimburger, pp.
151-155; he rejects, however, prescription as a mode of acquiring
territory, maintaining that there is a customary rule of International
Law in existence according to which recognition can make good originally
wrongful possession.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Prescription how effected.</p></div>
<p>§ 243. From the conception of prescription, as above
defined, it becomes apparent that no general rule can
be laid down as regards the length of time and other
circumstances which are necessary to create a title by
prescription. Everything depends upon the merits of
the individual case. As long as other Powers keep up
protests and claims, the actual exercise of sovereignty
is not undisturbed, nor is there the required general
conviction that the present condition of things is in
conformity with international order. But after such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
protests and claims, if any, cease to be repeated, the
actual possession ceases to be disturbed, and thus under
certain circumstances matters may gradually ripen into
that condition which is in conformity with international
order. The question, at what time and under what
circumstances such a condition of things arises, is not
one of law but of fact. The question, for instance,
whether, although the three partitions of Poland were
wrongful and unlawful acts, Prussia, Austria, and
Russia have now a good title by prescription to hold
territories which were formerly Polish must, I doubt
not, be answered in the affirmative. For all the members
of the Family of Nations have now silently acquiesced
in the present condition of things, although as
late as 1846 Great Britain and France protested against
the annexation of the Republic of Cracow on the part of
Austria. In spite of the fact that the Polish nation
has not yet given up its hope of seeing a Polish
State re-established on the former Polish territory, the
general conviction among the members of the Family
of Nations is that the present condition of things is
in conformity with international order. When, to give
another example, a State which originally held an island
<i>mala fide</i> under the title by occupation, knowing well
that this land had already been occupied by another
State, has succeeded in keeping up its possession undisturbed
for so long a time that the former possessor
has ceased to protest and has silently dropped the
claim, the conviction will be prevalent among the members
of the Family of Nations that the present condition
of things is in conformity with international order.
These examples show why a certain number of years<a id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_472_472">[472]</a>
cannot, <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>once for all, be fixed to create the title by prescription.
There are indeed immeasurable and imponderable
circumstances and influences besides the
mere run of time<a id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_473_473">[473]</a> at work to create the conviction on
the part of the members of the Family of Nations that
in the interest of stability of order the present possessor
should be considered the rightful owner of a territory.
And these circumstances and influences, which are of
a political and historical character, differ so much in
the different cases that the length of time necessary
for prescription must likewise differ.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_472_472"></a><a href="#FNanchor_472_472" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[472]</span></a> Vattel (II. § 151) suggests that the members of the Family
of Nations should enter into an agreement stipulating the number of
years necessary for prescription, and David Dudley Field proposes the
following rule (52) in his Outlines of an International Code: "The
uninterrupted possession of territory or other property for fifty years
by a nation excludes the claim of every other nation."</p></div>

kein Tag Recht" is met by the fact that it is not the operation of time
alone, but the co-operation of other circumstances and influences which
creates the title by prescription.</p></div>

cession, dereliction, operation of nature, subjugation,
prescription. But there is a sixth mode of
losing territory—namely, revolt. No special details are
necessary with regard to loss of territory through subjugation,
prescription, and cession, except that it is of
some importance to repeat here that the historical cases
of pledging, leasing, and giving territory to another
State to administer are in fact, although not in strict
law, nothing else than cessions<a id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_474_474">[474]</a> of territory. But
operation of nature, revolt, and dereliction must be
specially discussed.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Operation of Nature.</p></div>
<p>§ 245. Operation of nature as a mode of losing corresponds
to accretion as a mode of acquiring territory.
Just as through accretion a State may become enlarged,
so it may become diminished through the disappearance
of land and other operations of nature. And the loss
of territory through operation of nature takes place
<i>ipso facto</i> by such operation. Thus, if an island near
the shore disappears through volcanic action, the extent
of the maritime territorial belt of the respective littoral
State is hereafter to be measured from the low-water
mark of the shore of the continent, instead of from the
shore of the former island. Thus, further, if through a
piece of land being detached by the current of a river
from one bank and carried over to the other bank, the
river alters its course and covers now part of the land
on the bank from which such piece became detached,
the territory of one of the riparian States may decrease
through the boundary line being <i>ipso facto</i> transferred
to the present middle or mid-channel of the river.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Revolt.</p></div>
<p>§ 246. Revolt followed by secession is a mode of
losing territory to which no mode of acquisition corresponds.<a id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_475_475">[475]</a>
Revolt followed by secession has, as history
teaches, frequently been a cause of loss of territory.
Thus the Netherlands fell away from Spain in 1579,
Belgium from the Netherlands in 1830, the United States
of America from Great Britain in 1776, Brazil from
Portugal in 1822, the former Spanish South American
States from Spain in 1810, Greece from Turkey in 1830,
Cuba from Spain in 1898, Panama from Colombia in
1903. The question at what time a loss of territory
through revolt is consummated cannot be answered
once for all, since no hard-and-fast rule can be laid
down regarding the time when it can be said that a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
State broken off from another has established itself
safely and permanently. The matter has, as will be
remembered, been treated above (§ 74), in connection
with recognition. It may well happen that, although
such a seceded State is already recognised by a third
Power, the mother country does not consider the territory
to be lost and succeeds in reconquering it.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_475_475"></a><a href="#FNanchor_475_475" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[475]</span></a> The possible case where a province revolts, secedes from
the mother country, and, after having successfully defended itself
against the attempts of the latter to reconquer it, unites itself with
the territory of another State, is a case of merger by cession of the
whole territory.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Dereliction.</p></div>
<p>§ 247. <a id="Dereliction_as_a_mode247"></a>Dereliction as a mode of losing corresponds
to occupation as a mode of acquiring territory. Dereliction
frees a territory from the sovereignty of the
present owner State. Dereliction is effected through
the owner State's complete abandonment of the territory
with the intention of withdrawing from it for ever,
thus relinquishing sovereignty over it. Just as occupation<a id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_476_476">[476]</a>
requires, first, the actual taking into possession
(<i>corpus</i>) of territory and, secondly, the intention (<i>animus</i>)
to acquire sovereignty over it, so dereliction requires,
first, actual abandonment of a territory, and, secondly,
the intention to give up sovereignty over it. Actual
abandonment alone does not involve dereliction as long
as it must be presumed that the owner has the will and
ability to retake possession of the territory. Thus, for
instance, if the rising of natives forces a State to withdraw
from a territory, such territory is not derelict as
long as the former possessor is able and makes efforts
to retake possession. It is only when a territory is
really derelict that any State may acquire it through
occupation.<a id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_477_477">[477]</a> History knows of several such cases.
But very often, when such occupation of derelict territory
occurs, the former owner protests and tries to
prevent the new occupier from acquiring it. The cases
of the island of Santa Lucia and of the Delagoa Bay
may be quoted as illustrations:—</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_476_476"></a><a href="#FNanchor_476_476" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[476]</span></a> See

<p>(<i>a</i>) In 1639 Santa Lucia, one of the Antilles Islands,
was occupied by England, but in the following year<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
the English settlers were massacred by the natives.
No attempt was made by England to retake the island,
and France, considering it no man's land, took possession
of it in 1650. In 1664 an English force under
Lord Willoughby attacked the French, drove them into
the mountains, and held the island until 1667, when
the English withdrew and the French returned from
the mountains. No further step was made by England
to retake the island, but she nevertheless asserted for
many years to come that she had not abandoned it
<i>sine spe redeundi</i>, and that, therefore, France in 1650
had no right to consider it no man's land. Finally,
however, England resigned her claims by the Peace
Treaty of Paris of 1763.<a id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_478_478">[478]</a></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) In 1823 England occupied, in consequence of a
so-called cession from native chiefs, a piece of territory
at Delagoa Bay, which Portugal claimed as part of the
territory owned by her at the bay, maintaining that
the chiefs concerned were rebels. The dispute was not
settled until 1875, when the case was submitted to
the arbitration of the President of France. The award
was given in favour of Portugal, since the interruption
of the Portuguese occupation in 1823 was not to be
considered as abandonment of a territory over which
Portugal had exercised sovereignty for nearly three
hundred years.<a id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_479_479">[479]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Former Claims to Control over the Sea.</p></div>
<p>§ 248. <a id="In_antiquity248"></a>In antiquity and the first half of the Middle
Ages navigation on the Open Sea was free to everybody.
According to Ulpianus,<a id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_480_480">[480]</a> the sea is open to everybody
by nature, and, according to Celsus,<a id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_481_481">[481]</a> the sea, like the
air, is common to all mankind. Since no Law of Nations
in the modern sense of the term existed during antiquity
and the greater part of the Middle Ages, no importance
is to be attached to the pronouncement of
Antoninus Pius, Roman Emperor from 138 to 161:—"Being<a id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_482_482">[482]</a>
the Emperor of the world, I am consequently
the law of the sea." Nor is it of importance that the
Emperors of the old German Empire, who were considered
to be the successors of the Roman Emperors,
styled themselves among other titles "King of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
Ocean." Real claims to sovereignty over parts of the
Open Sea begin, however, to be made in the second
half of the Middle Ages. And there is no doubt whatever
that at the time when the modern Law of Nations
gradually rose it was the conviction of the States that
they could extend their sovereignty over certain parts
of the Open Sea. Thus, the Republic of Venice was
recognised as the Sovereign over the Adriatic Sea, and
the Republic of Genoa as the Sovereign of the Ligurian
Sea. Portugal claimed sovereignty over the whole of
the Indian Ocean and of the Atlantic south of Morocco,
Spain over the Pacific and the Gulf of Mexico, both
Portugal and Spain basing their claims on two Papal
Bulls promulgated by Alexander VI. in 1493, which
divided the new world between these Powers. Sweden
and Denmark claimed sovereignty over the Baltic,
Great Britain over the Narrow Seas, the North Sea,
and the Atlantic from the North Cape to Cape Finisterre.</p>

<p>These claims have been more or less successfully
asserted for several hundreds of years. They were
favoured by a number of different circumstances, such
as the maintenance of an effective protection against
piracy for instance. And numerous examples can be
adduced which show that such claims have more or
less been recognised. Thus, Frederick III., Emperor
of Germany, had in 1478 to ask the permission of Venice
for a transportation of corn from Apulia through the
Adriatic Sea.<a id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_483_483">[483]</a> Thus, Great Britain in the seventeenth
century compelled foreigners to take out an English
licence for fishing in the North Sea; and when in 1636
the Dutch attempted to fish without such licence, they
were attacked and compelled to pay £30,000 as the
price for the indulgence.<a id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_484_484">[484]</a> Again, when Philip II. of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
Spain was in 1554 on his way to England to marry
Queen Mary, the British Admiral, who met him in the
"British Seas," fired on his ship for flying the Spanish
flag. And the King of Denmark, when returning from
a visit to James I. in 1606, was forced by a British
captain, who met him off the mouth of the Thames, to
strike the Danish flag.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Practical Expression of claims to Maritime Sovereignty.</p></div>
<p>§ 249. Maritime sovereignty found expression in
maritime ceremonials at least. Such State as claimed
sovereignty over a part of the Open Sea required
foreign vessels navigating on that part to honour its
flag<a id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_485_485">[485]</a> as a symbol of recognition of its sovereignty.
So late as 1805 the British Admiralty Regulations
contained an order<a id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_486_486">[486]</a> to the effect that "when any of
His Majesty's ships shall meet with the ships of any
foreign Power within His Majesty's Seas (which extend
to Cape Finisterre), it is expected that the said foreign
ships do strike their topsail and take in their flag, in
acknowledgment of His Majesty's sovereignty in those
seas; and if any do resist, all flag officers and commanders
are to use their utmost endeavours to compel
them thereto, and not suffer any dishonour to be done
to His Majesty."</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_485_485"></a><a href="#FNanchor_485_485" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[485]</span></a> See
 Fulton, "The Sovereignty of
the Seas" (1911), pp. 38 and 204-208.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_486_486"></a><a href="#FNanchor_486_486" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[486]</span></a> Quoted by Hall, § 40.</p></div>
<p>But apart from maritime ceremonials maritime sovereignty
found expression in the levying of tolls from
foreign ships, in the interdiction of fisheries to foreigners,
and in the control or even the prohibition of foreign
navigation. Thus, Portugal and Spain attempted, after
the discovery of America, to keep foreign vessels altogether
out of the seas over which they claimed sovereignty.
The magnitude of this claim created an
opposition to the very existence of such rights. English,
French, and Dutch explorers and traders navigated on
the Indian Ocean and the Pacific in spite of the Spanish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
and Portuguese interdictions. And when, in 1580,
the Spanish ambassador Mendoza lodged a complaint
with Queen Elizabeth against Drake for having made
his famous voyage to the Pacific, Elizabeth answered
that vessels of all nations could navigate on the Pacific,
since the use of the sea and the air is common to all,
and that no title to the ocean can belong to any nation,
since neither nature nor regard for the public use
permits any possession of the ocean.<a id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_487_487">[487]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_487_487"></a><a href="#FNanchor_487_487" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[487]</span></a> See
 Walker, "History," I. p. 161. It is obvious that this
attitude of Queen Elizabeth was in no way the outcome of the conviction
that really no State could claim sovereignty over a part of the Open
Sea. For she herself did not think of dropping the British claims to
sovereignty over the "British Seas." Her arguments against the Spanish
claims were made in the interest of the growing commerce and navigation
of England, and any one daring to apply the same arguments against
England's claims would have incurred her royal displeasure.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Grotius's Attack on Maritime Sovereignty.</p></div>
<p>§ 250. <a id="Queen_Elizabeths_attitude250"></a>Queen Elizabeth's attitude was the germ out
of which grew gradually the present freedom of the
Open Sea. Twenty-nine years after her answer to
Mendoza, in 1609, appeared Grotius's short treatise<a id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_488_488">[488]</a>
"Mare liberum." The intention of Grotius was to
show that the Dutch had a right of navigation and
commerce with the Indies in spite of the Portuguese
interdictions. He contends that the sea cannot be
State property, because it cannot really be taken into
possession through occupation,<a id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_489_489">[489]</a> and that consequently
the sea is by nature free from the sovereignty of any
State.<a id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_490_490">[490]</a> The attack of Grotius was met by several
authors of different nations. Gentilis defends Spanish
and English claims in his "Advocatio Hispanica,"
which appeared in 1613. Likewise, in 1613 William
Welwood defends the English claims in his book, "De
dominio maris." John Selden wrote his "Mare Clausum<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
sive de dominio maris" in 1618, but it was not
printed until 1635. Sir John Burroughs published in
1653 his book, "The Sovereignty of the British Seas
proved by Records, History, and the Municipal Laws
of this Kingdom." And in defence of the claims of
the Republic of Venice Paolo Sarpi published in 1676
his book "Del dominio del mare Adriatico." The
most important of these books defending maritime
sovereignty is that of Selden. King Charles I., by
whose command Selden's "Mare Clausum" was printed
in 1635, was so much impressed by it that he instructed
in 1629 his ambassador in the Netherlands to complain
of the audacity of Grotius and to request that the
author of the "Mare liberum" should be punished.<a id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_491_491">[491]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_488_488"></a><a href="#FNanchor_488_488" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[488]</span></a> Its full title is: "Mare liberum, seu de jure quod Batavis
competit ad Indicana commercia Dissertatio," and it is now proved that
this short treatise is only chapter 12 of another work of Grotius, "De
jure praedae," which was found in manuscript in 1864 and published in
1868. See

<p>The general opposition to Grotius's bold attack on
maritime sovereignty prevented his immediate victory.
Too firmly established were the then recognised claims
to sovereignty over certain parts of the Open Sea for
the novel principle of the freedom of the sea to supplant
them. Progress was made regarding one point only—namely,
freedom of navigation of the sea. England
had never pushed her claims so far as to attempt the
prohibition of free navigation on the so-called British
Seas. And although Venice succeeded in keeping up
her control of navigation on the Adriatic till the middle
of the seventeenth century, it may be said that in the
second half of that century navigation on all parts of
the Open Sea was practically free for vessels of all
nations. But with regard to other points, claims to
maritime sovereignty continued to be kept up. Thus
the Netherlands had by article 4 of the Treaty of Westminster,
1674, to acknowledge that their vessels had
to salute the British flag within the "British Seas"
as a recognition of British maritime sovereignty.<a id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_492_492">[492]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_492_492"></a><a href="#FNanchor_492_492" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[492]</span></a> See
 Hall, § 40, p. 152, note 1.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Gradual Recognition of the Freedom of the Open Sea.</p></div>
<p>§ 251. <a id="In_spite_of_opposition251"></a>In spite of opposition, the work of Grotius<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
was not to be undone. All prominent writers of the
eighteenth century take up again the case of the freedom
of the Open Sea, making a distinction between
the maritime belt which is to be considered under the
sway of the littoral States, and, on the other hand,
the High Seas, which are under no State's sovereignty.
The leading author is Bynkershoek, whose standard
work, "De dominio maris," appeared in 1702. Vattel,
G. F. de Martens, Azuni, and others follow the lead.
And although Great Britain upheld her claim to the
salute due to her flag within the "British Seas" throughout
the eighteenth and at the beginning of the nineteenth
century, the principle of the freedom of the Open
Sea became more and more vigorous with the growth
of the navies of other States; and at the end of the
first quarter of the nineteenth century this principle
became universally recognised in theory and practice.
Great Britain silently dropped her claim to the salute
due to her flag, and with it her claim to maritime sovereignty,
and became now a champion of the freedom
of the Open Sea. When, in 1821, Russia, who was
then still the owner of Alaska in North America, attempted
to prohibit all foreign ships from approaching
the shore of Alaska within one hundred Italian miles,
Great Britain and the United States protested in the
interest of the freedom of the Open Sea, and Russia
dropped her claims in conventions concluded with the
protesting Powers in 1824 and 1825. And when, after
Russia had sold Alaska in 1867 to the United States,
the latter made regulations regarding the killing of
seals within Behring Sea, claiming thereby jurisdiction
and control over a part of the Open Sea, a conflict arose
in 1886 with Great Britain, which was settled by arbitration<a id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_493_493">[493]</a>
in 1893 in favour of the freedom of the Open Sea.</p>

body of salt water all over the greater part of the globe,
with the exception of the maritime belt and the territorial
straits, gulfs, and bays, which are parts of the
sea, but not parts of the Open Sea. Wherever there is
a salt-water sea on the globe, it is part of the Open Sea,
provided it is not isolated from, but coherent with, the
general body of salt water extending over the globe,
and provided that the salt water approach to it is
navigable and open to vessels of all nations. The enclosure
of a sea by the land of one and the same State
does not matter, provided such a navigable connection
of salt water as is open to vessels of all nations exists
between such sea and the general body of salt water,
even if that navigable connection itself be part of
the territory of one or more littoral States. Whereas,
therefore, the Dead Sea is Turkish and the Aral Sea
is Russian territory, the Sea of Marmora is part of
the Open Sea, although it is surrounded by Turkish
land and although the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles
are Turkish territorial straits, because these are now
open to merchantmen of all nations. For the same
reason the Black Sea<a id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_495_495">[495]</a> is now part of the Open Sea.
On the other hand, the Sea of Azoff is not part of the
Open Sea, but Russian territory, although there exists
a navigable connection between it and the Black Sea.
The reason is that this connection, the Strait of Kertch,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
is not according to the Law of Nations open to vessels
of all nations, since the Sea of Azoff is less a sea than

<div class="sidenote"><p>Meaning of the Term "Freedom of the Open Sea."</p></div>
<p>§ 254. The term "Freedom of the Open Sea" indicates
the rule of the Law of Nations that the Open Sea
is not and never can be under the sovereignty of any
State whatever. Since, therefore, the Open Sea is not
the territory of any State, no State has as a rule a right
to exercise its legislation, administration, jurisdiction,<a id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_499_499">[499]</a>
or police<a id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_500_500">[500]</a> over parts of the Open Sea. Since, further,
the Open Sea can never be under the sovereignty of any
State, no State has a right to acquire parts of the Open
Sea through occupation,<a id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_501_501">[501]</a> for, as far as the acquisition
of territory is concerned, the Open Sea is what Roman
Law calls <i>res extra commercium</i>.<a id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_502_502">[502]</a> But although the
Open Sea is not the territory of any State, it is nevertheless
an object of the Law of Nations. The very fact
alone of such a rule exempting the Open Sea from the
sovereignty of any State whatever shows this. But
there are other reasons. For if the Law of Nations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
were to content itself with the rule which excludes the
Open Sea from possible State property, the consequence
would be a condition of lawlessness and anarchy on the
Open Sea. To obviate such lawlessness, customary
International Law contains some rules which guarantee
a certain legal order on the Open Sea in spite of the
fact that it is not the territory of any State.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_499_499"></a><a href="#FNanchor_499_499" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[499]</span></a> As regards jurisdiction in cases of collision and salvage
on the Open Sea, see
 below, §§ <a href="#No_rules_of_the_Law265" class="pginternal">265</a>
 and <a href="#It_is_at_present271" class="pginternal">271</a>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_501_501"></a><a href="#FNanchor_501_501" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[501]</span></a> Following Grotius (II. c. 3, § 13) and Bynkershoek ("De
dominio maris," c. 3), some writers (for instance, Phillimore, I. § 203)
maintain that any part of the Open Sea covered for the time by a vessel
is by occupation to be considered as the temporary territory of the
vessel's flag State. And some French writers go even beyond that and
claim a certain zone round the respective vessel as temporary territory
of the flag State. But this is an absolutely superfluous fiction. (See
Stoerk in Holtzendorff, II. p. 494; Rivier, I. p. 238; Perels, pp.
37-39.)</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_502_502"></a><a href="#FNanchor_502_502" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[502]</span></a> But the subsoil of the bed of the Open Sea can well,
through driving mines and piercing tunnels from the coast, be acquired
by a littoral State. See
 above, § <a href="#Only_such_territory221" class="pginternal">221</a>, and
 below, §§ <a href="#The_subsoil287c" class="pginternal">287<i>c</i></a>
 and <a href="#Since_there_is287d" class="pginternal">287<i>d</i></a>.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Legal Provisions for the Open Sea.</p></div>
<p>§ 255. <a id="This_legal_order255"></a>This legal order is created through the co-operation
of the Law of Nations and the Municipal
Laws of such States as possess a maritime flag. The
following rules of the Law of Nations are universally
recognised, namely:—First, that every State which has
a maritime flag must lay down rules according to
which vessels can claim to sail under its flag, and must
furnish such vessels with some official voucher authorising
them to make use of its flag; secondly, that every
State has a right to punish all such foreign vessels as
sail under its flag without being authorised to do so;
thirdly, that all vessels with their persons and goods
are, whilst on the Open Sea, considered under the sway
of the flag State; fourthly, that every State has a right
to punish piracy on the Open Seas even if committed
by foreigners, and that, with a view to the extinction
of piracy, men-of-war of all nations can require all
suspect vessels to show their flag.</p>
<p>These customary rules of International Law are, so
to say, supplemented by Municipal Laws of the maritime
States comprising provisions, first, regarding the
conditions to be fulfilled by vessels for the purpose of
being authorised to sail under their flags; secondly,
regarding the details of jurisdiction over persons and
goods on board vessels sailing under their flags; thirdly,
concerning the order on board ship and the relations
between the master, the crew, and the passengers;
fourthly, concerning punishment of ships sailing without
authorisation under their flags.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span></p>
<p>The fact that each maritime State has a right to
legislate for its own vessels gives it a share in keeping
up a certain order on the Open Sea. And such order
has been turned into a more or less general order since
the large maritime States have concurrently made more
or less concordant laws for the conduct of their vessels
on the Open Sea.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Freedom of the Open Sea and war.</p></div>
<p>§ 256. <a id="Al256"></a>Although the Open Sea is free and not the
territory of any State, it may nevertheless in its whole
extent become the theatre of war, since the region of
war is not only the territories of the belligerents, but
likewise the Open Sea, provided that one of the belligerents
at least is a Power with a maritime flag.<a id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_503_503">[503]</a> Men-of-war
of the belligerents may fight a battle in any part
of the Open Sea where they meet, and they may capture
all enemy merchantmen they meet on the Open
Sea. And, further, the jurisdiction and police of the
belligerents become through the outbreak of war in so
far extended over vessels of other States, that belligerent
men-of-war may now visit, search, and capture
neutral merchantmen for breach of blockade, contraband,
and the like.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_503_503"></a><a href="#FNanchor_503_503" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[503]</span></a> Concerning the distinction between theatre and region of war, see

<p>However, certain parts of the Open Sea can become
neutralised and thereby be excluded from the region
of war. Thus, the Black Sea became neutralised in
1856 through article 11 of the Peace Treaty of Paris
stipulating:—"La Mer Noire est neutralisée: ouverte
à la marine marchande de toutes les nations, ses eaux
et ses ports sont formellement et à perpétuité interdites
au pavillon de guerre, soit des puissances riveraines,
soit de tout autre puissance." Yet this neutralisation
of the Black Sea was abolished<a id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_504_504">[504]</a> in 1871 by article 1
of the Treaty of London, and no other part of the Open
Sea is at present neutralised.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Navigation and ceremonials on the Open Sea.</p></div>
<p>§ 257. <a id="The_freedom_of_the_Open257"></a>The freedom of the Open Sea involves perfect
freedom of navigation for vessels of all nations,
whether men-of-war, other public vessels, or merchantmen.
It involves, further, absence of compulsory
maritime ceremonials on the Open Sea. According to
the Law of Nations, no rights whatever of salute exist
between vessels meeting on the Open Sea. All so-called
maritime ceremonials on the Open Sea<a id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_505_505">[505]</a> are a matter
either of courtesy and usage or of special conventions and
Municipal Laws of those States under whose flags
vessels sail. There is in especial no right of any State
to require a salute from foreign merchantmen for its
men-of-war.<a id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_506_506">[506]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_505_505"></a><a href="#FNanchor_505_505" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[505]</span></a> But not within the maritime belt
or other territorial waters. See
 above, §§ <a href="#Connected_with_the_dignity122" class="pginternal">122</a>
 and <a href="#Theory_and_practice_agree187" class="pginternal">187</a>.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_506_506"></a><a href="#FNanchor_506_506" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[506]</span></a> That men-of-war can on the
Open Sea ask suspicious foreign
merchantmen to show their flags has
nothing to do with ceremonials, but
with the supervision of the Open Sea
in the interest of its safety. See
 below, § <a href="#Although_the_freedom266" class="pginternal">266</a>.</p></div>
<p>The freedom of the Open Sea involves likewise
freedom of inoffensive passage<a id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_507_507">[507]</a> through the maritime
belt for merchantmen of all nations, and also for men-of-war
of all nations in so far as the part concerned of
the maritime belt forms a part of the highways for
international traffic. Without such freedom of passage,
navigation on the Open Sea by vessels of all nations
would be a physical impossibility.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_507_507"></a><a href="#FNanchor_507_507" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[507]</span></a> See

<div class="sidenote"><p>Claim of States to Maritime Flag.</p></div>
<p>§ 258. <a id="Since_no_State_can258"></a>Since no State can exercise protection over
vessels that do not sail under its flag, and since every
vessel must, in the interest of the order and safety of
the Open Sea, sail under the flag of a State, the question
has been raised whether not only maritime States
but also such States as are not littoral States of the
Sea have a claim to a maritime flag. There ought to
be no doubt<a id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_508_508">[508]</a> that the freedom of the Open Sea involves
a claim of any State to a maritime flag. At present
no non-littoral State actually has a maritime flag, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
all vessels belonging to subjects of such non-littoral
States sail under the flag of a maritime State. But
any day might bring a change. The question as to the
claim to a maritime flag on the part of a non-littoral
State was discussed in Switzerland. When, in 1864,
Swiss merchants in Trieste, Smyrna, Hamburg, and
St. Petersburg applied to the Swiss Bundesrath for permission
to have their vessels sailing under the Swiss
flag, the Bundesrath was ready to comply with the
request, but the Swiss Parliament, the Bundesversammlung,
refused the necessary consent. In 1889 and 1891
new applications of the same kind were made, but
Switzerland again refused to have a maritime flag.<a id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_509_509">[509]</a>
She had no doubt that she had a claim to such flag, but
was aware of the difficulties arising from the fact that,
having no seaports of her own, vessels sailing under
her flag would in many points have to depend upon
the goodwill of the maritime Powers.<a id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_510_510">[510]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_508_508"></a><a href="#FNanchor_508_508" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[508]</span></a> See,
 however, Westlake, I. p. 165.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_509_509"></a><a href="#FNanchor_509_509" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[509]</span></a> See
 Salis, "Schweizerisches Bundesrecht" (1891), vol. I. p.

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_510_510"></a><a href="#FNanchor_510_510" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[510]</span></a> The question is discussed by Calvo, I. § 427; Twiss, I. §§
197 and 198; and Westlake, I. p. 165.</p></div>
<p>Such States as have a maritime flag as a rule have
a war flag different from their commercial flag; some
States, however, have one and the same flag for both
their navy and their mercantile marine. But it must
be mentioned that a State can by an international
convention be restricted to a mercantile flag only, such
State being prevented from having a navy. This is
the position of Montenegro<a id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_511_511">[511]</a> according to article 29 of
the Treaty of Berlin of 1878.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_511_511"></a><a href="#FNanchor_511_511" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[511]</span></a> See
 above, § <a href="#Just_like_independence127" class="pginternal">127</a>, but it is doubtful whether this
restriction is still in existence, since article 29 has, after the
annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina by Austria in 1908, been modified
by the Powers, so that the port of Antivari and the other Montenegrin
waters are now no longer closed to men-of-war of all nations. See R.G.
XVII. (1910), pp. 173-176.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Rationale for the Freedom of the Open Sea.</p></div>
<p>§ 259. <a id="Grotius_and_many_writers259"></a>Grotius and many writers who follow<a id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_512_512">[512]</a> him
establish two facts as the reason for the freedom of
the Open Sea. They maintain, first, that a part of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
the Open Sea could not effectively be occupied by a
Navy and could therefore not be brought under the
actual sway of any State. And they assert, secondly,
that Nature does not give a right to anybody to appropriate
such things as may inoffensively be used by
everybody and are inexhaustible, and, therefore, sufficient
for all.<a id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_513_513">[513]</a> The last argument has nowadays hardly
any value, especially for those who have freed themselves
from the fanciful rules of the so-called Law of
Nature. And the first argument is now without basis
in face of the development of the modern navies, since
the number of public vessels which the different States
possess at present would enable many a State to occupy
effectively one part or another of the Open Sea. The
real reason for the freedom of the Open Sea is represented
in the motive which led to the attack against
maritime sovereignty, and in the purpose for which
such attack was made—namely, the freedom of communication,
and especially commerce, between the
States which are severed by the Sea. The Sea being
an international highway which connects distant lands,
it is the common conviction that it should not be under
the sway of any State whatever. It is in the interest
of free intercourse<a id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_514_514">[514]</a> between the States that the principle
of the freedom of the Open Sea has become universally
recognised and will always be upheld.<a id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_515_515">[515]</a></p>

whole or on certain parts of the Open Sea. See Pradier-Fodéré, II. Nos.

<p>§ 260. <a id="Jurisdiction_on_the_Open_Sea260"></a>Jurisdiction on the Open Sea is in the main
connected with the maritime flag under which vessels
sail. This is the consequence of the fact stated above<a id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_516_516">[516]</a>
that a certain legal order is created on the Open Sea
through the co-operation of rules of the Law of Nations
with rules of the Municipal Laws of such States as
possess a maritime flag. But two points must be emphasised.
The one is that this jurisdiction is not jurisdiction
over the Open Sea as such, but only over vessels,
persons, and goods on the Open Sea. And the other
is that jurisdiction on the Open Sea is, although mainly,
not exclusively connected with the flag under which
vessels sail, because men-of-war of all nations have,
as will be seen,<a id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_517_517">[517]</a> certain powers over merchantmen of
all nations. The points which must therefore be here
discussed singly are—the claim of vessels to sail under
a certain flag, ship-papers, the names of vessels, the
connection of vessels with the territory of the flag
State, the safety of traffic on the Open Sea, the powers

<p>§ 261. <a id="Th261"></a>The Law of Nations does not include any
rules regarding the claim of vessels to sail under a
certain maritime flag, but imposes the duty upon every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
State having a maritime flag to stipulate by its own
Municipal Laws the conditions to be fulfilled by those
vessels which wish to sail under its flag. In the interest
of order on the Open Sea, a vessel not sailing under the
maritime flag of a State enjoys no protection whatever,
for the freedom of navigation on the Open Sea is freedom
for such vessels only as sail under the flag of a
State. But a State is absolutely independent in framing
the rules concerning the claim of vessels to its flag.
It can in especial authorise such vessels to sail under
its flag as are the property of foreign subjects; but
such foreign vessels sailing under its flag fall thereby
under its jurisdiction. The different States have made
different rules concerning the sailing of vessels under
their flags.<a id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_518_518">[518]</a> Some, as Great Britain<a id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_519_519">[519]</a> and Germany,
allow only such vessels to sail under their flags as are
the exclusive property of their citizens or of corporations
established on their territory. Others, as Argentina,
admit vessels which are the property of foreigners.
Others again, as France, admit vessels which are in
part the property of French citizens.<a id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_520_520">[520]</a></p>

rules concerning the sailing of merchantmen under the maritime flag of a
State under the heading:—"<i>Règles relatives à l'usage du pavillon
national pour les navires de commerce</i>."</p></div>
<p>But no State can allow such vessel to sail under its
flag as already sails under the flag of another State.
Just as a vessel not sailing under the flag of a State,
so a vessel sailing under the flags of two different States
does not enjoy any protection whatever. Nor is protection
enjoyed by such vessel as sails under the flag of
a State which, like Switzerland, has no maritime flag.
Vessels belonging to persons who are subjects of States
without a maritime flag must obtain authority to sail<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
under some other State's flag, if they wish to enjoy
protection on the Open Sea. And any vessel, although
the property of foreigners, which sails without authority
under the flag of a State, may be captured by the men-of-war
of such State, prosecuted, punished, and confiscated.<a id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_521_521">[521]</a></p>

 Holland, "Manual of Naval Prize Law," §§ 178-194, where
the papers required by the different maritime States are enumerated.</p></div>
<p>(1) An official voucher authorising the vessel to sail
under its flag. This voucher consists of a Certificate of
Registry, in case the flag State possesses, like Great
Britain and Germany for instance, a register of its
mercantile marine; in other cases the voucher consists
of a "Passport," "Sea-letter," "Sea-brief," or of some
other document serving the purpose of showing the
vessel's nationality.</p>

of the crew, their nationality, and the like.</p>

who lets it wholly or in part, and the charterer, the
person who hires it.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Names of Vessels.</p></div>
<p>§ 263. Every State must register the names of all
private vessels sailing under its flag, and it must make
them bear their names visibly, so that every vessel
may be identified from a distance. No vessel must be
allowed to change her name without permission and
fresh registration.<a id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_523_523">[523]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Territorial Quality of Vessels on the Open Sea.</p></div>
<p>§ 264. <a id="It_is_a_customary264"></a>It is a customary rule of the Law of Nations
that men-of-war and other public vessels of any State
are, whilst on the Open Sea as well as in foreign territorial
waters, in every point considered as though they
were floating parts of their home States.<a id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_524_524">[524]</a> Private
vessels are only considered as though they were floating
portions of the flag State in so far as they remain whilst
on the Open Sea in principle under the exclusive jurisdiction
of the flag State. Thus the birth of a child, a
will or business contract made, a crime<a id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_525_525">[525]</a> committed on
board ship, and the like, are considered as happening
on the territory and therefore under the territorial
supremacy of the flag<a id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_526_526">[526]</a> State. But although they
appear in this respect as though they were, private
vessels are in fact not floating portions of the flag State.
For in time of war belligerent men-of-war can visit,
search, and capture neutral private vessels on the Open
Sea for breach of blockade, contraband, and the like,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>

for the purpose of preventing collisions, saving lives
after collisions, and the like, but every State possessing
a maritime flag has legislated for the conduct on
the Open Sea of vessels sailing under its flag concerning
signalling, piloting, courses, collisions, and the like.
Although every State can legislate on these matters
independently of other States, more and more corresponding
rules have been put into force by all the States
during the second half of the nineteenth century, following
the lead given by Great Britain through section 25
of the Merchant Shipping Act Amendment Act of 1862,
the "Regulations for preventing Collisions at Sea"
which accompany this Act, and, further, Sections 16
to 20 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1873.<a id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_529_529">[529]</a> And the
"Commercial Code of Signals for the Use of all Nations,"
published by Great Britain in 1857, has been adopted
by all maritime States. In 1889 a maritime Conference
took place at Washington, at which eighteen maritime
States were represented and which recommended a
body of rules for preventing collisions at sea to be
adopted by the single States,<a id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_530_530">[530]</a> and a revision of the
Code of Signals. These regulations were revised in
1890 by a British Committee appointed by the Board<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
of Trade,<a id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_531_531">[531]</a> and, after some direct negotiations between
the Governments, most maritime States have made
corresponding regulations by their Municipal Laws.<a id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_532_532">[532]</a>
And a new and revised edition of "The International
Code of Signals" was published by the British Board
of Trade, in conformity with arrangements with
other maritime Powers, in 1900, and is now in
general use.<a id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_533_533">[533]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_528_528"></a><a href="#FNanchor_528_528" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[528]</span></a> It is to be expected that matters will soon undergo a
change, for the Conference of the International Maritime Committee,
which met at Brussels in September 1910 and where all the maritime
States of Europe, the United States of America, most of the South
American States, and Japan were represented, produced a draft convention
concerning collisions (see Supplement to the <i>American Journal of
International Law</i>, IV. (1910), p. 121). The "Maritime Conventions
Bill," which is now before Parliament, proposes such alterations of
British Municipal Law as would enable the British Government to ratify
this Convention. The Institute of International Law already in 1888, at
its meeting at Lausanne—see Annuaire, X. (1889), p. 150—adopted a body
of eight rules concerning the subject.</p></div>

Prien, "Der Zusammenstoss von Schiffen nach dem Gesetzen des Erdhalls"

<p>The question of jurisdiction in actions for damages
for collision at sea is not at all settled.<a id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_534_534">[534]</a> That the damaged
innocent vessel can bring an action against the
guilty ship in the Courts of the latter's flag State is
beyond doubt since jurisdiction on the Open Sea follows
the flag. If the rule that all vessels while on the Open
Sea are considered under the sway of their flag State
were one without exception, no other State would claim
jurisdiction in cases of collision but the flag State of the
guilty ship. Yet the practice of the maritime States<a id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_535_535">[535]</a>
goes far beyond this, without, however, being uniform.
Thus, for instance, France<a id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_536_536">[536]</a> claims jurisdiction if the
damaged ship is French, although the guilty ship may
be foreign, and also in the event of both ships being
foreign in case both consent, or for urgent measures
having a provisionary character, or in case France is a
place of payment. Thus, further, Italy<a id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_537_537">[537]</a> claims jurisdiction
even if both ships are foreign in case an Italian
port is the port nearest to the collision, or in case the
damaged ship was forced by the collision to remain in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
an Italian port. Great Britain goes farthest, for the
Admiralty Court claims jurisdiction provided the guilty
ship is in a British port at the time the action for damages
is brought, even if the collision took place between
two foreign ships anywhere on the High Seas.<a id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_538_538">[538]</a> And the
Admiralty Court justifies this extended claim of jurisdiction<a id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_539_539">[539]</a>
by maintaining that collision is a matter of
<i>communis juris</i>, and can therefore be adjudicated upon
by the Courts<a id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_540_540">[540]</a> of all maritime States.<a id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_541_541">[541]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Powers of Men-of-war over Merchantmen of all Nations.</p></div>
<p>§ 266. <a id="Although_the_freedom266"></a>Although the freedom of the Open Sea and
the fact that vessels on the Open Sea remain under the
jurisdiction of the flag State exclude as a rule the exercise
of any State's authority over foreign vessels, there
are certain exceptions in the interest of all maritime
nations. These exceptions are the following:—</p>
<p>(1) Blockade and Contraband. In time of war
belligerents can blockade not only enemy ports and
territorial coast waters, but also parts of the Open Sea
adjoining those ports and waters, and neutral merchantmen
attempting to break such a blockade can be confiscated.
And, further, in time of war belligerent
men-of-war can visit, search, and eventually seize
neutral merchantmen for contraband, and the like.</p>
<p>(2) <a id="Ve2of266"></a>Verification of Flag. It is a universally recognised
customary rule of International Law that men-of-war
of all nations have, to maintain the safety of
the Open Sea against piracy, the power to require suspicious
private vessels on the Open Sea to show their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
flag.<a id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_542_542">[542]</a> But such vessels must be suspicious, and, since
a vessel may be a pirate although she shows a flag, she
may eventually be stopped and visited for the purpose
of inspecting her papers and thereby verifying the flag.
It is, however, quite obvious that this power of men-of-war
must not be abused, and that the home State is
responsible for damages in case a man-of-war stops and
visits a foreign merchantman without sufficient ground
of suspicion. The right of every State to punish piracy
on the Open Sea will be treated below, §§ 272-280.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_542_542"></a><a href="#FNanchor_542_542" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[542]</span></a> So-called "Droit d'enquête" or "Vérification du pavillon."
This power of men-of-war has given occasion to much dispute and
discussion, but in fact nobody denies that in case of grave suspicion
this power does exist. See Twiss, I. § 193; Hall, § 81, p. 276; Fiore,
II. Nos. 732-736; Perels, § 17; Taylor, § 266; Bonfils, No. 519.</p></div>
<p>(3) So-called Right of Pursuit. It is a universally
recognised customary rule that men-of-war of a littoral
State can pursue into the Open Sea, seize, and bring
back into a port for trial any foreign merchantman
that has violated the law whilst in the territorial waters
of the State in question. But such pursuit into the
Open Sea is permissible only if commenced while the
merchantman is still in the said territorial waters or
has only just escaped thence, and the pursuit must stop
as soon as the merchantman passes into the maritime
belt of a foreign State.<a id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_543_543">[543]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_543_543"></a><a href="#FNanchor_543_543" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[543]</span></a> See
 Hall, § 80.</p></div>
<p>(4) Abuse of Flag. It is another universally recognised
rule that men-of-war of every State may seize
and bring to a port of their own for punishment any
foreign vessel sailing under the flag of such State without
authority.<a id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_544_544">[544]</a> Accordingly, Great Britain has, by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
section 69 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, enacted:—"If
a person uses the British flag and assumes the
British national character on board a ship owned in
whole or in part by any persons not qualified to own a
British ship, for the purpose of making the ship appear
a British ship, the ship shall be subject to forfeiture
under this Act, unless the assumption has been made
for the purpose of escaping capture by an enemy or by
a foreign ship of war in the exercise of some belligerent
right."</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_544_544"></a><a href="#FNanchor_544_544" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[544]</span></a> The four exceptions mentioned in the text above are based
on universally recognised customary rules of the Law of Nations. It is,
of course, possible for several States to enter into treaty agreements
according to which their men-of-war acquire certain powers over each
other's merchantmen on the Open Sea. According to such agreements, which
are, however, not universal, the following additional exceptions may be
enumerated:—
</p><p>
(1) In the interest of the suppression of the slave trade, the signatory
Powers of the General Act of the Brussels Conference of 1890 to which
all the larger maritime Powers belong, have, by articles 20-65,
stipulated that their men-of-war shall have the power, in certain parts
of the Open Sea where slave traffic still continues, to stop every
suspect vessel under 500 tons.
</p><p>
(2) In the interest of the Fisheries in the North Sea, special cruisers
of the littoral Powers control all fishing vessels and bumboats. See
 below, §§ <a href="#For_the_purpose_of_regulating_the_fisheries282" class="pginternal">282</a>
 and <a href="#Connected_with_the_regulation283" class="pginternal">283</a>.
</p><p>
(3) In the interest of Transatlantic telegraph cables, men-of-war of the
signatory Powers of the treaty for the protection of such cables have
certain powers over merchantmen. (See
 below, § <a href="#Page_287" class="pginternal">287</a>.)</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>How Verification of Flag is effected.</p></div>
<p>§ 267. A man-of-war which meets a suspicious
merchantman not showing her colours and wishes to
verify the same, hoists her own flag and fires a blank
cartridge. This is a signal for the other vessel to hoist
her flag in reply. If she takes no notice of the signal,
the man-of-war fires a shot across her bows. If the
suspicious vessel, in spite of this warning, still declines to
hoist her flag, the suspicion becomes so grave that the
man-of-war may compel her to bring to for the purpose
of visiting her and thereby verifying her nationality.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>How Visit is effected.</p></div>
<p>§ 268. <a id="Th268"></a>The intention to visit may be communicated
to a merchantman either by hailing or by the "informing
gun"—that is, by firing either one or two
blank cartridges. If the vessel takes no notice of this
communication, a shot may be fired across her bows
as a signal to bring to, and, if this also has no effect,
force may be resorted to. After the vessel has been
brought to, either an officer is sent on board for the
purpose of inspecting her papers, or her master is
ordered to bring his ship papers for inspection on board
the man-of-war. If the inspection proves the papers to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
in order, a memorandum of the visit is made in the log-book,
and the vessel is allowed to proceed on her course.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>How Search is effected.</p></div>
<p>§ 269. <a id="Se269"></a>Search is naturally a measure which visit
must always precede. It is because the visit has given
no satisfaction that search is instituted. Search is
effected by an officer and some of the crew of the man-of-war,
the master and crew of the vessel to be searched
not being compelled to render any assistance whatever
except to open locked cupboards and the like. The search
must take place in an orderly way, and no damage must
be done to the cargo. If the search proves everything
to be in order, the searchers have carefully to replace
everything removed, a memorandum of the search is
to be made in the log-book, and the searched vessel
is to be allowed to proceed on her course.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>How Arrest is effected.</p></div>
<p>§ 270. Arrest of a vessel takes place either after
visit and search have shown her liable thereto, or after
she has committed some act which alone already justifies
her seizure. Arrest is effected through the commander
of the arresting man-of-war appointing one of
her officers and a part of her crew to take charge of the
arrested vessel. Such officer is responsible for the
vessel and her cargo, which latter must be kept safe
and intact. The arrested vessel, either accompanied by
the arresting vessel or not, must be brought to such
harbour as is determined by the cause of the arrest.
Thus, neutral or enemy ships seized in time of war are
always<a id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_545_545">[545]</a> to be brought into a harbour of the flag State
of the captor. And the same is the case in time of
peace, when a vessel is seized because her flag cannot
be verified, or because she was sailing under no flag at
all. On the other hand, when a fishing vessel or a
bumboat is arrested in the North Sea, she is always to
be brought into a harbour of her flag State and handed
over to the authorities there.<a id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_546_546">[546]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_545_545"></a><a href="#FNanchor_545_545" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[545]</span></a> Except in the case of distress or unseaworthiness; see

<p>§ 271. <a id="It_is_at_present271"></a>It is at present the universal conviction on

on the Open Sea do not thereby lose the protection

No State is allowed to recognise appropriation of abandoned

those of its subjects who take possession thereof. But

Court—see the case of the <i>Johann Friederich</i>, 1 W. Robinson,
35—salvage on the Open Sea is, just like collisions, a matter of
<i>communis juris</i> upon which the Courts of all maritime States are
competent to adjudicate. See Phillimore, IV. § 815; and Dicey, "Conflict

to say that there is a customary or conventional
rule of the Law of Nations in existence which imposes
upon all States the duty of instructing their men-of-war
to render assistance to foreign vessels in distress, although
many States order by Municipal Regulations
their men-of-war to render such assistance, and although
morally every vessel is bound to render assistance to
another vessel in distress.<a id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_549_549">[549]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Conception of Piracy.</p></div>
<p>§ 272. Piracy, in its original and strict meaning, is
every unauthorised act of violence committed by a
private vessel on the Open Sea against another vessel
with intent to plunder (<i>animo furandi</i>). The majority
of writers confine piracy to such acts, which indeed are
the normal cases of piracy. But there are cases possible
which are not covered by this narrow definition,
and yet they are practically treated as though they
were cases of piracy. Thus, if the members of the crew
revolt and convert the ship and the goods thereon to
their own use, they are considered to be pirates, although
they have not committed an act of violence
against another ship. Thus, secondly, if unauthorised
acts of violence, such as murder of persons on board the
attacked vessel or destruction of goods thereon, are
committed on the Open Sea without intent to plunder,
such acts are practically considered to be piratical.
Under these circumstances several writers,<a id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_550_550">[550]</a> correctly,
I think, oppose the usual definition of piracy as an act
of violence committed by a private vessel against another
with intent to plunder. But no unanimity exists
among these very writers concerning a fit definition of
piracy, and the matter is therefore very controversial.
If a definition is desired which really covers all such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
acts as are practically treated as piratical, piracy must
be defined as <i>every unauthorised act of violence against
persons or goods committed on the Open Sea either by a
private vessel against another vessel or by the mutinous
crew or passengers against their own vessel</i>.<a id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_551_551">[551]</a></p>

26; Calvo, § 485.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_551_551"></a><a href="#FNanchor_551_551" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[551]</span></a> The conception of Piracy is discussed in the case of the
Republic of Bolivia <i>v.</i> The Indemnity Mutual Marine Assurance Co., L.R.
(1909), 1 K.B., 785.</p></div>
<p>Already, before a Law of Nations in the modern
sense of the term was in existence, a pirate was considered
an outlaw, a "hostis humani generis." According
to the Law of Nations the act of piracy makes the
pirate lose the protection of his home State, and thereby
his national character; and his vessel, although she
may formerly have possessed a claim to sail under a
certain State's flag, loses such claim. Piracy is a so-called
"international crime";<a id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_552_552">[552]</a> the pirate is considered
the enemy of every State, and can be brought to justice
anywhere.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_552_552"></a><a href="#FNanchor_552_552" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[552]</span></a> See

<div class="sidenote"><p>Private Ships as Subjects of Piracy.</p></div>
<p>§ 273. <a id="Private_vessels273"></a>Private vessels only<a id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_553_553">[553]</a> can commit piracy. A
man-of-war or other public ship, as long as she remains
such, is never a pirate. If she commits unjustified acts
of violence, redress must be asked from her flag State,
which has to punish the commander and to pay damages
where required. But if a man-of-war or other
public ship of a State revolts and cruises the sea for her
own purposes, she ceases to be a public ship, and acts
of violence now committed by her are indeed piratical
acts. A <i>privateer</i> is not a pirate as long as her acts of
violence are confined to enemy vessels, because such
acts are authorised by the belligerent in whose services
she is acting. And it matters not that the privateer is
originally a neutral vessel.<a id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_554_554">[554]</a> But if a neutral vessel
were to take Letters of Marque from both belligerents,
she would be considered a pirate.</p>

<p>Doubtful is the case where a privateer in a civil war
has received her Letters of Marque from the insurgents,
and, further, the case where during a civil war
men-of-war join the insurgents before the latter have
been recognised as a belligerent Power. It is evident
that the legitimate Government will treat such ships
as pirates; but third Powers ought not to do so, as
long as these vessels do not commit any act of violence
against ships of these third Powers. Thus, in 1873,
when an insurrection broke out in Spain, Spanish men-of-war
stationed at Carthagena fell into the hands of
the insurgents, and the Spanish Government proclaimed
these vessels pirates, England, France, and Germany
instructed the commanders of their men-of-war in the
Mediterranean not to interfere as long as these insurgent
vessels<a id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_555_555">[555]</a> abstained from acts of violence against the
lives and property of their subjects.<a id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_556_556">[556]</a> On the other
hand, when in 1877 a revolutionary outbreak occurred
at Callao in Peru and the ironclad <i>Huascar</i>, which had
been seized by the insurgents, put to sea, stopped
British steamers, took a supply of coal without payment
from one of these, and forcibly took two Peruvian
officials from on board another where they were passengers,
she was justly considered a pirate and
attacked by the British Admiral de Horsey, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
was in command of the British squadron in the
Pacific.<a id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_557_557">[557]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_555_555"></a><a href="#FNanchor_555_555" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[555]</span></a> See
 Calvo, I. §§ 497-501; Hall, § 82; Westlake, I. pp.
179-182.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_556_556"></a><a href="#FNanchor_556_556" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[556]</span></a> But in the American case of the <i>Ambrose Light</i> (25 Federal
408; see also Moore, II. § 332, p. 1098) the Court did not agree with
this. The <i>Ambrose Light</i> was a brigantine which, when on April 24,
1885, she was sighted by Commander Clark of the U.S.S. <i>Alliance</i> in the
Caribbean Sea, was flying a strange flag showing a red cross on a white
ground, but she afterwards hoisted the Columbian flag; when seized she
was found to carry sixty armed soldiers, one cannon, and a considerable
quantity of ammunition. She bore a commission from Columbian insurgents,
and was designed to assist in the blockade of the port of Carthagena by
the rebels. Commander Clark considered the vessel to be a pirate and
sent her in for condemnation. The Court held that in absence of any
recognition of the Columbian insurgents as a belligerent Power the
<i>Ambrose Light</i> had been lawfully seized as a pirate. The vessel was,
however, nevertheless released because the American Secretary of State
had recognised by implication a state of war between the insurgents and
the legitimate Columbian Government.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_557_557"></a><a href="#FNanchor_557_557" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[557]</span></a> As regards the case of the Argentinian vessel <i>Porteña</i> and
the Spanish vessel <i>Montezuma</i>, afterwards called <i>Cespedes</i>, see Calvo,
I. §§ 502 and 503.</p></div>
<p>The case must also be mentioned of a privateer or
man-of-war which after the conclusion of peace or the
termination of war by subjugation and the like continues
to commit hostile acts. If such vessel is not
cognisant of the fact that the war has come to an end
she cannot be considered as a pirate. Thus the Confederate
cruiser <i>Shenandoah</i>, which in 1865, for some
months after the end of the American Civil War, attacked
American vessels, was not considered a pirate<a id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_558_558">[558]</a> by the
British Government when her commander gave her up
to the port authorities at Liverpool in November 1865,
because he asserted that he had not known till August
of the termination of the war, and that he had abstained
from hostilities as soon as he had obtained this
information.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_558_558"></a><a href="#FNanchor_558_558" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[558]</span></a> See
 Lawrence, § 102.</p></div>
<p>It must be emphasised that the motive and the
purpose of such acts of violence do not alter their
piratical character, since the intent to plunder (<i>animus
furandi</i>) is not required. Thus, for instance, if a private
neutral vessel without Letters of Marque during war
out of hatred of one of the belligerents were to attack
and to sink vessels of such belligerent without plundering
at all, she would nevertheless be considered as a
pirate.<a id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_559_559">[559]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_559_559"></a><a href="#FNanchor_559_559" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[559]</span></a> This statement is correct in spite of art. 46, No. 1, of
the Declaration of London; see
 below, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41047/41047-h/41047-h.htm#In_contradistinction410" class="pgexternal" id="id-198255851091316970">vol. II. § 410</a>, No. 1.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Mutinous Crew and Passengers as Subjects of Piracy.</p></div>
<p>§ 274. The crew or the whole or a part of the passengers
who revolt on the Open Sea and convert the
vessel and her goods to their own use, commit thereby
piracy, whether the vessel is private or public. But a
simple act of violence alone on the part of crew or
passengers does not constitute in itself the crime of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
piracy, at least not as far as International Law is concerned.
If, for instance, the crew were to murder the
master on account of his cruelty and afterwards carry
on the voyage, they would be murderers, but not pirates.
They are pirates only when the revolt is directed not
merely against the master, but also against the vessel,
for the purpose of converting her and her goods to
their own use.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Object of Piracy.</p></div>
<p>§ 275. The object of piracy is any public or private
vessel, or the persons or the goods thereon, whilst on
the Open Sea. In the regular case of piracy the pirate
wants to make booty; it is the cargo of the attacked
vessel which is the centre of his interest, and he might
free the vessel and the crew after having appropriated
the cargo. But he remains a pirate whether he does so
or kills the crew and appropriates the ship, or sinks her.
On the other hand, it does not matter if the cargo is
not the object of his act of violence. If he stops a
vessel and takes a rich passenger off with the intention
to keep him for the purpose of a high ransom, his act
is piracy. It is likewise piracy if he stops a vessel for
the purpose of killing a certain person only on board,
although he may afterwards free vessel, crew, and cargo.</p>
<p>That a possible object of piracy is not only another
vessel, but also the very ship on which the crew and
passenger navigate, is an inference from the statements
above in § 274.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Piracy, how effected.</p></div>
<p>§ 276. Piracy is effected by any unauthorised act of
violence, be it direct application of force or intimidation
through menace. The crew or passengers who, for
the purpose of converting a vessel and her goods to
their own use, force the master through intimidation
to steer another course, commit piracy as well as those
who murder the master and steer the vessel themselves.
And a ship which, through the threat to sink her
if she should refuse, forces another ship to deliver up<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
her cargo or a person on board, commits piracy as well
as the ship which attacks another vessel, kills her crew,
and thereby gets hold of her cargo or a person on board.</p>
<p>The act of violence need not be consummated to
constitute the crime of piracy. The mere attempt, such
as attacking or even chasing only for the purpose of
attack, by itself comprises piracy. On the other hand,
it is doubtful whether persons cruising in armed vessels
with the intention of committing piracies are liable to
be treated as pirates before they have committed a
single act of violence.<a id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_560_560">[560]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_560_560"></a><a href="#FNanchor_560_560" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[560]</span></a> See
 Stephen, "Digest of the Criminal Law," article 104. In
the case of the <i>Ambrose Light</i>—see
 above, § <a href="#Private_vessels273" class="pginternal">273</a>—the Court considered
the vessel to be a pirate, although no attempt to commit a piratical act
had been made by her.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Where Piracy can be committed.</p></div>
<p>§ 277. Piracy as an "international crime" can be
committed on the Open Sea only. Piracy in territorial
coast waters has quite as little to do with International
Law as other robberies on the territory of a State. Some
writers<a id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_561_561">[561]</a> maintain that piracy need not necessarily be
committed on the Open Sea, but that it suffices that the
respective acts of violence are committed by descent
from the Open Sea. They maintain, therefore, that
if "a body of pirates land on an island unappropriated
by a civilised Power, and rob and murder a trader who
may be carrying on commerce there with the savage
inhabitants, they are guilty of a crime possessing all
the marks of commonplace professional piracy." With
this opinion I cannot agree. Piracy is, and always has
been, a crime against the safety of traffic on the Open
Sea, and therefore it cannot be committed anywhere
else than on the Open Sea.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Jurisdiction over Pirates, and their Punishment.</p></div>
<p>§ 278. <a id="A_pirate_and278"></a>A pirate and his vessel lose <i>ipso facto</i> by an
act of piracy the protection of their flag State and their
national character. Every maritime State has by a
customary rule of the Law of Nations the right to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
punish pirates. And the vessels of all nations, whether
men-of-war, other public vessels, or merchantmen,<a id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_562_562">[562]</a> can
on the Open Sea<a id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_563_563">[563]</a> chase, attack, seize, and bring the
pirate home for trial and punishment by the Courts of
their own country. In former times it was said to be
a customary rule of International Law that pirates
could at once after seizure be hanged or drowned by the
captor. But this cannot now be upheld, although some
writers assert that it is still the law. It would seem
that the captor may execute pirates on the spot only
when he is not able to bring them safely into a port for
trial; but Municipal Law may, of course, interdict such
execution. Concerning the punishment for piracy, the
Law of Nations lays down the rule that it may be
capital. But it need not be, the Municipal Law of the
different States being competent to order any less severe
punishment. Nor does the Law of Nations make it a
duty for every maritime State to punish all pirates.<a id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_564_564">[564]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_562_562"></a><a href="#FNanchor_562_562" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[562]</span></a> A few writers (Gareis in Holtzendorff, II. p 575; Liszt, §
26; Ullmann, § 104; Stiel, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 51) maintain, however, that
men-of-war only have the power to seize the pirate.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_563_563"></a><a href="#FNanchor_563_563" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[563]</span></a> If a pirate is chased on the Open Sea and flees into the
territorial maritime belt, the pursuers may follow, attack, and arrest
the pirate there; but they must give him up to the authorities of the
littoral State.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_564_564"></a><a href="#FNanchor_564_564" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[564]</span></a> Thus, according to the German Criminal Code, piracy
committed by foreigners against foreign vessels cannot be punished by
German Courts (see Perels, § 17). From article 104 of Stephen's "Digest
of the Criminal Law," there seems to be no doubt that, according to
English Law, all pirates are liable to be punished. See Stiel, <i>op.
cit.</i>, p. 15, note 4, where a survey is given of the Municipal Law of
many States concerning this point.</p></div>
<p>That men-of-war of all nations have, with a view to
insuring the safety of traffic, the power of verifying the
flags of suspicious merchantmen of all nations, has
already been stated
 above (§ <a href="#Ve2of266" class="pginternal">266, No. 2</a>).</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p><i>Pirata non mutat dominium.</i></p></div>
<p>§ 279. The question as to the property in the seized
piratical vessels and the goods thereon has been the
subject of much controversy. During the seventeenth
century the practice of several States conceded such
vessel and goods to the captor as a premium. But
during the eighteenth century the rule <i>pirata non mutat <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
 dominium</i> became more and more recognised. Nowadays
the conviction would seem to be general that
ship and goods have to be restored to their proprietors,
and may be conceded to the captor only when the real
ownership cannot be ascertained. In the first case,
however, a certain percentage of the value is very often
conceded to the captor as a premium and an equivalent
for his expenses (so-called <i>droit de recousse</i><a id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_565_565">[565]</a>). Thus,
according to British Law,<a id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_566_566">[566]</a> a salvage of 12-1/2 per cent.
is to be paid to the captor of the pirate.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Piracy according to Municipal Law.</p></div>
<p>§ 280. Piracy, according to the Law of Nations,
which has been defined above (§ 272) as every unauthorised
act of violence against persons or goods
committed on the Open Sea either by a private vessel
against another vessel or by the mutinous crew or
passengers against their own vessel, must not be confounded
with the conception of piracy according to the
different Municipal Laws.<a id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_567_567">[567]</a> The several States may confine
themselves to punishing as piracy a narrower circle
of acts of violence than that which the Law of Nations
defines as piracy. On the other hand, they may punish
their subjects as pirates for a much wider circle of acts.
Thus, for instance, according to the Criminal Law of
England,<a id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_568_568">[568]</a> every English subject is <i>inter alia</i> deemed to
be a pirate who gives aid or comfort upon the sea to
the King's enemies during a war, or who transports
slaves on the High Seas.</p>

104-117.</p></div>
<p>However, since a State cannot on the Open Sea
enforce its Municipal Laws against others than its own
subjects, no State can treat such foreign subjects on
the Open Sea as pirates as are not pirates according<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
to the Law of Nations. Thus, when in 1858, before
the abolition of slavery in America, British men-of-war
molested American vessels suspected of carrying slaves,
the United States objected and rightly complained.<a id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_569_569">[569]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Fisheries in the Open Sea free to all Nations.</p></div>
<p>§ 281. Whereas the fisheries in the territorial maritime
belt can be reserved by the littoral State for its
own subjects, it is an inference of the freedom of the
Open Sea that the fisheries thereon are open<a id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_570_570">[570]</a> to vessels<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
of all nations. Since, however, vessels remain whilst
on the Open Sea under the jurisdiction of their flag
State, every State possessing a maritime flag can legislate
concerning the exercise of fisheries on the Open
Sea on the part of vessels sailing under its flag. And
for the same reason a State can by an international
agreement renounce its fisheries on certain parts of the
Open Sea, and accordingly interdict its vessels from
exercising fisheries there. If certain circumstances and
conditions make it advisable to restrict and regulate
the fisheries on some parts of the Open Sea, the Powers
are therefore able to create restrictions and regulations
for that purpose through international treaties. Such
treaties have been concluded—first, with regard to the
fisheries in the North Sea and the suppression of the
liquor trade among the fishing vessels in that Sea;
secondly, with regard to the seal fisheries in the Behring
Sea; thirdly, with regard to the fisheries around the
Faröe Islands and Iceland.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_570_570"></a><a href="#FNanchor_570_570" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[570]</span></a> Denmark silently, by fishing regulations of 1872, dropped
her claim to an exclusive right of fisheries within twenty miles of the
coast of Iceland; see Hall, § 40, p. 153, note 2. Russia promulgated, in
1911, a statute forbidding the fisheries to foreign vessels within
twelve miles of the shore of the White Sea, but the Powers protested
against this encroachment upon the freedom of the Open Sea; the matter
is still unsettled.
</p><p>
A case of a particular kind would seem to be the pearl fishery off
Ceylon, which extends to a distance of twenty miles from the shore and
for which regulations exist which are enforced against foreign as well
as British subjects. The claim on which these regulations are based is
one "to the products of certain submerged portions of land which have
been treated from time immemorial by the successive rulers of the island
as subject of property and jurisdiction." See Hall, "Foreign Powers and
Jurisdiction" (1894), p. 243, note 1. See also Westlake, I. p. 186, who
says: "The case of the pearl fishery is peculiar, the pearls being
obtained from the sea bottom by divers, so that it has a physical
connection with the stable element of the locality which is wanting to
the pursuit of fish swimming in the water. When carried on under State
protection, as that off the British island of Ceylon, or that in the
Persian Gulf which is protected by British ships in pursuance of
treaties with certain chiefs of the Arabian mainland, it may be regarded
as an occupation of the bed of the sea. In that character the pearl
fishery will be territorial even though the shallowness of the water may
allow it to be practised beyond the limit which the State in question
generally fixes for the littoral seas, as in the case of Ceylon it is
practised beyond the three miles limit generally recognised by Great
Britain. 'Qui doutera,' says Vattel (I. § 28), 'que les pêcheries de
Bahrein et de Ceylon ne puissent légitimement tomber en propriété?' And
the territorial nature of the industry will carry with it, as being
necessary for its protection, the territorial character of the spot."
This opinion of Westlake coincides with that contended by Great Britain
during the Behring Sea Arbitration; see Parliamentary Papers, United
States, No. 4 (1893) Behring Sea Arbitration, Archives of His Majesty's
Government, pp. 51 and 59. But it is submitted that the bed of the Open
Sea is not a possible object of occupation. The explanation of the pearl
fisheries off Ceylon and in the Persian Gulf being exclusively British
is to be found in the fact that the freedom of the Open Sea was not a
rule of International Law when these fisheries were taken possession of.

obligations undertaken by her in the Convention for the regulation of
the fisheries in the North Sea, Great Britain enacted in 1883 the "Act
to carry into effect an International Convention concerning the
Fisheries in the North Sea, and to amend the Laws relating to British
Sea Fisheries" (46 and 47 Vict. ch. 22).</p></div>
<p>(1) All the fishing vessels of the signatory Powers
must be registered, and the registers have to be exchanged
between the Powers (article 5). Every vessel
has to bear visibly in white colour on black ground its
number, name, and the name of its harbour (articles
6-11). Every vessel must bear an official voucher of
her nationality (articles 12-13).</p>
<p>(2) To avoid conflicts between the different fishing
vessels, very minute interdictions and injunctions are
provided (articles 14-25).</p>
<p>(3) The supervision of the fisheries by the fishing
vessels of the signatory Powers is exercised by special
cruisers of these Powers (article 26). With the exception
of those contraventions which are specially
enumerated by article 27, all these cruisers are competent
to verify all contraventions committed by the
fishing vessels of all the signatory Powers (article 28).
For that purpose they have the right of visit, search,
and arrest (article 29). But a seized fishing vessel is
to be brought into a harbour of her flag State and to
be handed over to the authorities there (article 30).
All contraventions are to be tried by the Courts of the
State to which the contravening vessels belong (article
36); but in cases of a trifling character the matter can
be compromised on the spot by the commanders of the
special public cruisers of the Powers (article 33).<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span></p>

<p>§ 283. <a id="Connected_with_the_regulation283"></a>Connected with the regulation of the fisheries
is the abolition of the liquor trade among the fishing
vessels in the North Sea. Since serious quarrels and
difficulties were caused through bumboats and floating
grog-shops selling intoxicating liquors to the fishermen,
an International Conference took place at the Hague
in 1886, where the signatory Powers of the Hague Convention
concerning the fisheries in the North Sea were
represented. And on November 16, 1887, the International
Convention concerning the Abolition of the
Liquor Traffic among the fishermen in the North Sea
was signed by the representatives of these Powers—namely,
Great Britain, Belgium, Denmark, France,
Germany, and Holland. This treaty<a id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_573_573">[573]</a> was, however,
not ratified until 1894, and France did not ratify it at

<p>It is interdicted to sell spirituous drinks to persons
on board of fishing vessels, and these persons are prohibited
from buying such drinks (article 2). Bumboats,
which wish to sell provisions to fishermen, must
be licensed by their flag State and must fly a white flag<a id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_575_575">[575]</a>
with the letter S in black in the middle (article 3). The
special cruisers of the Powers which supervise the
fisheries in the North Sea are likewise competent to
supervise the treaty stipulations concerning bumboats;
they have the right to ask for the production
of the proper licence, and eventually the right to arrest
the vessel (article 7). But arrested vessels must always
be brought into a harbour of their flag State, and all
contraventions are to be tried by Courts of the flag

<div class="sidenote"><p>Telegraph cables in the Open Sea admitted.</p></div>
<p>§ 286. <a id="It286"></a>It is a consequence of the freedom of the
Open Sea that no State can prevent another from laying
telegraph and telephone cables in any part of the Open
Sea, whereas no State need allow this within its territorial
maritime belt. As numerous submarine cables
have been laid, the question as to their protection arose.
Already in 1869 the United States proposed an international
convention for this purpose, but the matter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
dropped in consequence of the outbreak of the Franco-German
war. The Institute of International Law took
up the matter in 1879<a id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_583_583">[583]</a> and recommended an international
agreement. In 1882 France invited the Powers
to an International Conference at Paris for the purpose
of regulating the protection of submarine cables. This
conference met in October 1882, again in October 1883,
and produced the "International Convention for the
Protection of Submarine Telegraph Cables" which was
signed at Paris on April 16, 1884.<a id="FNanchor_584_584"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_584_584">[584]</a></p>

without regard to the particular system of radio-telegraphy
adopted by them (article 3). Each of the contracting
parties undertakes to cause its coast stations
to be connected with the telegraph system by means of
special wires, or at least to take such other measures as
will ensure an expeditious exchange of traffic between
the coast stations and the telegraph system (article 5).
Radio-telegraph stations are bound to accept with absolute
priority calls of distress from ships, to answer
such calls with similar priority, and to take the necessary
steps with regard to them (article 9). An International
Bureau shall be established with the duty of
collecting, arranging, and publishing information of
every kind concerning radio-telegraphy, and for some
other purposes mentioned in article 13.</p>

reach of the liner <i>Vaderland</i>, and inquired
by wireless telegraphy whether the <i>Vaderland</i> had seen

<span class="smaller">THE SUBSOIL BENEATH THE SEA BED</span>
</h4>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Five rules concerning the subsoil beneath the Sea Bed.</p></div>
<p>§ 287<i>c</i>. <a id="The_subsoil287c"></a>The subsoil beneath the bed of the Open Sea
requires special consideration on account of coal or
other mines, tunnels, and the like, for the question is
whether such buildings can be driven into that subsoil
at all, and, if this can be done, whether they can be
under the territorial supremacy of a particular State.
The answer depends entirely upon the character in law
of such subsoil. If the rules concerning the territorial
subsoil<a id="FNanchor_591_591"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_591_591">[591]</a> would have analogously to be applied to the
subsoil beneath the bed of the Open Sea, all rules concerning
the Open Sea would necessarily have to be
applied to the subsoil beneath its bed, and no part of
this subsoil could ever come under the territorial supremacy
of any State. It is, however, submitted<a id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_592_592">[592]</a> that it
would not be rational to consider the subsoil beneath<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
the bed of the Open Sea an inseparable appurtenance
of the latter, such as the subsoil beneath the territorial
land and water is. The rationale of the Open Sea
being free and for ever excluded from occupation on the
part of any State is that it is an international highway
which connects distant lands and thereby secures freedom
of communication, and especially of commerce,
between such States as are separated by the sea.<a id="FNanchor_593_593"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_593_593">[593]</a>
There is no reason whatever for extending this freedom
of the Open Sea to the subsoil beneath its bed. On the
contrary, there are practical reasons—taking into consideration
the building of mines, tunnels, and the like—which
compel the recognition of the fact that this
subsoil can be acquired through occupation. The following
five rules recommend themselves concerning
this subject:—</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_591_591"></a><a href="#FNanchor_591_591" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[591]</span></a> See
 above, §§ <a href="#The_subsoil173" class="pginternal">173</a>, 175.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_592_592"></a><a href="#FNanchor_592_592" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[592]</span></a> See
 Oppenheim in Z.V. II. (1908), p. 11.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_593_593"></a><a href="#FNanchor_593_593" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[593]</span></a> See
 above, § <a href="#Grotius_and_many_writers259" class="pginternal">259</a>.</p></div>
<p>(1) The subsoil beneath the bed of the Open Sea is
no man's land, and it can be acquired on the part of
a littoral State through occupation, starting from the
subsoil beneath the bed of the territorial maritime belt.</p>
<p>(2) This occupation takes place <i>ipso facto</i> by a tunnel
or a mine being driven from the shore through the subsoil
of the maritime belt into the subsoil of the Open Sea.</p>
<p>(3) This occupation of the subsoil of the Open Sea can
be extended up to the boundary line of the subsoil of
the territorial maritime belt of another State, for no
State has an exclusive claim to occupy such part of
the subsoil of the Open Sea as is adjacent to the subsoil
of its territorial maritime belt.</p>
<p>(4) An occupation of the subsoil beneath the bed of
the Open Sea for a purpose which would endanger the
freedom of the Open Sea is inadmissible.</p>
<p>(5) It is likewise inadmissible to make such arrangements
in a part of the subsoil beneath the Open Sea
which has previously been occupied for a legitimate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
purpose as would indirectly endanger the freedom of
the Open Sea.</p>
<p>If these five rules are correct, there is nothing in
the way of coal and other mines which are being exploited
on the shore of a littoral State being extended
into the subsoil beneath the Open Sea up to the boundary
line of the subsoil beneath the territorial maritime
belt of another State. Further, a tunnel which might
be built between such two parts of the same State—for
instance, between Ireland and Scotland—as are
separated by the Open Sea would fall entirely under
the territorial supremacy of the State concerned. On
the other hand, for a tunnel between two different
States separated by the Open Sea special arrangements
by treaty would have to be made concerning the territorial
supremacy over that part of the tunnel which
runs under the bed of the Open Sea.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>The proposed Channel Tunnel.</p></div>
<p>§ 287<i>d</i>. <a id="Since_there_is287d"></a>Since there is as yet no submarine tunnel in
existence, it is of interest to give some details concerning
the project of a Channel Tunnel<a id="FNanchor_594_594"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_594_594">[594]</a> between Dover
and Calais, and the preliminary arrangements between
France and England concerning it. Already some
years before the Franco-German War the possibility of
such a tunnel was discussed, but it was not until 1874
that the first preliminary steps were taken. The subsoil
of the Channel was geologically explored, plans were
worked out, and a shaft of more than a mile long was
tentatively bored from the English shore. And in 1876
an International Commission, appointed by the English
and French Governments, and comprising three French
and three English members, made a report on the construction
and working of the proposed tunnel.<a id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_595_595">[595]</a> The
report enclosed a memorandum, recommended by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
Commissioners to be adopted as the basis of a treaty
between Great Britain and France concerning the
tunnel, the juridically important articles of which are
the following:—</p>

<p>(Article 1) The boundary between England and
France in the tunnel shall be half-way between low-water
mark (above the tunnel) on the coast of England,
and low-water mark (above the tunnel) on the coast of
France. The said boundary shall be ascertained and
marked out under the direction of the International
Commission to be appointed, as mentioned in article 4,
before the Submarine Railway is opened for public
traffic. The definition of boundary provided for by
this article shall have reference to the tunnel and Submarine
Railway only, and shall not in any way affect
any question of the nationality of, or any rights of
navigation, fishing, anchoring, or other rights in, the
sea above the tunnel, or elsewhere than in the tunnel
itself.</p>
<p>(Article 4) There shall be constituted an International
Commission to consist of six members, three of
whom shall be nominated by the British Government
and three by the French Government....</p>
<hr class="small">
<p>The International Commission shall ... submit to
the two Governments its proposals for Supplementary
Conventions with respect—(<i>a</i>) to the apprehension and
trial of alleged criminals for offences committed in the
tunnel or in trains which have passed through it, and
the summoning of witnesses; (<i>b</i>) to customs, police,
and postal arrangements, and other matters which it
may be found convenient so to deal with.</p>
<p>(Article 15) Each Government shall have the right
to suspend the working of the Submarine Railway and
the passage through the tunnel whenever such Government<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
shall, in the interest of its own country, think
necessary to do so. And each Government shall have
power, to be exercised if and when such Government
may deem it necessary, to damage or destroy<a id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_596_596">[596]</a> the works
of the tunnel or Submarine Railway, or any part of
them, in the territory of such Government, and also
to flood the tunnel with water.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_596_596"></a><a href="#FNanchor_596_596" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[596]</span></a> This stipulation was proposed in the interest of defence in
time of war. As regards the position of a Channel Tunnel in time of war,
see Oppenheim in Z.V. II. (1908), pp. 13-16.</p></div>
<p>In spite of this elaborate preparation the project
could not be realised, since public opinion in England
was for political reasons opposed to it. And although
several times since—in 1880, 1884, 1888, and 1908—steps
were again taken in favour of the proposed tunnel,
public opinion in England remained hostile and the
project has had for the time to be abandoned. It is,
however, to be hoped and expected that ultimately the
tunnel will be built when the political conditions which
are now standing in the way of its realisation have
undergone a change.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Importance of Individuals to the Law of Nations.</p></div>
<p>§ 288. The importance of individuals to the Law
of Nations is just as great as that of territory, for
individuals are the personal basis of every State. Just
as a State cannot exist without a territory, so it cannot
exist without a multitude of individuals who are its
subjects and who, as a body, form the people or the
nation. The individuals belonging to a State can and
do come in various ways in contact with foreign States
in time of peace as well as of war. The Law of Nations
is therefore compelled to provide certain rules regarding
individuals.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Individuals never Subjects of the Law of Nations.</p></div>
<p>§ 289. <a id="No289"></a>Now, what is the position of individuals in
International Law according to these rules? Since
the Law of Nations is a law between States only and
exclusively, States only and exclusively<a id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_597_597">[597]</a> are subjects
of the Law of Nations. How is it, then, that, although
individuals are not subjects of the Law of Nations,
they <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>have certain rights and duties in conformity with
or according to International Law? Have not monarchs
and other heads of States, diplomatic envoys, and
even simple citizens certain rights according to the
Law of Nations whilst on foreign territory? If we look
more closely into these rights, it becomes quite obvious
that they are not given to the favoured individual by
the Law of Nations directly. For how could International
Law, which is a law between States, give rights
to individuals concerning their relations to a State?
What the Law of Nations really does concerning individuals,
is to impose the duty upon all the members
of the Family of Nations to grant certain privileges
to such foreign heads of States and diplomatic envoys,
and certain rights to such foreign citizens as are on
their territory. And, corresponding to this duty, every
State has by the Law of Nations a right to demand that
its head, its diplomatic envoys, and its simple citizens
be granted certain rights by foreign States when on
their territory. Foreign States granting these rights
to foreign individuals do this by their Municipal Laws,
and these rights are, therefore, not international rights,
but rights derived from Municipal Laws. International
Law is indeed the background of these rights in so far
as the duty to grant them is imposed upon the single
States by International Law. It is therefore quite
correct to say that the individuals have these rights in
conformity with or according to International Law, if
it is only remembered that these rights would not exist
had the single States not created them by their Municipal
Law.</p>

<p>And the same is valid as regards special rights of
individuals in foreign countries according to special
international treaties between two or more Powers.
Although such treaties mostly speak of rights which
individuals shall have as derived from the treaties themselves,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
this is nothing more than an inaccuracy of language.
In fact, such treaties do not create these rights,
but they impose the duty upon the contracting States of
calling these rights into existence by their Municipal
Laws.<a id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_598_598">[598]</a></p>

Jellinek, "System der subjectiven öffentlichen Rechte" (1892), pp.

<p>Again, in those rare cases in which States stipulate
by international treaties certain favours for individuals
other than their own subjects, these individuals do not
acquire any international rights under these treaties.
The latter impose the duty only upon the State whose
subjects these individuals are of calling those favours
into existence by its Municipal Law. Thus, for example,
when articles 5, 25, 35, and 44 of the Treaty of Berlin,
1878, made it a condition of the recognition of Bulgaria,
Montenegro, Servia, and Roumania, that these States
should not impose any religious disability upon their
subjects, the latter did not thereby acquire any international
rights. Another instructive example<a id="FNanchor_599_599"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_599_599">[599]</a> is furnished
by article 5 of the Peace Treaty of Prague, 1866,
between Prussia and Austria, which stipulated that
the northern district of Schleswig should be ceded by
Prussia to Denmark in case the inhabitants should by
a plebiscite vote in favour of such cession. Austria, no
doubt, intended to secure by this stipulation for the
inhabitants of North Schleswig the opportunity of
voting in favour of their union with Denmark. But
these inhabitants did not thereby acquire any international
right. Austria herself acquired only a right
to insist upon Prussia granting to the inhabitants the
opportunity of voting for the union with Denmark.
Prussia, however, intentionally neglected her duty,
Austria did not insist upon her right, and finally relinquished
it by the Treaty of Vienna of 1878.<a id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_600_600">[600]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_599_599"></a><a href="#FNanchor_599_599" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[599]</span></a> See

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_600_600"></a><a href="#FNanchor_600_600" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[600]</span></a> It ought to be mentioned that the opinion presented in the
text concerning the impossibility for individuals to be subjects of
International Law, which is now mostly upheld, is vigorously opposed by
Kaufmann, "Die Rechtskraft des internationalen Rechtes" (1899), §§ 1-4,
and a few others.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span></p></div>
<p>Now it is maintained<a id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_601_601">[601]</a> that, although individuals
cannot be subjects of International Law, they can
nevertheless acquire rights and duties from International
Law. But it is impossible to find a basis for the existence
of such rights and duties. International rights
and duties they cannot be, for international rights and
duties can only exist between States. Likewise they
cannot be municipal rights, for municipal rights and
duties can only be created by Municipal Law. The
opponents answer that such rights and duties nevertheless
exist, and quote for example articles 4 and 5 of
Convention XII. (concerning the establishment of an
International Prize Court) of the second Hague Peace
Conference, according to which individuals have a right
to bring an appeal before the International Prize Court.
But is this a real right? Is it not more correct to say
that the home States of the individuals concerned have
a right to demand that these individuals can bring the
appeal before the Court? Wherever International Law
creates an independent organisation, such as the International
Prize Court at the Hague or the European
Danube Commission and the like, certain powers and
claims must be given to the Courts and Commissions
and the individuals concerned, but these powers and
claims, and the obligations deriving therefrom, are neither
international nor municipal rights and duties: they
are powers, claims, and obligations existing only within
the organisations concerned. To call them rights and
duties—as indeed the respective treaties frequently do—is
a laxity of language which is quite tolerable as long
as one remembers that they neither comprise any relations
between States nor any claims and obligations
within the province of Municipal Law.</p>

in International Law, if they are not subjects thereof?
The answer can only be that they are <i>objects</i> of the
Law of Nations. They appear as such from many
different points of view. When, for instance, the Law
of Nations recognises the personal supremacy of every
State over its subjects at home and abroad, these
individuals appear just as much objects of the Law
of Nations as the territory of the States does in consequence
of the recognised territorial supremacy of the
States. When, secondly, the recognised territorial
supremacy of every State comprises certain powers
over foreign subjects within its boundaries without
their home State's having a right to interfere, these
individuals appear again as objects of the Law of
Nations. And, thirdly, when according to the Law
of Nations any State may seize and punish foreign
pirates on the Open Sea, or when belligerents may
seize and punish neutral blockade-runners and carriers
of contraband on the Open Sea without their home
State's having a right to interfere, individuals appear
here too as objects of the Law of Nations.<a id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_602_602">[602]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_602_602"></a><a href="#FNanchor_602_602" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[602]</span></a> Westlake, Chapters, p. 2, maintains that in these cases
individuals appear as <i>subjects</i> of International Law; but I cannot
understand upon what argument this assertion is based. The correct
standpoint is taken up by Lorimer, II. p. 131, and Holland,
"Jurisprudence," p. 341.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Nationality the Link between Individuals and the Law of
Nations.</p></div>
<p>§ 291. <a id="If_as_stated_individuals291"></a>If, as stated, individuals are never subjects
but always objects of the Law of Nations, then nationality
is the link between this law and individuals. It
is through the medium of their nationality only that
individuals can enjoy benefits from the existence of
the Law of Nations. This is a fact which has its consequences
over the whole area of International Law.<a id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_603_603">[603]</a>
Such individuals as do not possess any nationality enjoy
no protection whatever, and if they are aggrieved by
a State they have no way of redress, there being no
State which would be competent to take their case in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
hand. As far as the Law of Nations is concerned,
apart from morality, there is no restriction whatever to
cause a State to abstain from maltreating to any extent
such stateless individuals.<a id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_604_604">[604]</a> On the other hand, if
individuals who possess nationality are wronged abroad,
it is their home State only and exclusively which has
a right to ask for redress, and these individuals themselves
have no such right. It is for this reason that
the question of nationality is a very important one for
the Law of Nations, and that individuals enjoy benefits
from this law not as human beings but as subjects of
such States as are members of the Family of Nations.
And so distinct is the position as subjects of these
members from the position of stateless individuals and
from subjects of States outside the Family of Nations,
that it has been correctly characterised as a kind of
international "indigenousness," a <i>Völkerrechts-Indigenat</i>.<a id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_605_605">[605]</a>
Just as municipal citizenship procures for an
individual the enjoyment of the benefits of the Municipal
Laws, so this international "indigenousness,"
which is a necessary inference from municipal citizenship,
procures the enjoyment of the benefits of the
Law of Nations.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>The Law of Nations and the Rights of Mankind.</p></div>
<p>§ 292. <a id="Several_writ292"></a>Several writers<a id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_606_606">[606]</a> maintain that the Law of
Nations guarantees to every individual at home and
abroad the so-called rights of mankind, without regarding
whether an individual be stateless or not, or
whether he be a subject of a member-State of the
Family of Nations or not. Such rights are said to
comprise the right of existence, the right to protection
of honour, life, health, liberty, and property, the right
of practising any religion one likes, the right of emigration,
and the like. But such rights do not in fact<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
enjoy any guarantee whatever from the Law of Nations,<a id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_607_607">[607]</a>
and they cannot enjoy such guarantee, since the Law
of Nations is a law between States, and since individuals
cannot be subjects of this law. But there are certain
facts which cannot be denied at the background of this
erroneous opinion. The Law of Nations is a product
of Christian civilisation and represents a legal order
which binds States, chiefly Christian, into a community.
It is therefore no wonder that ethical ideas which are
some of them the basis of, others a development from,
Christian morals, have a tendency to require the help
of International Law for their realisation. When the
Powers stipulated at the Berlin Congress of 1878 that
the Balkan States should be recognised only under the
condition that they did not impose any religious disabilities
on their subjects, they lent their arm to the
realisation of such an idea. Again, when the Powers
after the beginning of the nineteenth century agreed
to several international arrangements in the interest
of the abolition of the slave trade,<a id="FNanchor_608_608"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_608_608">[608]</a> they fostered the
realisation of another of these ideas. And the innumerable
treaties between the different States as regards
extradition of criminals, commerce, navigation, copyright,
and the like, are inspired by the idea of affording
ample protection to life, health, and property of individuals.
Lastly, there is no doubt that, should a State
venture to treat its own subjects or a part thereof with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
such cruelty as would stagger humanity, public opinion
of the rest of the world would call upon the Powers to
exercise intervention<a id="FNanchor_609_609"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_609_609">[609]</a> for the purpose of compelling
such State to establish a legal order of things within its
boundaries sufficient to guarantee to its citizens an
existence more adequate to the ideas of modern civilisation.
However, a guarantee of the so-called rights of
mankind cannot be found in all these and other facts.
Nor do the actual conditions of life to which certain
classes of subjects are forcibly submitted within certain
States show that the Law of Nations really comprises
such guarantee.<a id="FNanchor_610_610"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_610_610">[610]</a></p>

abolished slavery, but there is no doubt that the conventional Law of

treaties have been concluded for that purpose during the nineteenth
century, since the Vienna Congress—namely, (1) the Treaty of London,
1841, between Great Britain, Austria, France, Prussia, and Russia; (2)
the General Act of the Congo Conference of Berlin, 1885, whose article 9
deals with the slave trade; (3) the General Act of the anti-slavery
Conference of Brussels, 1890, which is signed by Great Britain,
Austria-Hungary, Belgium, the Congo Free State, Denmark, France, (see,

<div class="sidenote"><p>Conception of Nationality.</p></div>
<p>§ 293. Nationality of an individual is his quality of
being a subject of a certain State and therefore its
citizen. It is not for International but for Municipal
Law to determine who is and who is not to be considered
a subject. And therefore it matters not, as
far as the Law of Nations is concerned, that Municipal
Laws may distinguish between different kinds of subjects—for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
instance, those who enjoy full political rights
and are on that account named citizens, and those who
are less favoured and are on that account not named
citizens. Nor does it matter that according to the
Municipal Laws a person may be a subject of a part
of a State, for instance of a colony, but not a subject
of the mother-country, provided only such person
appears as a subject of the mother-country as far as
the latter's international relations are concerned. Thus,
a person naturalised in a British Colony is for all international
purposes a British subject, although he may
not have the rights of a British subject within the United
Kingdom itself.<a id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_611_611">[611]</a> For all international purposes, all
distinctions made by Municipal Laws between subjects
and citizens and between different kinds of subjects
have neither theoretical nor practical value, and the
terms "subject" and "citizen" are, therefore, synonymously
made use of in the theory and practice of International
Law.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_611_611"></a><a href="#FNanchor_611_611" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[611]</span></a> See
 below, § <a href="#The_present_law307" class="pginternal">307</a>, and Hall, "Foreign Powers and
Jurisdiction," § 20, who quotes, however, a decision of the French Cour
de Cassation according to which naturalisation in a British Colony does
not constitute a real naturalisation. But this decision is based on the
Code Civil of France and has nothing to do with the Law of Nations. See
also Westlake, I. pp. 231-233.</p></div>
<p>But it must be emphasised that nationality as citizenship
of a certain State must not be confounded with
nationality as membership of a certain nation in the
sense of a race. Thus, all Englishmen, Scotchmen, and
Irishmen are, despite their different nationality as
regards their race, of British nationality as regards
their citizenship. Thus, further, although all Polish
individuals are of Polish nationality <i>qua</i> race, they
have been, since the partition of Poland at the end of
the eighteenth century between Russia, Austria, and
Prussia, either of Russian, Austrian, or German nationality
<i>qua</i> citizenship.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Function of Nationality.</p></div>
<p>§ 294. <a id="It_will_be_remembered294"></a>It will be remembered that nationality is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
the link between individuals and the benefits of the
Law of Nations.<a id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_612_612">[612]</a> This function of nationality becomes
apparent with regard to individuals abroad, or property
abroad of individuals who themselves are within the
territory of their home State. Through one particular
right and one particular duty of every State towards
all other States this function of nationality becomes
most conspicuous. The right is that of protection over
its citizens abroad which every State holds and occasionally
vigorously exercises towards other States; it
will be discussed in detail below, § <a href="#Although_aliens319" class="pginternal">319</a>. The duty, on
the other hand, is that of receiving on its territory such
citizens as are not allowed to remain<a id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_613_613">[613]</a> on the territory
of other States. Since no State is obliged by the Law
of Nations to allow foreigners to remain within its
boundaries, it may, for many reasons, happen that
certain individuals are expelled from all foreign countries.
The home State of those expelled cannot refuse
to receive them on the home territory, the expelling
States having a claim on the home State that the latter
do receive the expelled individuals.<a id="FNanchor_614_614"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_614_614">[614]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_612_612"></a><a href="#FNanchor_612_612" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[612]</span></a> See

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_614_614"></a><a href="#FNanchor_614_614" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[614]</span></a> Beyond the right of protection and the duty to receive
expelled citizens at home, the powers of a State over its citizens
abroad in consequence of its personal supremacy illustrate the function
of nationality. (See
 above, § <a href="#Independence_and_territorial124" class="pginternal">124</a>.) Thus, the home State can tax
citizens living abroad in the interest of home finance, can request them
to come home for the purpose of rendering military service, can punish
them for crimes committed abroad, can categorically request them to come
home for good (so-called <i>jus avocandi</i>). And no State has a right
forcibly to retain foreign citizens called home by their home State, or
to prevent them from paying taxes to their home State, and the like.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>So-called <i>Protégés</i> and <i>de facto</i> Subjects.</p></div>
<p>§ 295. Although nationality alone is the regular
means through which individuals can derive benefit
from the Law of Nations, there are two exceptional
cases in which individuals may come under the international
protection of a State without these individuals
being really its subjects. It happens, first, that a State
undertakes by an international agreement the diplomatic
protection of another State's citizens abroad, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
in this case the protected foreign subjects are named
"<i>protégés</i>" of the protecting States. Such agreements
are either concluded for a permanency as in the case of a
small State, Switzerland for instance, having no diplomatic
envoy in a certain foreign country where many
of its subjects reside, or in time of war only, a belligerent
handing over the protection of its subjects in
the enemy State to a neutral State.</p>
<p>It happens, secondly, that a State promises diplomatic
protection within the boundaries of Turkey and
other Oriental countries to certain natives. Such protected
natives are likewise named <i>protégés</i>, but they
are also called "<i>de facto</i> subjects" of the protecting
State. The position of these <i>protégés</i> is quite anomalous,
it is based on custom and treaties, and no
special rules of the Law of Nations itself are in existence
concerning such <i>de facto</i> subjects. Every State
which takes such <i>de facto</i> subjects under its protection
can act according to its discretion, and there is no
doubt that as soon as these Oriental States have reached
a level of civilisation equal to that of the Western
members of the Family of Nations, the whole institution
of the <i>de facto</i> subjects will disappear.</p>
<p>Concerning the exercise of protection in Morocco, a
treaty<a id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_615_615">[615]</a> was concluded at Madrid on July 3, 1880, signed
by Morocco, Great Britain, Austria-Hungary, Belgium,
France, Germany, Holland, Italy, Portugal, Spain,
Sweden-Norway, and the United States of America,
which sanctions the stipulations of the treaty of 1863
between France and Morocco concerning the same
subject. According to this treaty the term "<i>protégé</i>"
embraces<a id="FNanchor_616_616"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_616_616">[616]</a> in relation to States of Capitulations only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
the following classes of persons:—(1) Persons being
subjects of a country which is under the protectorate
of the Power whose protection they claim; (2) individuals
corresponding to the classes enumerated in the
treaties with Morocco of 1863 and 1880 and in the
Ottoman law of 1863; (3) persons, who under a special
treaty have been recognised as <i>protégés</i> like those
enumerated by article 4 of the French Muscat Convention
of 1844; and (4) those individuals who can
establish that they had been considered and treated
as <i>protégés</i> by the Power in question before the year
in which the creation of new <i>protégés</i> was regulated
and limited—that is to say, before the year 1863, these

It is of interest to note that the Court considers it a fact that the

of the pretended right to create '<i>protégés</i>' in unlimited number only
in relation to Turkey and Morocco, nevertheless the exercise of this
pretended right has been abandoned also in relation to other Oriental

very deficient written regulations of the capitulations as far as
circumstances are analogous."</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Nationality and Emigration.</p></div>
<p>§ 296. As emigration comprises the voluntary removal
of an individual from his home State with the
intention of residing abroad, but not necessarily with
the intention of renouncing his nationality, it is obvious
that emigrants may well retain their nationality. Emigration
is in fact entirely a matter of internal legislation
of the different States. Every State can fix for
itself the conditions under which emigrants lose or
retain their nationality, as it can also prohibit emigration
altogether, or can at any moment request those
who have emigrated to return to their former home,
provided the emigrants have retained their nationality
of birth. And it must be specially emphasised that
the Law of Nations does not and cannot grant
a right of emigration to every individual, although
it is frequently maintained that it is a "natural"<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
right of every individual to emigrate from his own

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_617_617"></a><a href="#FNanchor_617_617" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[617]</span></a> Attention ought to be drawn to the fact that, to ensure the
protection of the interests of emigrants and immigrants from the moral,
hygienic, and economic view, the Institute of International Law, at its
meeting at Copenhagen in 1897, adopted a body of fourteen principles
concerning emigration under the heading "Vœux relatifs à la matière

<div class="sidenote"><p>Five Modes of Acquisition of Nationality.</p></div>
<p>§ 297. Although it is for Municipal Law to determine
who is and who is not a subject of a State, it is
nevertheless of interest for the theory of the Law of
Nations to ascertain how nationality can be acquired
according to the Municipal Law of the different States.
The reason of the thing presents five possible modes of
acquiring nationality, and, although no State is obliged
to recognise all five, nevertheless all States practically
do recognise them. They are birth, naturalisation,
redintegration, subjugation, and cession.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Acquisition of Nationality by Birth.</p></div>
<p>§ 298. The first and chief mode of acquiring nationality
is by birth, for the acquisition of nationality by
another mode is exceptional only, since the vast majority
of mankind acquires nationality by birth and does not
change it afterwards. But no uniform rules exist according
to the Municipal Law of the different States
concerning this matter. Some States, as Germany and
Austria, have adopted the rule that descent alone is
the decisive factor,<a id="FNanchor_618_618"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_618_618">[618]</a> so that a child born of their subjects
becomes <i>ipso facto</i> by birth their subject likewise, be
the child born at home or abroad. According to this
rule, illegitimate children acquire the nationality of
their mother. Other States, such as Argentina, have
adopted the rule that the territory on which birth occurs
is exclusively the decisive factor.<a id="FNanchor_619_619"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_619_619">[619]</a> According to this
rule every child born on the territory of such State,
whether the parents be citizens or aliens, becomes
a subject of such State, whereas a child born abroad
is foreign, although the parents may be subjects.
Again, other States, as Great Britain<a id="FNanchor_620_620"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_620_620">[620]</a> and the United
States, have adopted a mixed principle, since, according
to their Municipal Law, not only children of their
subjects born at home or abroad become their subjects,
but also such children of alien parents as are born on
their territory.</p>

 details concerning British law on this point in Hall,
"Foreign Powers and Jurisdiction" (1894), § 14.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Acquisition of Nationality through Naturalisation.</p></div>
<p>§ 299. <a id="The_most_important299"></a>The most important mode of acquiring
nationality besides birth is that of naturalisation in
the wider sense of the term. Through naturalisation
an alien by birth acquires the nationality of the naturalising
State. According to the Municipal Law of the
different States naturalisation may take place through
six different acts—namely, marriage, legitimation, option,
acquisition of domicile, appointment as Government
official, grant on application. Thus, according to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
Municipal Law of most States, an alien female marrying
a subject of such State becomes thereby <i>ipso facto</i>
naturalised. Thus, further, according to the Municipal
Law of several States, an illegitimate child born of an
alien mother, and therefore an alien himself, becomes
<i>ipso facto</i> naturalised through the father marrying the
mother and thereby legitimating the child.<a id="FNanchor_621_621"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_621_621">[621]</a> Thus,
thirdly, according to the Municipal Law of some States,
which declare children of foreign parents born on their
territory to be aliens, such children, if, after having
come of age, they make a declaration that they intend
to be subjects of the country of their birth, become <i>ipso
facto</i> by such option naturalised. Again, fourthly, some
States, such as Venezuela, let an alien become naturalised
<i>ipso facto</i> by his taking his domicile<a id="FNanchor_622_622"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_622_622">[622]</a> on their
territory. Some States, fifthly, let an alien become
naturalised <i>ipso facto</i> on appointment as a Government
official. And, lastly, in all States naturalisation may
be procured through a direct act on the part of the
State granting nationality to an alien who has applied
for it. This last kind of naturalisation is naturalisation
in the narrower sense of the term; it is the most important
for the Law of Nations, and, whenever one
speaks of naturalisation pure and simple, such naturalisation
through direct grant on application is meant;
it will be discussed in detail below, §§ 303-307.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_621_621"></a><a href="#FNanchor_621_621" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[621]</span></a> English law has not adopted this rule.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_622_622"></a><a href="#FNanchor_622_622" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[622]</span></a> It is doubtful (see
 Hall, § 64) whether the home State of
such individuals naturalised against their will must submit to this
<i>ipso facto</i> naturalisation. See
 above, § <a href="#The_duty_of_every_State125" class="pginternal">125</a>, where the rule has been
stated that in consideration of the personal supremacy of the home State
over its citizens abroad no State can naturalise foreigners against
their will.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Acquisition of Nationality through Redintegration.</p></div>
<p>§ 300. The third mode of acquiring nationality is
that by so-called redintegration or resumption. Such
individuals as have been natural-born subjects of a
State, but have lost their original nationality through
naturalisation abroad or for some other cause, may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
recover their original nationality on their return home.
One speaks in this case of redintegration or resumption
in contradistinction to naturalisation, the favoured
person being redintegrated and resumed into his original
nationality. Thus, according to Section 10 of the
Naturalisation Act,<a id="FNanchor_623_623"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_623_623">[623]</a> 1870, a widow being a natural-born
British subject, who has lost her British nationality
through marriage with a foreigner, may at any time
during her widowhood obtain a certificate of readmission
to British nationality, provided she performs the
same conditions and adduces the same evidence as is
required in the case of an alien applying for naturalisation.
And according to section 8 of the same Act, a
British-born individual who has lost his British nationality
through being naturalised abroad, may, if he
returns home, obtain a certificate of readmission to
British nationality, provided he performs the same
conditions and adduces the same evidence as is required
in the case of an alien applying for naturalisation.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_623_623"></a><a href="#FNanchor_623_623" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[623]</span></a> 33 and 34 Vict. c. 14.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Acquisition of Nationality through Subjugation and Cession.</p></div>
<p>§ 301. <a id="The_fourth_and_fifth_modes301"></a>The fourth and fifth modes of acquiring
nationality are by subjugation after conquest and by
cession of territory, the inhabitants of the subjugated
as well as of the ceded territory acquiring <i>ipso facto</i>
by the subjugation or cession the nationality of the
State which acquires the territory. These modes of
acquisition of nationality are modes settled by the
customary Law of Nations; it will be remembered
that details concerning this matter have been given
above, §§ <a href="#As_the_object219" class="pginternal">219</a> and <a href="#Although_subjugation240" class="pginternal">240</a>.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Seven modes of losing Nationality.</p></div>
<p>§ 302. Although it is left in the discretion of the
different States to determine the grounds on which
individuals lose their nationality, it is nevertheless of
interest for the theory of the Law of Nations to take
notice of these grounds. Seven modes of losing nationality
must be stated to exist according to the reason<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
of the thing, although all seven are by no means recognised
by all the States. These modes are:—Release,
deprivation, expiration, option, substitution, subjugation,
and cession.</p>
<p>(1) Release. Some States, as Germany, give their
citizens the right to ask to be released from their nationality.
Such release, if granted, denationalises the released
individual.</p>
<p>(2) Deprivation. According to the Municipal Law
of some States, as, for instance, Bulgaria, Greece, Italy,
Holland, Portugal, and Spain, the fact that a citizen
enters into foreign civil or military service without permission
of his Sovereign deprives him of his nationality.</p>
<p>(3) <a id="Expiration_Some_States3of302"></a>Expiration. Some States have legislated that
citizenship expires in the cases of such of their subjects
as have emigrated and stayed abroad beyond a certain
length of time. Thus, a German ceases to be a German
subject through the mere fact that he has emigrated
and stayed abroad for ten years without having undertaken
the necessary step for the purpose of retaining
his nationality.</p>
<p>(4) Option. Some States, as Great Britain, which
declare a child born of foreign parents on their territory
to be their natural-born subject, although he becomes
at the same time according to the Municipal
Law of the home State of the parents a subject of
such State, give the right to such child to make, after
coming of age, a declaration that he desires to cease to
be a citizen. Such declaration of alienage creates <i>ipso
facto</i> the loss of nationality.</p>
<p>(5) Substitution. Many States, as, for instance, Great
Britain, have legislated that the nationality of their
subjects extinguishes <i>ipso facto</i> by their naturalisation
abroad, be it through marriage, grant on application,
or otherwise. Other States, however, as, for instance,
Germany, do not object to their citizens acquiring<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
another nationality besides that which they already
possess.</p>
<p>(6) Subjugation and cession. It is a universally recognised
customary rule of the Law of Nations that the
inhabitants of subjugated as well as ceded territory lose
their nationality and acquire that of the State which
annexes the territory.<a id="FNanchor_624_624"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_624_624">[624]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Conception and Importance of Naturalisation.</p></div>
<p>§ 303. Naturalisation in the narrower sense of the
term—in contradistinction to naturalisation <i>ipso facto</i>
through marriage, legitimation, option, domicile, and
Government office (see
 above, § <a href="#The_most_important299" class="pginternal">299</a>)—must be defined
as reception of an alien into the citizenship of a State
through a formal act on application of the favoured
individual. International Law does not provide any
such rules for such reception, but it recognises the
natural competence of every State as a Sovereign to
increase its population through naturalisation, although
a State might by its Municipal Law be prevented from
making use of this natural competence.<a id="FNanchor_625_625"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_625_625">[625]</a> In spite,
however, of the fact that naturalisation is a domestic
affair of the different States, it is nevertheless of special<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
importance to the theory and practice of the Law of
Nations. This is the case because naturalisation is
effected through a special grant of the naturalising
State, and regularly involves either a change or a
multiplication of nationality, facts which can be and
have been the source of grave international conflicts. In
the face of the fact that millions of citizens emigrate every
year from their home countries with the intention of
settling permanently in foreign countries, where the
majority of them become sooner or later naturalised,
the international importance of naturalisation cannot
be denied.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_625_625"></a><a href="#FNanchor_625_625" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[625]</span></a> But there is, as far as I know, no civilised State in
existence which abstains altogether from naturalising foreigners.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Object of Naturalisation.</p></div>
<p>§ 304. The object of naturalisation is always an
alien. Some States will naturalise such aliens only as
are stateless because they never have been citizens of
another State or because they have renounced, or have
been released from or deprived of, the citizenship of
their home State. But other States, as Great Britain,
naturalise also such aliens as are and remain subjects
of their home State. Most States naturalise such
person only as has taken his domicile in their country,
has been residing there for some length of time, and
intends permanently to remain in their country. And
according to the Municipal Law of many States, naturalisation
of a married individual includes that of his
wife and children under age. But although every alien
may be naturalised, no alien has, according to the Municipal
Law of most States, a claim to become naturalised,
naturalisation being a matter of discretion of the Government,
which can refuse it without giving any reasons.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Conditions of Naturalisation.</p></div>
<p>§ 305. If granted, naturalisation makes an alien a
citizen. But it is left to the discretion of the naturalising
State to grant naturalisation under any conditions
it likes. Thus, for example, Great Britain grants
naturalisation on the sole condition that the naturalised
alien shall not be deemed to be a British subject when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
within the limits of the foreign State of which he has
been a subject previously to his naturalisation, unless
at the time of naturalisation he has ceased to be a
subject of that State. And it must be specially mentioned
that naturalisation need not give an alien absolutely
the same rights as are possessed by natural-born
citizens. Thus according to article 2 of the Constitution
of the United States of America a naturalised
alien can never be elected President.<a id="FNanchor_626_626"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_626_626">[626]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_626_626"></a><a href="#FNanchor_626_626" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[626]</span></a> A foreigner naturalised in Great Britain by Letters of
Denization does not acquire the same rights as a natural-born British
subject. See Hall, "Foreign Powers and Jurisdiction" (1894), § 22.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Effect of Naturalisation upon previous Citizenship.</p></div>
<p>§ 306. Since the Law of Nations does not comprise
any rules concerning naturalisation, the effect of naturalisation
upon previous citizenship is exclusively a
matter of the Municipal Law of the States concerned.
Some States, as Great Britain,<a id="FNanchor_627_627"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_627_627">[627]</a> have legislated that one
of their subjects becoming naturalised abroad loses
thereby his previous nationality; but other States, as
Germany, have not done this. Further, some States,
as Great Britain again, deny every effect to the naturalisation
granted by them to an alien whilst he is
staying on the territory of the State whose subject he
was previously to his naturalisation, unless at the time
of naturalisation he was no longer a subject of such
State. But other States do not make this provision.
Be that as it may, there can be no doubt that a person
who is naturalised abroad and temporarily or permanently
returns into the country of his origin, can be
held responsible<a id="FNanchor_628_628"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_628_628">[628]</a> for all acts done there at the time
before his naturalisation abroad.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_627_627"></a><a href="#FNanchor_627_627" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[627]</span></a> Formerly Great Britain upheld the rule <i>nemo potest exuere
patriam</i>, but Section 6 of the Naturalisation Act, 1870, does away with
that rule. Its antithesis is the rule <i>ne quis invitus civitate mutetur,
neve in civitate maneat invitus</i> (Cicero, "Pro Balbo," c. 13, § 31; see
Rattigan, "Private International Law" (1895), p. 29, No. 21).</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_628_628"></a><a href="#FNanchor_628_628" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[628]</span></a> Many instructive cases concerning this matter are reported
by Wharton, II. §§ 180 and 181, and Moore, III. §§ 401-407. See also
Hall, § 71, where details concerning the practice of many States are
given with regard to their subjects naturalised abroad.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span></p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Naturalisation in Great Britain.</p></div>
<p>§ 307. <a id="The_present_law307"></a>The present law of Great Britain<a id="FNanchor_629_629"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_629_629">[629]</a> concerning
Naturalisation is mainly contained in the Naturalisation
Acts of 1870, 1874, and 1895.<a id="FNanchor_630_630"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_630_630">[630]</a> Aliens may on
their application become naturalised by a certificate
of naturalisation in case they have resided in the United
Kingdom or have been in the service of the British
Crown for a term of not less than five years, and in
case they have the intention to continue residing within
the United Kingdom or serving under the Crown. But
naturalisation may be refused without giving a reason
therefor (section 7). British possessions may legislate
on their own account concerning naturalisation (section
16), and aliens so naturalised are for all international
purposes<a id="FNanchor_631_631"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_631_631">[631]</a> British subjects. Where the Crown
enters into a convention with a foreign State to the
effect that the subjects of such State who have been
naturalised in Great Britain may divest themselves of
their status as British subjects, such naturalised British
subjects can through a declaration of alienage shake
off the acquired British nationality (section 3). Naturalisation
of the husband includes that of his wife,
and naturalisation of the father, or mother in case she
is a widow, includes naturalisation of such children as
have during infancy become resident in the United
Kingdom at the time of their father's or mother's
naturalisation (section 10). Neither the case of children
who are not resident within the United Kingdom
or not resident with their father in the service of the
Crown abroad at the time of the naturalisation of their
father or widowed mother, nor the case of children

<p>Not to be confounded with naturalisation proper is
naturalisation through <i>denization</i> by means of Letters
Patent under the Great Seal. This way of making an
alien a British subject is based on a very ancient practice<a id="FNanchor_634_634"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_634_634">[634]</a>
which has not yet become obsolete. Such denization
requires no previous residence within the United
Kingdom. "A person may be made a denizen without
ever having set foot upon British soil. There have been,
and from time to time there no doubt will be, persons
of foreign nationality to whom it is wished to entrust
functions which can only be legally exercised by British
subjects. In such instances, the condition of five years'
residence in the United Kingdom would generally be
prohibitory. The difficulty can be avoided by the issue
of Letters of Denization; and it is believed that on
one or two occasions letters have in fact been issued
with the view of enabling persons of foreign nationality
to exercise British consular jurisdiction in the East."

<div class="sidenote"><p>Possibility of Double and Absent Nationality.</p></div>
<p>§ 308. The Law of Nations having no rule concerning
acquisition and loss of nationality beyond this, that
nationality is lost and acquired through subjugation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
and cession, and, on the other hand, the Municipal
Laws of the different States differing in many points
concerning this matter, the necessary consequence is
that an individual may own two different nationalities
as easily as none at all. The points to be discussed
here are therefore: how double nationality occurs, the
position of individuals with double nationality, how
absent nationality occurs, the position of individuals
destitute of nationality, and, lastly, means of redress
against difficulties arising from double and absent
nationality.</p>
<p>It must, however, be specially mentioned that the
Law of Nations is concerned with such cases only of
double and absent nationality as are the consequences
of conflicting Municipal Laws of several absolutely
different States. Such cases as are the consequence
of the Municipal Laws of a Federal State or of a State
which, as Great Britain, allows outlying parts to legislate
on their own account concerning naturalisation,
fall outside the scope of the Law of Nations. Thus the
fact that, according to the law of Germany, a German
can be at the same time a subject of several member-States
of the German Empire, or can be a subject of
this Empire without being a subject of one of its member-States,
does as little concern the Law of Nations
as the fact that an individual can be a subject of a
British Colonial State without at the same time being
a subject of the United Kingdom. For internationally
such individuals appear as subjects of such Federal
State or the mother-country, whatever their position
may be inside these States.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>How Double Nationality occurs.</p></div>
<p>§ 309. An individual may own double nationality
knowingly or unknowingly, and with or without intention.
And double nationality may be produced by
every mode of acquiring nationality. Even birth can
vest a child with double nationality. Thus, every child<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
born in Great Britain of German parents acquires at
the same time British and German nationality, for such
child is British according to British, and German
according to German Municipal Law. Double nationality
can likewise be the result of marriage. Thus, a
Venezuelan woman marrying an Englishman acquires
according to British law British nationality, but according
to Venezuelan law she does not lose her Venezuelan
nationality. Legitimation of illegitimate children can
produce the same effect. Thus, an illegitimate child of
a German born in England of an English mother is a
British subject according to British and German law,
but if after the birth of the child the father marries the
mother and remains a resident in England, he thereby
legitimates the child according to German law, and
such child acquires thereby German nationality without
losing his British nationality, although the mother
does lose her British nationality.<a id="FNanchor_635_635"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_635_635">[635]</a> Again, double
nationality may be the result of option. Thus, a child
born in France of German parents acquires German
nationality, but if, after having come of age, he acquires
French nationality by option through making the
declaration necessary according to French Municipal
Law, he does not thereby, according to German Municipal
Law, lose his German nationality. It is not necessary
to give examples of double nationality caused by
taking domicile abroad, accepting foreign Government
office, and redintegration, and it suffices merely to draw
attention to the fact that naturalisation in the narrower
sense of the term is frequently a cause of double
nationality, since individuals may apply for and receive
naturalisation in a State without thereby losing
the nationality of their home State.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_635_635"></a><a href="#FNanchor_635_635" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[635]</span></a> This is the consequence of Section 10, Nos. 1 and 3, of the
Naturalisation Act, 1870.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Position of Individuals with Double Nationality.</p></div>
<p>§ 310. Individuals owning double nationality bear<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
in the language of diplomatists the name <i>sujets mixtes</i>.
The position of such "mixed subjects" is awkward
on account of the fact that two different States claim
them as subjects, and therefore their allegiance. In
case a serious dispute arises between these two States
which leads to war, an irreconcilable conflict of duties
is created for these unfortunate individuals. It is all
very well to say that such conflict is a personal matter
which concerns neither the Law of Nations nor the
two States in dispute. As far as an individual has,
through naturalisation, option, and the like, acquired
his double nationality, one may say that he has placed
himself in that awkward position by intentionally and
knowingly acquiring a second without being released
from his original nationality. But those who are
natural-born <i>sujets mixtes</i> in most cases do not know
thereof before they have to face the conflict, and their
difficult position is not their own fault.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, there is no doubt that each
of the States claiming such an individual as subject
is internationally competent to do this, although they
cannot claim him against one another, since each of
them correctly maintains that he is its subject.<a id="FNanchor_636_636"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_636_636">[636]</a> But
against third States each of them appears as his Sovereign,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
and it is therefore possible that each of them
can exercise its right of protection over him within
third States.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_636_636"></a><a href="#FNanchor_636_636" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[636]</span></a> I cannot agree with the statement in its generality made by
Westlake, I. p. 221:—"If, for instance, a man claimed as a national
both by the United Kingdom and by another country should contract in the
latter a marriage permitted by its laws to its subjects, an English
Court would have to accept him as a married man." If this were correct,
the marriage of a German who, without having given up his German
citizenship, has become naturalised in Great Britain and has afterwards
married his niece in Germany, would have to be recognised as legal by
the English Courts. The correct solution seems to me to be that such
marriage is legal in Germany, but not legal in England, because British
law does not admit of marriage between uncle and niece. The case is
different when a German who marries his niece in Germany, afterwards
takes his domicile and becomes naturalised in England; in this case
English Courts would have to recognise the marriage as legal because
German law does not object to a marriage between uncle and niece, and
because the marriage was concluded before the man took his domicile in
England and became a British subject. See Foote, "Private International
Jurisprudence," 3rd ed. (1904), p. 106, and the cases there cited.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>How Absent Nationality occurs.</p></div>
<p>§ 311. An individual may be destitute of nationality
knowingly or unknowingly, intentionally or
through no fault of his own. Even by birth a person
may be stateless. Thus, an illegitimate child born in
Germany of an English mother is actually destitute of
nationality because according to German law he does
not acquire German nationality, and according to
British law he does not acquire British nationality.
Thus, further, all children born in Germany of parents
who are destitute of nationality are themselves, according
to German law, stateless. But statelessness may
take place after birth. All individuals who have
lost their original nationality without having acquired
another are in fact destitute of nationality.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Position of Individuals destitute of Nationality.</p></div>
<p>§ 312. <a id="That_stateless_individuals312"></a>That stateless individuals are objects of the
Law of Nations in so far as they fall under the territorial
supremacy of the State on whose territory they live
there is no doubt whatever. But since they do not
own a nationality, the link<a id="FNanchor_637_637"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_637_637">[637]</a> by which they could derive
benefits from International Law is missing, and thus
they lack any protection whatever as far as this law
is concerned. The position of such individuals destitute
of nationality may be compared to vessels on the
Open Sea not sailing under the flag of a State, which
likewise do not enjoy any protection whatever. In
practice, stateless individuals are in most States treated
more or less as though they were subjects of foreign
States, but as a point of international legality there is
no restriction whatever upon a State's maltreating them
to any extent.<a id="FNanchor_638_638"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_638_638">[638]</a></p>

example. According to Municipal Law they are, with a few exceptions,
considered as foreigners for the purpose of avoiding the consequences of
article 44 of the Treaty of Berlin, 1878, according to which no
religious disabilities may be imposed by Roumania upon her subjects. But
as these Jews are not subjects of any other State, Roumania compels them
to render military service, and actually treats them in every way
according to discretion without any foreign State being able to exercise
a right of protection over them. See Rey in R.G. X. (1903), pp. 460-526,
and Bar in R.I. 2nd Ser. IX. (1907), pp. 711-716. See also

<div class="sidenote"><p>Redress against Difficulties arising from Double and Absent
Nationality.</p></div>
<p>§ 313. Double as well as absent nationality of individuals
has from time to time created many difficulties
for the States concerned. As regards the remedy for
such difficulties, it is comparatively easy to meet those
created by absent nationality. If the number of stateless
individuals increases much within a certain State,
the latter can require them to apply for naturalisation
or to leave the country; it can even naturalise them
by Municipal Law against their will, as no other State
will, or has a right to, interfere, and as, further, the
very fact of the existence of individuals destitute of
nationality is a blemish in Municipal as well as in
International Law. Much more difficult is it, however,
to find, within the limits of the present rules of
the Law of Nations, means of redress against conflicts
arising from double nationality. Very grave disputes
indeed have occasionally occurred between States on
account of individuals who were claimed as subjects
by both sides. Thus, in 1812, a time when England
still kept to her old rule that no natural-born English
subject could lose his nationality, the United States
went to war with England because the latter impressed
Englishmen naturalised in America from on board
American merchantmen, claiming the right to do so,
as according to her law these men were still English
citizens. Thus, further, Prussia frequently had during
the sixties of the last century disputes with the United
States on account of Prussian individuals who, without
having rendered military service at home, had
emigrated to America to become there naturalised
and had afterwards returned to Prussia.<a id="FNanchor_639_639"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_639_639">[639]</a> Again, during<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
the time of the revolutionary movements in Ireland
in the last century before the Naturalisation Act of
1870 was passed, disputes arose between Great Britain
and the United States on account of such Irishmen
as took part in these revolutionary movements after
having become naturalised in the United States.<a id="FNanchor_640_640"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_640_640">[640]</a> It
would seem that the only way in which all the difficulties
arising from double and absent nationality could
really be done away with is for all the Powers to agree
upon an international convention, according to which
they undertake the obligation to enact by their Municipal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
Law such corresponding rules regarding acquisition
and loss of nationality as make the very occurrence
of double and absent nationality impossible.<a id="FNanchor_641_641"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_641_641">[641]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_639_639"></a><a href="#FNanchor_639_639" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[639]</span></a> The case of Martin Koszta ought here to be mentioned,
details of which are reported by Wharton, II. § 175; Moore, III. §§
490-491, and Martens, "Causes Célèbre," V. pp. 583-599. Koszta was a
Hungarian subject who took part in the revolutionary movement of 1848,
escaped to the United States, and in July, 1852, made a declaration
under oath, before a proper tribunal, of his intention to become
naturalised there. After remaining nearly two years in the United
States, but before he was really naturalised, he visited Turkey, and
obtained a <i>tezkereh</i>, a kind of letter of safe-conduct, from the
American Chargé d'Affaires at Constantinople. Later on, while at Smyrna,
he was seized by Austrian officials and taken on board an Austrian
man-of-war with the intention of bringing him to Austria, to be there
punished for his part in the revolution of 1848. The American Consul
demanded his release, but Austria maintained that she had a right to
arrest Koszta according to treaties between her and Turkey. Thereupon
the American man-of-war <i>Saint Louis</i> threatened to attack the Austrian
man-of-war in case she would not give up her prisoner, and an
arrangement was made that Koszta should be delivered into the custody of
the French Consul at Smyrna until the matter was settled between the
United States and Austrian Governments. Finally, Austria consented to
Koszta's being brought back to America. Although Koszta was not yet
naturalised, the United States claimed a right of protection over him,
since he had taken his domicile on her territory with the intention to
become there naturalised in due time, and had thereby in a sense
acquired the national character of an American.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_640_640"></a><a href="#FNanchor_640_640" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[640]</span></a> The United States have, through the so-called "Bancroft
Treaties," attempted to overcome conflicts arising from double
nationality. The first of these treaties was concluded in 1868 with the
North German Confederation, the precursor of the present German Empire,
and signed on behalf of the United States by her Minister in Berlin,
George Bancroft. (See Wharton, II. §§ 149 and 179, and Moore, III. §§
391-400.) In the same and the following years treaties of the same kind
were concluded with many other States, the last with Portugal in 1908. A
treaty of another kind, but with the same object, was concluded between
the United States and Great Britain on May 13, 1870. (See Martens,
N.R.G. XX. p. 524, and Moore, III. § 397.) All these treaties stipulate
that naturalisation in one of the contracting States shall be recognised
by the other, whether the naturalised individual has or has not
previously been released from his original citizenship, provided he has
resided for five years in such country. And they further stipulate that
such naturalised individuals, in case they return after naturalisation
into their former home State and take their residence there for some
years, either <i>ipso facto</i> become again subjects of their former home
State and cease to be naturalised abroad (as the Bancroft Treaties), or
can be reinstated in their former citizenship, and cease thereby to be
naturalised abroad (as the treaty with Great Britain).</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>No Obligation to admit Aliens.</p></div>
<p>§ 314. Many writers<a id="FNanchor_642_642"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_642_642">[642]</a> maintain that every member
of the Family of Nations is bound by International
Law to admit all aliens into its territory for all lawful
purposes, although they agree that every State could
exclude certain classes of aliens. This opinion is generally
held by those who assert that there is a fundamental
right of intercourse between States. It will be
remembered<a id="FNanchor_643_643"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_643_643">[643]</a> that no such fundamental right exists,
but that intercourse is a characteristic of the position
of the States within the Family of Nations and therefore
a presupposition of the international personality of
every State. A State, therefore, cannot exclude aliens
altogether from its territory without violating the
spirit of the Law of Nations and endangering its very
membership of the Family of Nations. But no State
actually does exclude aliens altogether. The question
is only whether an international legal duty can be said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
to exist for every State to admit all unobjectionable
aliens to all parts of its territory. And it is this duty
which must be denied as far as the customary Law of
Nations is concerned. It must be emphasised that,
apart from general conventional arrangements, as, for
instance, those concerning navigation on international
rivers, and apart from special treaties of commerce,
friendship, and the like, no State can claim the right
for its subjects to enter into and reside on the territory
of a foreign State. The reception of aliens is a matter
of discretion, and every State is by reason of its territorial
supremacy competent to exclude aliens from the
whole or any part of its territory. And it is only by
an inference of this competence that Great Britain,<a id="FNanchor_644_644"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_644_644">[644]</a> the
United States of America, and other States have made
special laws according to which paupers and criminals,
as well as diseased and other objectionable aliens, are
prevented from entering their territory. Every State
is and must remain master in its own house, and such
mastership is of especial importance with regard to the
admittance of aliens. Of course, if a State excluded all
subjects of one State only, this would constitute an
unfriendly act, against which retorsion would be admissible;
but it cannot be denied that a State is competent
to do this, although in practice such wholesale
exclusion will never happen. Hundreds of treaties of
commerce and friendship exist between the members
of the Family of Nations according to which they are
obliged to receive each other's unobjectionable subjects,
and thus practically the matter is settled, although
in strict law every State is competent to exclude
foreigners from its territory.<a id="FNanchor_645_645"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_645_645">[645]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Reception of Aliens under conditions.</p></div>
<p>§ 315. It is obvious that, if a State need not receive
aliens at all, it can, on the other hand, receive them
under certain conditions only. Thus, for example,
Russia does not admit aliens without passports, and if
the alien adheres to the Jewish faith he has to submit
to a number of special restrictions. Thus, further,
during the time Napoleon III. ruled in France, every
alien entering French territory from the sea or from
neighbouring land was admitted only after having
stated his name, nationality, and the place to which he
intended to go. Some States, as Switzerland, make a
distinction between such aliens as intend to settle down
in the country and such as intend only to travel in the
country; no alien is allowed to settle in the country
without having asked and received a special authorisation
on the part of the Government, whereas the country
is unconditionally open to all mere travelling aliens.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>So-called Right of Asylum.</p></div>
<p>§ 316. The fact that every State exercises territorial
supremacy over all persons on its territory, whether
they are its subjects or aliens, excludes the prosecution
of aliens thereon by foreign States. Thus, a foreign
State is, provisionally at least, an asylum for every
individual who, being prosecuted at home, crosses its
frontier. In the absence of extradition treaties stipulating
the contrary, no State is by International Law
obliged to refuse admittance into its territory to such
a fugitive or, in case he has been admitted, to expel
him or deliver him up to the prosecuting State. On
the contrary, States have always upheld their competence
to grant asylum if they choose to do so. Now
the so-called right of asylum is certainly not a right of
the alien to demand that the State into whose territory
he has entered with the intention of escaping prosecution
from some other State should grant protection and
asylum. For such State need not grant them. The
so-called right of asylum is nothing but the competence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
mentioned above of every State, and inferred from its
territorial supremacy, to allow a prosecuted alien to
enter and to remain on its territory under its protection,
and to grant thereby an asylum to him. Such
fugitive alien enjoys the hospitality of the State which
grants him asylum; but it might be necessary to place
him under surveillance, or even to intern him at some
place in the interest of the State which is prosecuting
him. For it is the duty of every State to prevent
individuals living on its territory from endangering the
safety of another State. And if a State grants asylum
to a prosecuted alien, this duty becomes of special
importance.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Aliens subjected to territorial Supremacy.</p></div>
<p>§ 317. <a id="Wi317"></a>With his entrance into a State, an alien,
unless he belongs to the class of those who enjoy so-called
exterritoriality, falls at once under such State's
territorial supremacy, although he remains at the same
time under the personal supremacy of his home State.
Such alien is therefore under the jurisdiction of the
State in which he stays, and is responsible to such
State for all acts he commits on its territory. He is
further subjected to all administrative arrangements of
such State which concern the very locality where the
alien is. If in consequence of a public calamity, such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
as the outbreak of a fire or an infectious disease, certain
administrative restrictions are enforced, they can
be enforced against all aliens as well as against citizens.
But apart from jurisdiction and mere local administrative
arrangements, both of which concern all aliens
alike, a distinction must be made between such aliens
as are merely travelling and stay, therefore, only temporarily
on the territory, and such as take their residence
there either permanently or for some length of time.
A State has wider power over aliens of the latter kind;
it can make them pay rates and taxes, and can even
compel them in case of need, under the same conditions
as citizens, to serve in the local police and the local
fire brigade for the purpose of maintaining public order
and safety. On the other hand, an alien does not fall
under the personal supremacy of the local State; therefore
he cannot be made to serve<a id="FNanchor_646_646"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_646_646">[646]</a> in its army or navy,
and cannot, like a citizen, be treated according to
discretion.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_646_646"></a><a href="#FNanchor_646_646" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[646]</span></a> See,
 however,
 above, § <a href="#Just_like_independence127" class="pginternal">127</a>, concerning the attitude of
Great Britain with regard to aliens in British colonies.</p></div>
<p>It must be emphasised that an alien is responsible
to the local State for all illegal acts which he commits
while the territory concerned is during war temporarily
occupied by the enemy. An illustrative case is that of
De Jager <i>v.</i> the Attorney-General for Natal.<a id="FNanchor_647_647"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_647_647">[647]</a> De Jager
was a burgher of the South African Republic, but a settled
resident at Natal when the South African War broke
out. In October 1899 the British forces evacuated
that part of Natal in which Waschbank, where he lived,
is situated, and the Boer forces were in occupation for
some six months. He joined them, and served in
different capacities until March 1900, when he went to
the Transvaal, and took no further part in the war.</p>

of De Jager.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span></p></div>
<p>He was tried in March 1901, and convicted of high

a fine of £5000, or, failing payment thereof, to a further
three years.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Aliens in Eastern Countries.</p></div>
<p>§ 318. <a id="The_rule_that_aliens318"></a>The rule that aliens fall under the territorial
supremacy of the State they are in finds an exception
in Turkey and, further, in such other Eastern States,
like China, as are, in consequence of their deficient
civilisation, only for some parts members of the Family
of Nations. Aliens who are subjects of Christian States
and enter into the territory of such Eastern States,
remain wholly under the jurisdiction<a id="FNanchor_648_648"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_648_648">[648]</a> of their home
State. This exceptional condition of things is based,
as regards Turkey, on custom and treaties which are
called Capitulations, as regards other Eastern States
on treaties only.<a id="FNanchor_649_649"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_649_649">[649]</a> Jurisdiction over aliens in these
countries is exercised by the consuls of their home
States, which have enacted special Municipal Laws for
that purpose. Thus, Great Britain has enacted so-called
Foreign Jurisdiction Acts at several times, which
are now all consolidated in the Foreign Jurisdiction
Act of 1890.<a id="FNanchor_650_650"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_650_650">[650]</a> It must be specially mentioned that
Japan has since 1899 ceased to belong to the Eastern

<div class="sidenote"><p>Aliens under the Protection of their Home State.</p></div>
<p>§ 319. <a id="Although_aliens319"></a>Although aliens fall at once under the territorial
supremacy of the State they enter, they remain
nevertheless under the protection of their home State.
By a universally recognised customary rule of the Law
of Nations every State holds a right of protection<a id="FNanchor_651_651"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_651_651">[651]</a>
over its citizens abroad, to which corresponds the duty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
of every State to treat foreigners on its territory with a
certain consideration which will be discussed below,
§§ <a href="#Under_the_influence320" class="pginternal">320</a>-322. The question here is only when and how
this right of protection can be exercised.<a id="FNanchor_652_652"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_652_652">[652]</a> Now there
is certainly, as far as the Law of Nations is concerned,
no duty incumbent upon a State to exercise its protection
over its citizens abroad. The matter is absolutely
in the discretion of every State, and no citizen
abroad has by International Law, although he may have
it by Municipal Law, a right to demand protection from
his home State. Often for political reasons States have
in certain cases refused the exercise of their right of
protection over citizens abroad. Be that as it may,
every State <i>can</i> exercise this right when one of its
subjects is wronged abroad in his person or property,
either by the State itself on whose territory such person
or property is for the time, or by such State's officials
or citizens without such State's interfering for the
purpose of making good the wrong done.<a id="FNanchor_653_653"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_653_653">[653]</a> And this
right can be realised in several ways. Thus, a State
whose subjects are wronged abroad can diplomatically
insist upon the wrongdoers being punished according
to the law of the land and upon damages, if necessary,
being paid to its subjects concerned. It can, secondly,
exercise retorsion and reprisals for the purpose of making
the other State comply with its demands. It can,
further, exercise intervention, and it can even go to
war when necessary. And there are other means besides
those mentioned. It is, however, quite impossible
to lay down hard-and-fast rules as regards the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
question in which way and how far in every case the
right of protection ought to be exercised. Everything
depends upon the merits of the individual case and
must be left to the discretion of the State concerned.
The latter will have to take into consideration whether
the wronged alien was only travelling through or had
settled down in the country, whether his behaviour had
been provocative or not, how far the foreign Government
identified itself with the acts of officials or subjects,
and the like.</p>

intercourse between the members of the Family of Nations (see

<p>§ 320. <a id="Under_the_influence320"></a>Under the influence of the right of protection
over its subjects abroad which every State holds, and
the corresponding duty of every State to treat aliens
on its territory with a certain consideration, an alien,
provided he owns a nationality at all, cannot be outlawed
in foreign countries, but must be afforded protection
of his person and property. The home State of
the alien has by its right of protection a claim upon such
State as allows him to enter its territory that such protection
shall be afforded, and it is no excuse that such
State does not provide any protection whatever for its
own subjects. In consequence thereof every State is
by the Law of Nations compelled, at least, to grant to
aliens equality before the law with its citizens as far as
safety of person and property is concerned. An alien
must in especial not be wronged in person or property
by the officials and Courts of a State. Thus, the police
must not arrest him without just cause, custom-house
officials must treat him civilly, Courts of Justice must
treat him justly and in accordance with the law.
Corrupt administration of the law against natives is no
excuse for the same against aliens, and no Government
can cloak itself with the judgment of corrupt judges.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>How far Aliens can be treated according to Discretion.</p></div>
<p>§ 321. Apart from protection of person and property,
every State can treat aliens according to discretion,
those points excepted concerning which discretion is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
restricted through international treaties between the
States concerned. Thus, a State can exclude aliens
from certain professions and trades; it can, as Great
Britain did formerly and Russia does even to-day,
exclude them from holding real property; it can, as
again Great Britain<a id="FNanchor_654_654"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_654_654">[654]</a> did in former times, compel them
to have their names registered for the purpose of keeping
them under control, and the like. It must, however,
be stated that there is a tendency within all the States
which are members of the Family of Nations to treat
admitted aliens more and more on the same footing as
citizens, political rights and duties, of course, excepted.
Thus, for instance, with the only exception that an
alien cannot be sole or part owner of a British ship,
aliens having taken up their domicile in this country
are for all practical purposes treated by the law<a id="FNanchor_655_655"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_655_655">[655]</a> of
the land on the same footing as British subjects.</p>

William IV. c. 11).</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_655_655"></a><a href="#FNanchor_655_655" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[655]</span></a> That aliens cannot now any longer belong to the London
Stock Exchange, is an outcome not of British Municipal Law, but of
regulations of the Stock Exchange.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Departure from the Foreign Country.</p></div>
<p>§ 322. Since a State holds territorial only, but not
personal supremacy over an alien within its boundaries,
it can never under any circumstances prevent him from
leaving its territory, provided he has fulfilled his local
obligations, as payment of rates and taxes, of fines, of
private debts, and the like. And an alien leaving a
State can take all his property away with him, and a
tax for leaving the country or tax upon the property
he takes away with him<a id="FNanchor_656_656"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_656_656">[656]</a> cannot be levied. And it
must be specially mentioned that since the beginning
of the nineteenth century the so-called <i>droit d'aubaine</i>
belongs to the past; this is the name of the right, which
was formerly frequently exercised, of a State to confiscate
the whole estate of an alien deceased on its territory.<a id="FNanchor_657_657"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_657_657">[657]</a>
But if a State levies estate duties in the case of a citizen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
dying on its territory, as Great Britain does according
to the Finance Act<a id="FNanchor_658_658"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_658_658">[658]</a> of 1894, such duties can likewise
be levied in case of an alien dying on its territory.</p>

in the case also of such alien dying abroad as leaves movable property
in the United Kingdom without having ever been resident there. As far as
the Law of Nations is concerned, it is doubtful whether Great Britain is
competent to claim estate duties in such cases.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Competence to expel Aliens.</p></div>
<p>§ 323. Just as a State is competent to refuse admittance
to an alien, so it is, in conformity with its territorial
supremacy, competent to expel at any moment
an alien who has been admitted into its territory. And
it matters not whether the respective individual is
only on a temporary visit or has settled down for professional
or business purposes on that territory, having
taken his domicile thereon. Such States, of course, as
have a high appreciation of individual liberty and
abhor arbitrary powers of Government will not readily
expel aliens. Thus, the British Government has no
power to expel even the most dangerous alien without
the recommendation of a Court, or without an Act of
Parliament making provision for such expulsion. And
in Switzerland, article 70 of the Constitution empowers
the Government to expel such aliens only as endanger<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
the internal and external safety of the land. But
many States are in no way prevented by their Municipal
Law from expelling aliens according to discretion, and
examples of arbitrary expulsion of aliens, who had made
themselves objectionable to the respective Governments,
are numerous in the past and the present.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it cannot be denied that, especially
in the case of expulsion of an alien who has been
residing within the expelling State for some length of
time and has established a business there, the home
State of the expelled individual is by its right of protection
over citizens abroad justified in making diplomatic
representations to the expelling State and asking
for the reasons for the expulsion. But as in strict law
a State can expel even domiciled aliens without so much
as giving the reasons, the refusal of the expelling State
to supply the reasons for expulsion to the home State
of the expelled alien does not constitute an illegal,
although a very unfriendly, act. And there is no doubt
that every expulsion of an alien without just cause is,
in spite of its international legality, an unfriendly act,
which can rightfully be met with retorsion.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Just Causes of Expulsion of Aliens.</p></div>
<p>§ 324. <a id="On324"></a>On account of the fact that retorsion might
be justified, the question is of importance what just
causes of expulsion of aliens there are. As International
Law gives no detailed rules regarding expulsion, everything
is left to the discretion of the single States and
depends upon the merits of the individual case. Theory
and practice correctly make a distinction between expulsion
in time of war and in time of peace. A belligerent
may consider it convenient to expel all enemy
subjects residing or temporarily staying within his
territory. And, although such a measure may be very
hard and cruel, the opinion is general that such expulsion
is justifiable.<a id="FNanchor_659_659"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_659_659">[659]</a> As regards expulsion in time of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
peace, on the other hand, the opinions of writers as
well as of States naturally differ much. Such State
as expels an alien will hardly admit not having had
a just cause. Some States, as Belgium<a id="FNanchor_660_660"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_660_660">[660]</a> since 1885,
possess Municipal Laws determining just causes for the
expulsion of aliens, and such States' discretion concerning
expulsion is, of course, more or less restricted.
But many States do not possess such laws, and are,
therefore, entirely at liberty to consider a cause as
justifying expulsion or not. The Institute of International
Law at its meeting at Geneva in 1892 adopted
a body of forty-one articles concerning the admittance
and expulsion of aliens, and in article 28 thereof enumerated
nine just causes for expulsion in time of peace.<a id="FNanchor_661_661"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_661_661">[661]</a>
I doubt whether the States will ever come to an agreement
about just causes of expulsion. The fact cannot
be denied that an alien is more or less a guest in the
foreign land, and the question under what conditions
such guest makes himself objectionable to his host
cannot once for all be answered by the establishment
of a body of rules. So much is certain, that with the
gradual disappearance of despotic views in the different
States, and with the advance of true constitutionalism
guaranteeing individual liberty and freedom of opinion
and speech, expulsion of aliens, especially for political
reasons, will become less frequent. Expulsion will,
however, never totally disappear, because it may well be
justified. Thus, for example, Prussia after the annexation
of the formerly Free Town of Frankfort-on-the-Main,
was certainly justified in expelling those individuals
who, for the purpose of avoiding military service in the
Prussian Army, had by naturalisation become Swiss
citizens without giving up their residence at Frankfort.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_659_659"></a><a href="#FNanchor_659_659" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[659]</span></a> Thus in 1870, during the Franco-German war, the French
expelled all Germans from France, and the former South African Republic

<div class="sidenote"><p>Expulsion how effected.</p></div>
<p>§ 325. Expulsion is, in theory at least, not a punishment,
but an administrative measure consisting in an
order of the Government directing a foreigner to leave
the country. Expulsion must therefore be effected
with as much forbearance and indulgence as the circumstances
and conditions of the case allow and demand,
especially when compulsion is meted out to a domiciled
alien. And the home State of the expelled, by its right
of protection over its citizens abroad, may well insist
upon such forbearance and indulgence. But this is
valid as regards the first expulsion only. Should the
expelled refuse to leave the territory voluntarily or,
after having left, return without authorisation, he may
be arrested, punished, and forcibly brought to the
frontier.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Reconduction in Contradistinction to Expulsion.</p></div>
<p>§ 326. <a id="In_many_Continental_States326"></a>In many Continental States destitute aliens,
foreign vagabonds, suspicious aliens without papers of
legitimation, alien criminals who have served their
punishment, and the like, are without any formalities
arrested by the police and reconducted to the frontier.
There is no doubt that the competence for such reconduction,
which is often called <i>droit de renvoi</i>, is an inference
from the territorial supremacy of every State,
for there is no reason whatever why a State should not
get rid of such undesirable aliens as speedily as possible.
But although such reconduction is materially
not much different from expulsion, it nevertheless
differs much from this in form, since expulsion is an
order to leave the country, whereas reconduction is
forcible conveying away of foreigners.<a id="FNanchor_662_662"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_662_662">[662]</a> The home State
of such reconducted aliens has the duty to receive
them, since, as will be remembered,<a id="FNanchor_663_663"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_663_663">[663]</a> a State cannot
refuse to receive such of its subjects as are expelled
from abroad. Difficulties arise, however, sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
concerning the reconduction of such alien individuals
as have lost their nationality through long-continued
absence<a id="FNanchor_664_664"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_664_664">[664]</a> from home without having acquired another
nationality abroad. Such cases are a further example
of the fact that the very existence of stateless individuals
is a blemish in Municipal as well as International
Law.<a id="FNanchor_665_665"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_665_665">[665]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Extradition no legal duty.</p></div>
<p>§ 327. Extradition is the delivery of a prosecuted
individual to the State on whose territory he has committed
a crime by the State on whose territory the
criminal is for the time staying. Although Grotius<a id="FNanchor_666_666"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_666_666">[666]</a>
holds that every State has the duty either to punish
or to surrender to the prosecuting State such individuals
within its boundaries as have committed
a crime abroad, and although there is as regards the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
majority of such cases an important interest of civilised
mankind that this should be done, this rule of Grotius
has never been adopted by the States and has, therefore,
never become a rule of the Law of Nations. On
the contrary, States have always upheld their competence
to grant asylum to foreign individuals as an
inference from their territorial supremacy, those cases,
of course, excepted which fall under stipulations of
special extradition treaties, if any. There is, therefore,
no universal rule of customary International Law in
existence which commands<a id="FNanchor_667_667"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_667_667">[667]</a> extradition.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_666_666"></a><a href="#FNanchor_666_666" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[666]</span></a> II. c. 21, § 4.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_667_667"></a><a href="#FNanchor_667_667" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[667]</span></a> Clarke, op. cit. pp. 1-15, tries to prove that a duty to
extradite criminals does exist, but the result of all his labour is that
he finds that the refusal of extradition is "a serious violation of the
moral obligations which exist between civilised States" (see p. 14). But
nobody has ever denied this as far as the ordinary criminal is
concerned. The question is only whether an international <i>legal</i> duty
exists to surrender a criminal. And this <i>legal</i> duty States have always
denied.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Extradition Treaties how arisen.</p></div>
<p>§ 328. Since, however, modern civilisation categorically
demands extradition of criminals as a rule, numerous
treaties have been concluded between the several
States stipulating the cases in which extradition shall
take place. According to these treaties, individuals prosecuted
for the more important crimes, political crimes
excepted, are actually always surrendered to the prosecuting
State, if not punished locally. But this solution
of the problem of extradition is a product of the nineteenth
century only. Before the eighteenth century
extradition of ordinary criminals hardly ever occurred,
although many States used then frequently to surrender
to each other political fugitives, heretics, and even emigrants,
either in consequence of special treaties stipulating
the surrender of such individuals, or voluntarily
without such treaties. Matters began to undergo a
change in the eighteenth century, for then treaties
between neighbouring States frequently stipulated extradition
of ordinary criminals besides that of political
fugitives, conspirators, military deserters, and the like.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
Vattel (II. § 76) is able to assert in 1758 that murderers,
incendiaries, and thieves are regularly surrendered by
neighbouring States to each other. But general treaties
of extradition between all the members of the Family
of Nations did not exist in the eighteenth century, and
there was hardly a necessity for such general treaties,
since traffic was not so developed as nowadays and
fugitive criminals seldom succeeded in reaching a foreign
territory beyond that of a neighbouring State. When,
however, in the nineteenth century, with the appearance
of railways and Transatlantic steamships, transit
began to develop immensely, criminals used the opportunity
to flee to distant foreign countries. It was then
and thereby that the conviction was forced upon the
States of civilised humanity that it was in their common
interest to surrender ordinary criminals regularly
to each other. General treaties of extradition became,
therefore, a necessity, and the several States succeeded
in concluding such treaties with each other. There is
no civilised State in existence nowadays which has not
concluded such treaties with the majority of the other
civilised States. And the consequence is that, although
no universal rule of International Law commands it,
extradition of criminals between States is an established
fact based on treaties. The present condition of
affairs is, however, very unsatisfactory, since there are
many hundreds of treaties in existence which do not
at all agree in their details. What is required nowadays,
and what will certainly be realised in the near future,
is a universal treaty of extradition, one single treaty
to which all the civilised States become parties.<a id="FNanchor_668_668"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_668_668">[668]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_668_668"></a><a href="#FNanchor_668_668" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[668]</span></a> The Second Pan-American Conference of 1902 produced a
treaty of extradition which was signed by twelve States, namely, the
United States of America, Colombia, Costa Rica, Chili, San Domingo,
Ecuador, Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, and Nicaragua,
but this treaty has not been ratified; see the text in "Annuaire de la
Vie Internationale" (1908-9), p. 461.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Municipal Extradition Laws.</p></div>
<p>§ 329. Some States, however, were unwilling to depend<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
entirely upon the discretion of their Governments
as regards the conclusion of extradition treaties and
the procedure in extradition cases. They have therefore
enacted special Municipal Laws which enumerate
those crimes for which extradition shall be granted and
asked in return, and which at the same time regulate
the procedure in extradition cases. These Municipal
Laws<a id="FNanchor_669_669"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_669_669">[669]</a> furnish the basis for the conclusion of extradition
treaties. The first in the field with such an extradition
law was Belgium in 1833, which remained, however,
for far more than a generation quite isolated. It
was not until 1870 that England followed the example
given by Belgium. English public opinion was for
many years against extradition treaties at all, considering
them as a great danger to individual liberty and to
the competence of every State to grant asylum to
political refugees. This country possessed, therefore,
before 1870 a few extradition treaties only, which
moreover were in many points inadequate. But in
1870 the British Government succeeded in getting
Parliament to pass the Extradition Act.<a id="FNanchor_670_670"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_670_670">[670]</a> This Act,
which was amended by another in 1873<a id="FNanchor_671_671"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_671_671">[671]</a> and a third
in 1895,<a id="FNanchor_672_672"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_672_672">[672]</a> has furnished the basis for extradition treaties
of Great Britain with forty other States.<a id="FNanchor_673_673"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_673_673">[673]</a> Belgium
enacted a new extradition law in 1874. Holland enacted
such a law in 1875, Luxemburg in the same
year, Argentina in 1885, the Congo Free State in 1886,
Peru in 1888, Switzerland in 1892.</p>

well as Biron and Chalmers. Not to be confounded with extradition of
criminals to foreign States is extradition within the British Empire
from one part of the British dominions to another. This matter is
regulated by the Fugitive Offenders Act, 1881 (44 &amp; 45 Vict. c. 169).</p></div>
<p>Such States as possess no extradition laws and
whose written Constitution does not mention the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
matter, leave it to their Governments to conclude
extradition treaties according to their discretion. And
in these countries the Governments are competent to
extradite an individual even if no extradition treaty
exists.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Object of Extradition.</p></div>
<p>§ 330. Since extradition is the delivery of an incriminated
individual to the State on whose territory
he has committed a crime by the State on whose territory
he is for the time staying, the object of extradition
can be any individual, whether he is a subject
of the prosecuting State, or of the State which is required
to extradite him, or of a third State. Many
States, however, as France and most other States of
the European continent, have adopted the principle
never to extradite one of their subjects to a foreign
State, but themselves to punish subjects of their own
for grave crimes committed abroad. Other States, as
Great Britain and the United States, have not adopted
this principle, and do extradite such of their subjects
as have committed a grave crime abroad. Thus Great
Britain surrendered in 1879 to Austria, where he was
convicted and hanged,<a id="FNanchor_674_674"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_674_674">[674]</a> one Tourville, a British subject,
who, after having murdered his wife in the Tyrol, had
fled home to England. And it must be emphasised
that the object of extradition is an individual who has
committed a crime abroad, whether or not he was
during the commission of the criminal act physically
present on the territory of the State where the crime was
committed. Thus, in 1884, Great Britain surrendered
one Nillins to Germany, who, by sending from Southampton
forged bills of exchange to a merchant in Germany
as payment for goods ordered, was considered to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
have committed forgery and to have obtained goods
by false pretences in Germany.<a id="FNanchor_675_675"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_675_675">[675]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_674_674"></a><a href="#FNanchor_674_674" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[674]</span></a> This case is all the more remarkable, as (see
 24 &amp; 25 Vict.
c. 100, § 9) the criminal law of England extends over murder and
manslaughter committed abroad by English subjects, and as, according to
article 3 of the extradition treaty of 1873 between England and
Austria-Hungary, the contracting parties are in no case under obligation
to extradite their own subjects.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_675_675"></a><a href="#FNanchor_675_675" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[675]</span></a> See
 Clarke, op. cit. pp. 177 and 262, who, however,
disapproves of this surrender.</p></div>
<p>A conflict between International and Municipal Law
arises if a certain individual must be extradited according
to an extradition treaty, but cannot be extradited
according to the Municipal Law of the State from which
extradition is demanded. Thus in the case of Salvatore
Paladini,<a id="FNanchor_676_676"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_676_676">[676]</a> whose extradition was demanded by the
United States of America from the Italian Government
in 1888 for having passed counterfeit money, Italian
Municipal Law, which prohibits the extradition of an
Italian citizen, came into conflict with article 1 of the
Extradition Treaty of 1868 between Italy and the
United States which stipulates extradition of criminals
without exempting nationals. For this reason Italy refused
to extradite Paladini. It is noteworthy that the
United States, although they do not any longer press
for extradition of Italian subjects who, after having
committed a crime in the United States have returned
to Italy, nevertheless consider themselves bound by
the above-mentioned treaty of 1868 to extradite to
Italy such American subjects as have committed a crime
in Italy. Therefore, when in 1910 the Italian Government
demanded from the United States extradition of
one Porter Charlton,<a id="FNanchor_677_677"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_677_677">[677]</a> an American citizen, for having
committed a murder in Italy, extradition was granted.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_676_676"></a><a href="#FNanchor_676_676" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[676]</span></a> See

 A.J. V. (1911), pp. 182-191.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Extraditable Crimes.</p></div>
<p>§ 331. Unless a State is restricted by an extradition
law, it can grant extradition for any crime it thinks
fit. And unless a State is bound by an extradition
treaty, it can refuse extradition for any crime. Such
States as possess extradition laws frame their extradition
treaties conformably therewith and specify in
those treaties all those crimes for which they are willing
to grant extradition. And no person is to be extradited<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
whose deed is not a crime according to the
Criminal Law of the State which is asked to extradite,
as well as of the State which demands extradition.
As regards Great Britain, the following are extraditable
crimes according to the Extradition Act of 1870:—Murder
and manslaughter; counterfeiting and uttering
counterfeit money; forgery and uttering what is
forged; embezzlement and larceny; obtaining goods
or money by false pretences; crimes by bankrupts
against bankruptcy laws; fraud by a bailee, banker,
agent, factor, trustee, or by a director, or member, or
public officer of any company; rape; abduction; child
stealing; burglary and housebreaking; arson; robbery
with violence; threats with intent to extort;
piracy by the Law of Nations; sinking or destroying a
vessel at sea; assaults on board ship on the High Seas
with intent to destroy life or to do grievous bodily
harm; revolt or conspiracy against the authority of
the master on board a ship on the High Seas. The
Extradition Acts of 1873 and 1906 added the following
crimes to the list:—Kidnapping, false imprisonment,
perjury, subornation of perjury, and bribery.</p>
<p>Political criminals are, as a rule, not extradited,<a id="FNanchor_678_678"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_678_678">[678]</a>
and according to many extradition treaties military
deserters and such persons as have committed offences
against religion are likewise excluded from extradition.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_678_678"></a><a href="#FNanchor_678_678" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[678]</span></a> See

<div class="sidenote"><p>Effectuation and Condition of Extradition.</p></div>
<p>§ 332. Extradition is granted only if asked for, and
after the formalities have taken place which are stipulated
in the treaties of extradition and the extradition
laws, if any. It is effected through handing over the
criminal by the police of the extraditing State to the
police of the prosecuting State. But it must be emphasised
that, according to most extradition treaties, it is
a condition that the extradited individual shall be tried
and punished for those crimes exclusively for which his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
extradition has been asked and granted, or for those at
least which the extradition treaty concerned enumerates.<a id="FNanchor_679_679"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_679_679">[679]</a>
If, nevertheless, an extradited individual is tried
and punished for another crime, the extraditing State
has a right of intervention.<a id="FNanchor_680_680"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_680_680">[680]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_679_679"></a><a href="#FNanchor_679_679" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[679]</span></a> See

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_680_680"></a><a href="#FNanchor_680_680" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[680]</span></a> It ought to be mentioned that the Institute of
International Law in 1880, at its meeting in Oxford (see Annuaire, V. p.
117), adopted a body of twenty-six rules concerning extradition.</p></div>
<p>An important question is whether, in case a criminal,
who has succeeded in escaping into the territory of
another State, is erroneously handed over, without the
formalities of extradition having been complied with,
by the police of the local State to the police of the
prosecuting State, such local State can demand that the
prosecuting State shall send the criminal back and ask
for his formal extradition. This question was decided
in the negative in February 1911 by the Court of Arbitration
at the Hague in the case of France <i>v.</i> Great
Britain concerning Savarkar. This British-Indian subject,
who was prosecuted for high treason and abatement
of murder, and was being transported in the P. and O.
boat <i>Morea</i> to India for the purpose of standing his
trial there, escaped to the shore on October 25, 1910,
while the vessel was in the harbour of Marseilles. He
was, however, seized by a French policeman, who, erroneously
and without further formalities, reconducted
him to the <i>Morea</i> with the assistance of individuals
from the vessel who had raised a hue-and-cry. Since
Savarkar was <i>prima facie</i> a political criminal, France
demanded that England should give him up and should
request his extradition in a formal way, but England
refused to comply with this demand, and the parties,
therefore, agreed to have the conflict decided by the
Court of Arbitration at the Hague. The award, while
admitting that an irregularity had been committed by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
the reconduction of Savarkar to the British vessel,
decided, correctly, I believe, in favour of Great Britain,
asserting that there was no rule of International Law
imposing, in circumstances such as those which have
been set out above, any obligation on the Power which

<div class="sidenote"><p>How Non-extradition of Political Criminals became the Rule.</p></div>
<p>§ 333. <a id="Before_the_French333"></a>Before the French Revolution<a id="FNanchor_682_682"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_682_682">[682]</a> the term
"political crime" was unknown in either the theory
or the practice of the Law of Nations. And the principle
of non-extradition of political criminals was likewise
non-existent. On the contrary, whereas extradition<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
of ordinary criminals was, before the eighteenth
century at least, hardly ever stipulated, treaties very
often stipulated the extradition of individuals who had
committed such deeds as are nowadays termed "political
crimes," and such individuals were frequently
extradited even when no treaty stipulated it.<a id="FNanchor_683_683"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_683_683">[683]</a> And
writers in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries did
not at all object to such practice on the part of the
States; on the contrary, they frequently approved of
it.<a id="FNanchor_684_684"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_684_684">[684]</a> It is indirectly due to the French Revolution that
matters gradually underwent a change, since this event
was the starting-point for the revolt in the nineteenth
century against despotism and absolutism throughout
the western part of the European continent. It was
then that the term "political crime" arose, and article
120 of the French Constitution of 1793 granted asylum
to foreigners exiled from their home country "for the
cause of liberty." On the other hand, the French
emigrants, who had fled from France to escape the
Reign of Terror, found an asylum in foreign States.
However, the modern principle of non-extradition of
political criminals even then did not conquer the world.
Until 1830 political criminals frequently were extradited.
But public opinion in free countries began gradually to
revolt against such extradition, and Great Britain was
its first opponent. The fact that several political
fugitives were surrendered by the Governor of Gibraltar
to Spain created a storm of indignation in Parliament
in 1815, where Sir James Mackintosh proclaimed the
principle that no nation ought to refuse asylum to
political fugitives. And in 1816 Lord Castlereagh declared
that there could be no greater abuse of the law
than by allowing it to be the instrument of inflicting
punishment on foreigners who had committed political<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
crimes only. The second in the field was Switzerland,
the asylum for many political fugitives from neighbouring
countries, when, after the final defeat of
Napoleon, the reactionary Continental monarchs refused
the introduction of constitutional reforms which were
demanded by their peoples. And although, in 1823,
Switzerland was forced by threats of the reactionary
leading Powers of the Holy Alliance to restrict somewhat
the asylum afforded by her to individuals who had
taken part in the unsuccessful political revolts in Naples
and Piedmont, the principle of non-extradition went
on fighting its way. The question as to that asylum
was discussed with much passion in the press of Europe.
And although the principle of non-extradition was far
from becoming universally recognised, that discussion
indirectly fostered its growth. A practical proof thereof
is that in 1830 even Austria and Prussia, two of the
reactionary Powers of that time, refused Russia's
demand for extradition of fugitives who had taken
part in the Polish Revolution of that year. And another
proof thereof is that at about the same time, in
1829, a celebrated dissertation<a id="FNanchor_685_685"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_685_685">[685]</a> by a Dutch jurist made
its appearance, in which the principle of non-extradition
of political criminals was for the first time defended
with juristic arguments and on a juristic basis.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a reaction set in in 1833, when
Austria, Prussia, and Russia concluded treaties which
remained in force for a generation, and which stipulated
that henceforth individuals who had committed crimes
of high treason and <i>lèse-majesté</i>, or had conspired against
the safety of the throne and the legitimate Government,
or had taken part in a revolt, should be surrendered
to the State concerned. The same year, however, is
epoch-making in favour of the principle of non-extradition
of political criminals, for in 1833 Belgium enacted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
her celebrated extradition law, the first of its kind,
being the very first Municipal Law which expressly
interdicted the extradition of foreign political criminals.
As Belgium, which had seceded from the Netherlands
in 1830 and became recognised and neutralised by the
Powers in 1831, owed her very existence to revolt, she
felt the duty of making it a principle of her Municipal
Law to grant asylum to foreign political fugitives, a
principle which was for the first time put into practice
in the treaty of extradition concluded in 1834 between
Belgium and France. The latter, which to the present
day has no municipal extradition law, has nevertheless
henceforth always in her extradition treaties with other
Powers stipulated the principle of non-extradition of
political criminals. And the other Powers followed
gradually. Even Russia had to give way, and since
1867 this principle is to be found in all extradition
treaties of Russia with other Powers, that with Spain
of 1888 excepted. It is due to the stern attitude of
Great Britain, Switzerland, Belgium, France, and the
United States that the principle has conquered the
world. These countries, in which individual liberty is
the very basis of all political life, and constitutional
government a political dogma of the nation, watched
with abhorrence the methods of government of many
other States between 1815 and 1860. These Governments
were more or less absolute and despotic, repressing
by force every endeavour of their subjects to obtain
individual liberty and a share in the government.
Thousands of the most worthy citizens and truest
patriots had to leave their country for fear of severe
punishment for political crimes. Great Britain and
the other free countries felt in honour bound not to
surrender such exiled patriots to the persecution of
their Governments, but to grant them an asylum.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Difficulty concerning the Conception of Political Crime.</p></div>
<p>§ 334. Although the principle became and is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
generally<a id="FNanchor_686_686"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_686_686">[686]</a> recognised that political criminals shall not
be extradited, serious difficulties exist concerning the
conception of "political crime." Such conception is of
great importance, as the extradition of a criminal may
depend upon it. It is unnecessary here to discuss the
numerous details of the controversy. It suffices to
state that whereas many writers call such crime "political"
as was committed from a political motive, others
call "political" any crime committed for a political
purpose; again, others recognise such crime only as
"political" as was committed from a political motive
and at the same time for a political purpose; and,
thirdly, some writers confine the term "political crime"
to certain offences against the State only, as high
treason, <i>lèse-majesté</i>, and the like.<a id="FNanchor_687_687"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_687_687">[687]</a> To the present day
all attempts have failed to formulate a satisfactory
conception of the term, and the reason of the thing
will, I believe, for ever exclude the possibility of finding
a satisfactory conception and definition.<a id="FNanchor_688_688"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_688_688">[688]</a> The difficulty
is caused through the so-called "relative political
crimes" or <i>délits complexes</i>—namely, those complex
cases in which the political offence comprises at the
same time<a id="FNanchor_689_689"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_689_689">[689]</a> an ordinary crime, such as murder, arson,
theft, and the like. Some writers deny categorically
that such complex crimes are political; but this opinion
is wrong and dangerous, since indeed many honourable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
political criminals would have to be extradited in
consequence thereof. On the other hand, it cannot be
denied that many cases of complex crimes, although
the deed may have been committed from a political
motive or for a political purpose, are such as ought not
to be considered political. Such cases have roused the
indignation of the whole civilised world, and have indeed
endangered the very value of the principle of non-extradition
of political criminals. Three practical
attempts have therefore been made to deal with such
complex crimes without violating this principle.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_689_689"></a><a href="#FNanchor_689_689" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[689]</span></a> The problem came twice before the English courts; see
 <i>Ex

[1894] 2 Q.B. 415. In the case of Castione, a Swiss who had taken part
in a revolutionary movement in the canton of Ticino and had incidentally
shot a member of the Government, the Court refused extradition because
the crime was considered to be political. On the other hand, in the case
of Meunier, a French anarchist who was prosecuted for having caused two
explosions in France, one of which resulted in the death of two
individuals, the extradition was granted because the crime was not
considered to be political.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>The so-called Belgian <i>Attentat</i> Clause.</p></div>
<p>§ 335. The first attempt was the enactment of the
so-called <i>attentat</i> clause by Belgium in 1856,<a id="FNanchor_690_690"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_690_690">[690]</a> following
the case of Jacquin in 1854. A French manufacturer
named Jules Jacquin, domiciled in Belgium, and a
foreman of his factory named Célestin Jacquin, who
was also a Frenchman, tried to cause an explosion on
the railway line between Lille and Calais with the
intention of murdering the Emperor Napoleon III.
France requested the extradition of the two criminals,
but the Belgian Court of Appeal had to refuse the surrender
on account of the Belgian extradition law interdicting
the surrender of political criminals. To provide
for such cases in the future, Belgium enacted in 1856
a law amending her extradition law and stipulating that
murder of the head of a foreign Government or of a
member of his family should not be considered a political
crime. Gradually all European States, with the exception
of England and Switzerland, have adopted that
<i>attentat</i> clause, and a great many Continental writers
urge its adoption by the whole of the civilised world.<a id="FNanchor_691_691"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_691_691">[691]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>The Russian Project of 1881.</p></div>
<p>§ 336. Another attempt to deal with complex crimes
without detriment to the principle of non-extradition
of political criminals was made by Russia in 1881.
Influenced by the murder of the Emperor Alexander<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
II. in that year, Russia invited the Powers to hold an
International Conference at Brussels for the consideration
of the proposal that thenceforth no murder or
attempt to murder ought to be considered as a political
crime. But the Conference did not take place, since
Great Britain as well as France declined to take part
in it.<a id="FNanchor_692_692"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_692_692">[692]</a> Thus the development of things had come to a
standstill, many States having adopted, others declining
to adopt, the Belgian clause, and the Russian
proposal having fallen through.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>The Swiss Solution of the Problem in 1892.</p></div>
<p>§ 337. Eleven years later, in 1892, Switzerland
attempted a solution of the problem on a new basis.
In that year Switzerland enacted an extradition law
whose article 10 recognises the non-extradition of
political criminals, but at the same time lays down the
rule that political criminals shall nevertheless be surrendered
in case the chief feature of the offence wears
more the aspect of an ordinary than of a political crime,
and that the decision concerning the extraditability of
such criminals rests with the "Bundesgericht," the
highest Swiss Court of Justice. This Swiss rule contains
a better solution of the problem than the Belgian <i>attentat</i>
clause in so far as it allows the circumstances of the
special case to be taken into consideration. And the fact
that the decision is taken out of the hands of the Government
and transferred to the highest Court of the country,
denotes likewise a remarkable progress.<a id="FNanchor_693_693"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_693_693">[693]</a> For the Government
cannot now be blamed whether extradition is
granted or refused, the decision of an independent Court

satisfaction.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span></p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Rationale for the Principle of Non-extradition of Political
Criminals.</p></div>
<p>§ 338. The numerous attempts<a id="FNanchor_695_695"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_695_695">[695]</a> against the lives of
heads of States and the frequency of anarchistic crimes
have shaken the value of the principle of non-extradition
of political criminals in the opinion of the civilised
world as illustrated by the three practical attempts
described above to meet certain difficulties. It is,
consequently, no wonder that some writers<a id="FNanchor_696_696"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_696_696">[696]</a> plead
openly and directly for the abolition of this principle,
maintaining that it was only the product of abnormal
times and circumstances such as were in existence
during the first half of the nineteenth century, and that
with their disappearance the principle is likely to do
more harm than good. And indeed it cannot be denied
that the application of the principle in favour of some
criminals, such as anarchistic<a id="FNanchor_697_697"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_697_697">[697]</a> murderers and bomb-throwers,
could only be called an abuse. But the question
is whether, apart from such exceptional cases, the
principle itself is still to be considered as justified or not.</p>

pp. 306-336.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span></p></div>
<p>Without doubt the answer must be in the affirmative.
I readily admit that every political crime is by
no means an honourable deed, which as such deserves
protection. Still, political crimes are committed by
the best of patriots, and, what is of more weight, they
are in many cases a consequence of oppression on the
part of the respective Governments. They are comparatively
infrequent in free countries, where there is
individual liberty, where the nation governs itself, and
where, therefore, there are plenty of legal ways to bring
grievances before the authorities. A free country can
never agree to surrender foreigners to their prosecuting
home State for deeds done in the interest of the same
freedom and liberty which the subjects of such free
country enjoy. For individual liberty and self-government
of nations are demanded by modern civilisation,
and their gradual realisation over the whole globe is
conducive to the welfare of the human race.</p>
<p>Political crimes may certainly be committed in the
interest of reaction as well as in the interest of progress,
and reactionary political criminals may have occasion
to ask for asylum as well as progressive political criminals.
The principle of non-extradition of political
criminals indeed extends its protection over the former
too, and this is the very point where the value of the
principle reveals itself. For no State has a right to
interfere with the internal affairs of another State, and,
if a State were to surrender reactionary political criminals
but not progressive ones, the prosecuting State
of the latter could indeed complain and consider the
refusal of extradition an unfriendly act. If, however,
non-extradition is made a general principle which finds
its application in favour of political criminals of every
kind, no State can complain if extradition is refused.
Have not reactionary States the same faculty of refusing
the extradition of reactionary political criminals as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
free States have of refusing the extradition of progressive
political criminals?</p>
<p>Now, many writers agree upon this point, but maintain
that such arguments meet the so-called purely
political crimes only, and not the relative or complex
political crimes, and they contend, therefore, that the
principle of non-extradition ought to be restricted to
the former crimes only. But to this I cannot assent.
No revolt happens without such complex crimes taking
place, and the individuals who commit them may indeed
deserve the same protection as other political criminals.
And, further, although I can under no circumstances
approve of murder, can never sympathise with a murderer,
and can never pardon his crime, it may well be
the case that the murdered official or head of a State
has by inhuman cruelty and oppression himself whetted
the knife which cut short his span of life. On the other
hand, the mere fact that a crime was committed for a
political purpose may well be without any importance
in comparison with its detestability and heinousness.
Attempts on heads of States, such, for example, as the
murders of Presidents Lincoln and Carnot or of Alexander
II. of Russia and Humbert of Italy, are as a rule,
and all anarchistic crimes are without any exception,
crimes of that kind. Criminals who commit such
crimes ought under no circumstances to find protection
and asylum, but ought to be surrendered for the purpose
of receiving their just and appropriate punishment.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>How to
avoid Misapplication
of the
Principle
of Non-extradition
of Political
Criminals.</p></div>
<p>§ 339. The question, however, is how to sift the chaff
from the wheat, how to distinguish between such political
criminals as deserve an asylum and such as do
not. The difficulties are great and partly insuperable
as long as we do not succeed in finding a satisfactory
conception of the term "political crime." But such
difficulties are only partly, not wholly, insuperable.
The step taken by the Swiss extradition law of 1892 is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
so far in advance as to meet a great many of the difficulties.
There is no doubt that the adoption of the
Swiss rule by all the other civilised States would improve
matters more than the universal adoption of the
so-called Belgian <i>attentat</i> clause. The fact that according
to Swiss law each case of complex political crime is
unravelled and obtains the verdict of an independent
Court according to the very circumstances, conditions,
and requirements under which it occurred, is of the
greatest value. It enables every case to be met in such
a way as it deserves, without compromising the Government,
and without sacrificing the principle of non-extradition
of political criminals as a valuable rule. I cannot
support the charge made by some writers<a id="FNanchor_698_698"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_698_698">[698]</a> that the Swiss
law is inadequate because it does not give criteria for
the guidance of the Court in deciding whether or no
extradition for complex crimes should be granted. In
my opinion, the very absence of such criteria proves the
superiority of the Swiss clause to the Belgian <i>attentat</i>
clause. On the one hand, the latter is quite insufficient,
for it restricts its stipulations to murder of heads of
States and members of their families only. But I see
no reason why individuals guilty of any murder—as
provided by the Russian proposal—or who have committed
other crimes, such as arson, theft, and the like,
should not be surrendered in case the political motive
or purpose of the crime is of no importance in comparison
with the crime itself. On the other hand, the
Belgian clause goes too far, since exceptional cases of
murder of heads of States from political motives or for
political purposes might occur which do not deserve
extradition. The Swiss clause, however, with its absence
of fixed distinctions between such complex crimes
as are extraditable, and such as are not, permits the
consideration of the circumstances, conditions, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
requirements under which a complex crime was committed.
It is true that the responsibility of the Court
of Justice which has to decide whether such a complex
crime is extraditable is great. But it is to be taken
for granted that such Court will give its decision with
impartiality, fairness, and justice. And it need not be
feared that such Court will grant asylum to a murderer,
incendiary, and the like, unless convinced that the deed
was really political.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_698_698"></a><a href="#FNanchor_698_698" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[698]</span></a> See,

<div class="sidenote"><p>Reactionary Extradition Treaties.</p></div>
<p>§ 340. <a id="Be_that_as_it_may340"></a>Be that as it may, the present condition of
matters is a danger to the very principle of non-extradition
of political criminals. Under the influence of
the excitement caused by numerous criminal attempts
in the last quarter of the nineteenth century, a few
treaties have already been concluded which make a
wide breach in this principle. It is Russia which is
leading the reaction. This Power in 1885 concluded
treaties with Prussia and Bavaria which stipulate the
extradition of all individuals who have made an attack
on the life, the body, or the honour<a id="FNanchor_699_699"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_699_699">[699]</a> of a monarch, or
of a member of his family, or who have committed any
kind of murder or attempt to murder. And the extradition
treaty between Russia and Spain of 1888 goes
even further and abandons the principle of non-extradition
of political criminals altogether. Fortunately,
the endeavour of Russia to abolish this principle altogether
has not succeeded. In her extradition treaty
with Great Britain of 1886 she had to adopt it without
any restriction, and in her extradition treaties with
Portugal of 1887, with Luxemburg of 1892, and with
the United States and Holland of 1893, she had to
adopt it with a restrictive clause similar to the Belgian
<i>attentat</i> clause.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Necessity of a Head for every State.</p></div>
<p>§ 341. As a State is an abstraction from the fact
that a multitude of individuals live in a country under
a Sovereign Government, every State must have a head
as its highest organ, which represents it within and
without its borders in the totality of its relations. Such
head is the monarch in a monarchy and a president or
a body of individuals, as the Bundesrath of Switzerland,
in a republic. The Law of Nations prescribes no rules
as regards the kind of head a State may have. Every
State is, naturally, independent regarding this point,
possessing the faculty of adopting any Constitution it
likes and of changing such Constitution according to its
discretion. Some kind or other of a head of the State
is, however, necessary according to International Law,
as without a head there is no State in existence, but
anarchy.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Recognition of Heads of States.</p></div>
<p>§ 342. In case of the accession of a new head of a
State, other States are as a rule notified. The latter
usually recognise the new head through some formal
act, such as a congratulation. But neither such
notification nor recognition is strictly necessary according<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
to International Law, as an individual becomes
head of a State, not through the recognition of
other States, but through Municipal Law. Such notification
and recognition are, however, of legal importance.
For through notification a State declares that
the individual concerned is its highest organ, and has
by Municipal Law the power to represent the State in
the totality of its international relations. And through
recognition the other States declare that they are ready
to negotiate with such individual as the highest organ
of his State. But recognition of a new head by other
States is in every respect a matter of discretion. Neither
has a State the right to demand from other States
recognition of its new head, nor has any State a right
to refuse such recognition. Thus Russia, Austria, and
Prussia refused until 1848 recognition to Isabella, Queen
of Spain, who had come to the throne as an infant in
1833. But, practically, in the long run recognition cannot
be withheld, for without it international intercourse
is impossible, and States with self-respect will exercise
retorsion if recognition is refused to the heads they
have chosen. Thus, when, after the unification of Italy
in 1861, Mecklenburg and Bavaria refused the recognition
of Victor Emanuel as King of Italy, Count Cavour
revoked the <i>exequatur</i> of the consuls of these States in
Italy.</p>
<p>But it must be emphasised that recognition of a
new head of a State by no means implies the recognition
of such head as the legitimate head of the State
in question. Recognition is in fact nothing else than
the declaration of other States that they are ready to
deal with a certain individual as the highest organ of
the particular State, and the question remains totally
undecided whether such individual is or is not to be
considered the legitimate head of that State.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Competence of Heads of States.</p></div>
<p>§ 343. The head of a State, as its chief organ and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
representative in the totality of its international relations,
acts for his State in the latter's international
intercourse, with the consequence that all his legally
relevant international acts are considered acts of his
State. His competence to perform such acts is termed
<i>jus repraesentationis omnimodae</i>. It comprises in substance
chiefly: reception and mission of diplomatic
agents and consuls, conclusion of international treaties,
declaration of war, and conclusion of peace. But it is
a question of the special case, how far this competence
is independent of Municipal Law. For heads of States
exercise this competence for their States and as the
latter's representatives, and not in their own right. If
a head of a State should, for instance, ratify a treaty
without the necessary approval of his Parliament, he
would go beyond his powers, and therefore such treaty
would not be binding upon his State.<a id="FNanchor_700_700"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_700_700">[700]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_700_700"></a><a href="#FNanchor_700_700" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[700]</span></a> See
 below, § <a href="#Al497" class="pginternal">497</a>.</p></div>
<p>On the other hand, this competence is certainly independent
of the question whether a head of a State is
the legitimate head or a usurper. The mere fact that
an individual is for the time being the head of a State
makes him competent to act as such head, and his State
is legally bound by his acts. It may, however, be difficult
to decide whether a certain individual is or is not
the head of a State, for after a revolution some time
always elapses before matters are settled.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Heads of States Objects of the Law of Nations.</p></div>
<p>§ 344. <a id="Heads_of_States344"></a>Heads of States are never subjects<a id="FNanchor_701_701"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_701_701">[701]</a> of the
Law of Nations. The position a head of a State has
according to International Law is due to him, not as
an individual, but as the head of his State. His position
is derived from international rights and duties of
his State, and not from international rights of his own.
Consequently, all rights possessed by heads of States<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
abroad are not international rights, but rights which
must be granted to them by the Municipal Law of the
foreign State on whose territory such foreign heads of
States are temporarily staying, and such rights must be
granted in compliance with international rights of the
home States of the respective heads. Thus, heads of
States are not subjects but objects of International
Law, and in this regard are like any other individual.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_701_701"></a><a href="#FNanchor_701_701" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[701]</span></a> But Heffter (§ 48) maintains the contrary, and Phillimore
(II. § 100) designates monarchs <i>mediately and derivatively</i> as subjects
of International Law. The matter is treated in detail above, §§ 13 and
288-290; see also
 below, § <a href="#Diplomatic_envoys384" class="pginternal">384</a>.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Honours and Privileges of Heads of States.</p></div>
<p>§ 345. All honours and privileges of heads of States
due to them by foreign States are derived from the fact
that dignity is a recognised quality of States as members
of the Family of Nations and International Persons.<a id="FNanchor_702_702"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_702_702">[702]</a>
Concerning such honours and privileges, International
Law distinguishes between monarchs and heads of
republics. This distinction is the necessary outcome of
the fact that the position of monarchs according to the
Municipal Law of monarchies is totally different from
the position of heads of republics according to the
Municipal Law of the republics. For monarchs are
sovereigns, but heads of republics are not.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Sovereignty of Monarchs.</p></div>
<p>§ 346. In every monarchy the monarch appears as
the representative of the sovereignty of the State and
thereby becomes a Sovereign himself, a fact which is
recognised by International Law. And the difference
between the Municipal Laws of the different States<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
regarding this point matters in no way. Consequently,
International Law recognises all monarchs as equally
sovereign, although the difference between the constitutional
positions of monarchs is enormous, if looked
upon in the light of the rules laid down by the Constitutional
Laws of the different States. Thus, the Emperor
of Russia, whose powers are very wide, and the King of
England, who is sovereign in Parliament only, and
whose powers are therefore very much restricted, are
indifferently sovereign according to International Law.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Consideration due to Monarchs at home.</p></div>
<p>§ 347. Not much need be said as regards the consideration
due to a monarch from other States when
within the boundaries of his own State. Foreign States
have to give him his usual and recognised predicates<a id="FNanchor_703_703"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_703_703">[703]</a>
in all official communications. Every monarch must
be treated as a peer of other monarchs, whatever difference
in title and actual power there may be between
them.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_703_703"></a><a href="#FNanchor_703_703" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[703]</span></a> Details as regards the predicates of monarchs are given

<div class="sidenote"><p>Consideration due to Monarchs abroad.</p></div>
<p>§ 348. <a id="As_regards_however348"></a>As regards, however, the consideration due
to a monarch abroad from the State on whose territory
he is staying in time of peace and with the consent and
the knowledge of the Government, details must necessarily
be given. The consideration due to him consists
in honours, inviolability, and exterritoriality.</p>
<p>(1) In consequence of his character of Sovereign,
his home State has the right to demand that certain
ceremonial honours be rendered to him, the members
of his family, and the members of his retinue. He
must be addressed by his usual predicates. Military
salutes must be paid to him, and the like.</p>
<p>(2) As his person is sacrosanct, his home State has
a right to insist that he be afforded special protection
as regards personal safety, the maintenance of personal
dignity, and the unrestrained intercourse with his
Government at home. Every offence against him must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
be visited with specially severe penalties. On the other
hand, he must be exempt from every kind of criminal
jurisdiction. The wife of a Sovereign must be afforded
the same protection and exemption.</p>
<p>(3) He must be granted so-called exterritoriality
conformably with the principle: "<i>Par in parem non
habet imperium</i>," according to which one Sovereign
cannot have any power over another Sovereign. He
must, therefore, in every point be exempt from taxation,
rating, and every fiscal regulation, and likewise
from civil jurisdiction, except when he himself is the
plaintiff.<a id="FNanchor_704_704"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_704_704">[704]</a> The house where he has taken his residence
must enjoy the same exterritoriality as the official residence
of an ambassador; no policeman or other official
must be allowed to enter it without his permission.
Even if a criminal takes refuge in such residence, the
police must be prevented from entering it, although,
if the criminal's surrender is deliberately refused, the
Government may request the recalcitrant Sovereign to
leave the country and then arrest the criminal. If a
foreign Sovereign has real property in a country, such
property is under the latter's jurisdiction. But as soon
as such Sovereign takes his residence on the property,
it must become exterritorial for the time being. Further,
a Sovereign staying in a foreign country must be allowed
to perform all his own governmental acts and functions,
except when his country is at war with a third State
and the State in which he is staying remains neutral.
And, lastly, a Sovereign must be allowed, within the
same limits as at home, to exercise civil jurisdiction over
the members of his retinue. In former times even
criminal jurisdiction over the members of his suite was
very often claimed and conceded, but this is now antiquated.<a id="FNanchor_705_705"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_705_705">[705]</a>
The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span> wife of a Sovereign must likewise be
granted exterritoriality, but not other members of a
Sovereign's family.<a id="FNanchor_706_706"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_706_706">[706]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_705_705"></a><a href="#FNanchor_705_705" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[705]</span></a> A celebrated case happened on November 10, 1656, in France,

 Rivier, I. p. 421, and Bluntschli, § 154; but,
according to Bluntschli, exterritoriality need not in strict law be
granted even to the wife of a Sovereign.</p></div>
<p>However, exterritoriality is in the case of a foreign
Sovereign, as in any other case, a fiction only, which
is kept up for certain purposes within certain limits.
Should a Sovereign during his stay within a foreign
State abuse his privileges, such State is not obliged to
bear such abuse tacitly and quietly, but can request
him to leave the country. And when a foreign Sovereign
commits acts of violence or such acts as endanger
the internal or external safety of the State, the latter
can put him under restraint to prevent further acts of
the same kind, but must at the same time bring him as
speedily as possible to the frontier.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>The Retinue of Monarchs abroad.</p></div>
<p>§ 349. The position of individuals who accompany
a monarch during his stay abroad is a matter of some
dispute. Several publicists maintain that the home
State can claim the privilege of exterritoriality as well
for members of his suite as for the Sovereign himself,
but others deny this.<a id="FNanchor_707_707"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_707_707">[707]</a> I believe that the opinion
of the former is correct, since I cannot see any reason
why a Sovereign abroad should as regards the members
of his suite be in an inferior position to a diplomatic
envoy.<a id="FNanchor_708_708"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_708_708">[708]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Monarchs travelling <i>incognito</i>.</p></div>
<p>§ 350. Hitherto only the case where a monarch is
staying in a foreign country with the official knowledge
of the latter's Government has been discussed. Such
knowledge may be held in the case of a monarch travelling
<i>incognito</i>, and he enjoys then the same privileges as
if travelling not <i>incognito</i>. The only difference is that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
many ceremonial observances, which are due to a monarch,
are not rendered to him when travelling <i>incognito</i>.
But the case may happen that a monarch is travelling
in a foreign country <i>incognito</i> without the latter's
Government having the slightest knowledge thereof.
Such monarch cannot then of course be treated otherwise
than as any other foreign individual; but he can
at any time make known his real character and assume
the privileges due to him. Thus the late King William
of Holland, when travelling <i>incognito</i> in Switzerland in
1873, was condemned to a fine for some slight contravention,
but the sentence was not carried out, as he
gave up his <i>incognito</i>.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Deposed and Abdicated Monarchs.</p></div>
<p>§ 351. All privileges mentioned must be granted to
a monarch only as long as he is really the head of a
State. As soon as he is deposed or has abdicated, he
is no longer a Sovereign. Therefore in 1870 and 1872
the French Courts permitted, because she was deposed,
a civil action against Queen Isabella of Spain,
then living in Paris, for money due to the plaintiffs.
Nothing, of course, prevents the Municipal Law of
a State from granting the same privileges to a
foreign deposed or abdicated monarch as to a foreign
Sovereign, but the Law of Nations does not exact any
such courtesy.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Regents.</p></div>
<p>§ 352. All privileges due to a monarch are also due
to a Regent, at home or abroad, whilst he governs on
behalf of an infant, or of a King who is through illness
incapable of exercising his powers. And it matters not
whether such Regent is a member of the King's family
and a Prince of royal blood or not.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Monarchs in the service or subjects of Foreign Powers.</p></div>
<p>§ 353. When a monarch accepts any office in a foreign
State, when, for instance, he serves in a foreign army,
as the monarchs of the small German States have formerly
frequently done, he submits to such State as far
as the duties of the office are concerned, and his home<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>
State cannot claim any privileges for him that otherwise
would be due to him.</p>
<p>When a monarch is at the same time a subject of
another State, distinction must be made between his
acts as a Sovereign, on the one hand, and his acts as a
subject, on the other. For the latter, the State whose
subject he is has jurisdiction over him, but not for the
former. Thus, in 1837, the Duke of Cumberland became
King of Hanover, but at the same time he was by
hereditary title an English Peer and therefore an English
subject. And in 1844, in the case <i>Duke of Brunswick</i> v.
<i>King of Hanover</i>,<a id="FNanchor_709_709"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_709_709">[709]</a> the Master of the Rolls held that the
King of Hanover was liable to be sued in the Courts of
England in respect of any acts done by him as an English
subject.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Presidents not Sovereigns.</p></div>
<p>§ 354. In contradistinction to monarchies, in republics
the people itself, and not a single individual,
appears as the representative of the sovereignty of the
State, and accordingly the people styles itself the
Sovereign of the State. And it will be remembered
that the head of a republic may consist of a body of
individuals, such as the Bundesrath in Switzerland.
But in case the head is a President, as in France and
the United States of America, such President represents
the State, at least in the totality of its international
relations. He is, however, not a Sovereign,
but a citizen and subject of the very State whose head
he is as President.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Position of Presidents in general.</p></div>
<p>§ 355. Consequently, his position at home and abroad
cannot be compared with that of monarchs, and International
Law does not empower his home State to
claim for him the same, but only similar, consideration
as that due to a monarch. Neither at home nor abroad,
therefore, does a president of a republic appear as a peer
of monarchs. Whereas all monarchs are in the style
of the Court phraseology considered as though they
were members of the same family, and therefore address
each other in letters as "my brother," a president of
a republic is usually addressed in letters from monarchs
as "my friend." His home State can certainly at home
and abroad claim such honours for him as are due to
its dignity, but no such honours as must be granted to
a Sovereign monarch.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Position of Presidents abroad.</p></div>
<p>§ 356. <a id="As_to_the_position_of356"></a>As to the position of a president when abroad,
writers on the Law of Nations do not agree. Some<a id="FNanchor_710_710"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_710_710">[710]</a>
maintain that, since a president is not a Sovereign, his
home State can never claim for him the same privileges
as for a monarch, and especially that of exterritoriality.
Others<a id="FNanchor_711_711"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_711_711">[711]</a> make a distinction whether a president is
staying abroad in his official capacity as head of a
State or for his private purposes, and they maintain
that his home State could only in the first case claim
exterritoriality for him. Others<a id="FNanchor_712_712"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_712_712">[712]</a> again will not admit
any difference in the position of a president abroad
from that of a monarch abroad. How the States themselves
think as regards the question of the exterritoriality
of presidents of republics abroad cannot be ascertained,
since to my knowledge no case has hitherto
occurred in practice from which a conclusion may be
drawn. But practice seems to have settled the question
of ceremonial honours due to a president officially<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
abroad; they are such as correspond to the rank of his
home State, and not such as are due to a monarch.
As regards exterritoriality, I believe that future contingencies
will create the practice on the part of the States
of granting this privilege to presidents and members
of their suite as in the case of monarchs. I cannot
see that there is any danger in such a grant. And nobody
can deny that, if exterritoriality is not granted,
all kinds of friction and even conflicts might arise.
Although not Sovereigns, presidents of republics fill for
the time being a sublime office, and the grant of exterritoriality
to them is a tribute paid to the dignity of
the States they represent.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Position of the Secretary for Foreign Affairs.</p></div>
<p>§ 357. As a rule nowadays no head of a State, be
he a monarch or a president, negotiates directly and in
person with a foreign Power, although this happens
occasionally. The necessary negotiations are regularly
conducted by the Foreign Office, an office which
since the Westphalian Peace has been in existence in
every civilised State. The chief of this office, the
Secretary for Foreign Affairs, who is a Cabinet Minister,
directs the foreign affairs of the State in the name of
the head and with the latter's consent; he is the middle-man
between the head of the State and other States.
And although many a head of a State directs in fact all
the foreign affairs himself, the Secretary for Foreign
Affairs is nevertheless the person through whose hands
all transactions must pass. Now, as regards the position
of such Foreign Secretary at home, it is the Municipal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
Law of a State which regulates this. International
Law defines his position regarding international intercourse
with other States. He is the chief over all the
ambassadors of the State, over its consuls, and over
its other agents in matters international. It is he who,
either in person or through the envoys of his State,
approaches foreign States for the purpose of negotiating
matters international. And again it is he whom foreign
States through their Foreign Secretaries or their envoys
approach for the like purpose. He is present when
Ministers hand in their credentials to the head of the
State. All documents of importance regarding foreign
matters are signed by him or his substitute, the Under-Secretary
for Foreign Affairs. It is, therefore, usual
to notify the appointment of a new Foreign Secretary
of a State to such foreign States as are represented
within its boundaries by diplomatic envoys; the new
Foreign Secretary himself makes this notification.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Development of Legations.</p></div>
<p>§ 358. Legation as an institution for the purpose of
negotiating between different States is as old as history,
whose records are full of examples of legations sent
and received by the oldest nations. And it is remarkable
that even in antiquity, where no such law as the
modern International Law was known, ambassadors
enjoyed everywhere a special protection and certain
privileges, although not by law but by religion, ambassadors
being looked upon as sacrosanct. Yet permanent
legations were unknown till very late in the
Middle Ages. The fact that the Popes had permanent
representatives—so-called <i>apocrisiarii</i> or <i>responsales</i>—at
the Court of the Frankish Kings and at Constantinople
until the final separation of the Eastern from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
Western Church, ought not to be considered as the
first example of permanent legations, as the task of
these papal representatives had nothing to do with
international affairs, but with those of the Church
only. It was not until the thirteenth century that the
first permanent legations made their appearance. The
Italian Republics, and Venice in especial, created the
example<a id="FNanchor_713_713"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_713_713">[713]</a> by keeping representatives stationed at one
another's capitals for the better negotiation of their
international affairs. And in the fifteenth century
these Republics began to keep permanent representatives
in Spain, Germany, France, and England. Other
States followed the example. Special treaties were often
concluded stipulating permanent legations, such as in
1520, for instance, between the King of England and
the Emperor of Germany. From the end of the fifteenth
century England, France, Spain, and Germany kept up
permanent legations at one another's Courts. But it
was not until the second half of the seventeenth century
that permanent legations became a general institution,
the Powers following the example of France under
Louis XIV. and Richelieu. It ought to be specially
mentioned that Grotius<a id="FNanchor_714_714"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_714_714">[714]</a> thought permanent legations
to be wholly unnecessary. The course of events has,
however, shown that Grotius's views as regards permanent
legations were short-sighted. Nowadays the
Family of Nations could not exist without them, as
they are the channel through which nearly the whole,
and certainly all important, official intercourse of the
States flows.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Diplomacy.</p></div>
<p>§ 359. <a id="The_rise_of_permanent359"></a>The rise of permanent legations created the
necessity for a new class of State officials, the so-called
diplomatists; yet it was not until the end of the eighteenth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
century that the terms "diplomatist" and
"diplomacy" came into general use. And although
the art of diplomacy is as old as official intercourse
between States, such a special class of officials as are
now called diplomatists did not and could not exist
until permanent legations had become a general institution.
In this as in other cases the office has created
the class of men necessary for it. International Law
has nothing to do with the education and general character
of these officials. Every State is naturally competent
to create its own rules, if any, as regards these
points. Nor has International Law anything to do
with <i>diplomatic usages</i>, although these are more or less
of importance, as they may occasionally grow into
customary rules of International Law. But I would
notice one of these usages—namely, that as regards the
<i>language</i> which is in use in diplomatic intercourse.
This language was formerly Latin, but through the
political ascendency of France under Louis XIV. it became
French. However, this is a usage of diplomacy
only, and not a rule of International Law.<a id="FNanchor_715_715"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_715_715">[715]</a> Each State
can use its own language in all official communications
to other States, and States which have the same language
regularly do so in their intercourse with each
other. But between States of different tongues and,
further, at Conferences and Congresses, it is convenient
to make use of a language which is generally known.
This is nowadays French, but nothing could prevent
diplomatists from dropping French at any moment and
adopting another language instead.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Conception of Right of Legation.</p></div>
<p>§ 360. <a id="Right_of_legation360"></a>Right of legation is the right of a State to
send and receive diplomatic envoys. The right to send
such envoys is termed <i>active</i> right of legation, in contradistinction
to the <i>passive</i> right of legation, as the right
to receive such envoys is termed. Some writers<a id="FNanchor_716_716"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_716_716">[716]</a> on
International Law assert that no right but a mere
competence to send and receive diplomatic envoys
exists according to International Law, maintaining that
no State is bound by International Law to send or
receive such envoys. But this is certainly wrong in its
generality. Obviously a State is not bound to send
diplomatic envoys or to receive <i>permanent</i> envoys.
But, on the other hand, the very existence<a id="FNanchor_717_717"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_717_717">[717]</a> of the
Family of Nations makes it necessary for the members
or some of the members to negotiate occasionally on
certain points. Such negotiation would be impossible
in case one member could always and under all circumstances
refuse to receive an envoy from the other
members. The duty of every member to listen, under
ordinary circumstances, to a message from another
brought by a diplomatic envoy is, therefore, an outcome
of its very membership of the Family of Nations,
and this duty corresponds to the right of every member
to send such envoys. But the exercise of the active
right of legation is discretionary. No State need send
diplomatic envoys at all, although practically all States<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>
do at least occasionally send such envoys, and most
States send permanent envoys to many other States.
The passive right of legation is discretionary as regards
the reception of <i>permanent</i> envoys only.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_716_716"></a><a href="#FNanchor_716_716" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[716]</span></a> See,
 for instance, Wheaton, § 207; Heilborn, "System," p.
182.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What States possess the Right of Legation.</p></div>
<p>§ 361. Not every State, however, possesses the right
of legation. Such right pertains chiefly to full-Sovereign
States,<a id="FNanchor_718_718"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_718_718">[718]</a> for other States possess this right under
certain conditions only.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_718_718"></a><a href="#FNanchor_718_718" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[718]</span></a> It should be emphasised that
 the Holy See, which is in some
respects treated as though an International Person, can send and receive
envoys, who must in every respect be considered as though they were
diplomatic envoys. That they are actually not diplomatic envoys,
although so treated, becomes apparent from the fact that they are not
agents for international affairs of States, but exclusively for affairs
of the Roman Catholic Church. (See
 above, § <a href="#The_Law_of_Guaranty106" class="pginternal">106</a>.)</p></div>
<p>(1) Half-Sovereign States, such as States under the
suzerainty or the protectorate of another State, can as
a rule neither send nor receive diplomatic envoys.
Thus, Crete and Egypt are destitute of such right,
and the Powers are represented in these States only by
consuls or agents without diplomatic character. But
there may be exceptions to this rule. Thus, according
to the Peace Treaty of Kainardgi of 1774 between
Russia and Turkey, the two half-Sovereign principalities
of Moldavia and Wallachia had the right of sending
Chargés d'Affaires to foreign Powers. Thus, further,
the late South African Republic, which was a State
under British suzerainty in the opinion of Great Britain,
used to keep permanent diplomatic envoys in several
foreign States.</p>
<p>(2) Part-Sovereign member-States of a Federal State
may or may not have the right of legation besides the
Federal State. It is the constitution of the Federal
State which regulates this point. Thus, the member-States
of Switzerland and of the United States of
America have no right of legation, but those of the
German Empire certainly have. Bavaria, for example,
sends and receives several diplomatic envoys. <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Right of Legation by whom exercised.</p></div>
<p>§ 362. As, according to International Law, a State
is represented in its international relations by its head,
it is he who acts in the exercise of his State's right of
legation. But Municipal Law may, just as it designates
the person who is the head of the State, impose
certain conditions and restrictions upon the head as
regards the exercise of such right. And the head himself
may, provided that it is sanctioned by the Municipal
Law of his State, delegate<a id="FNanchor_719_719"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_719_719">[719]</a> the exercise of such
right to any representative he chooses.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_719_719"></a><a href="#FNanchor_719_719" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[719]</span></a> See
 Phillimore, II. §§ 126-133, where several interesting
cases of such delegation are discussed.</p></div>
<p>It may, however, in consequence of revolutionary
movements, be doubtful who the real head of a State is,
and in such cases it remains in the discretion of foreign
States to make their choice. But it is impossible for
foreign States to receive diplomatic envoys from both
claimants to the headship of the same State, or to send
diplomatic envoys to both of them. And as soon as
a State has recognised the head of a State who came into
his position through a revolution, it can no longer keep
up diplomatic relations with the former head.</p>
<p>It should be mentioned that a revolutionary party
which is recognised as a belligerent Power has nevertheless
no right of legation, although foreign States
may negotiate with such party in an informal way
through political agents without diplomatic character,
to provide for the temporal security of the persons and
property of their subjects within the territory under
the actual sway of such party. Such revolutionary
party as is recognised as a belligerent Power is in some
points only treated as though it were a subject of
International Law; but it is not a State, and there is
no reason why International Law should give it the
right to send and receive diplomatic envoys.</p>
<p>It should further be mentioned that neither an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
abdicated nor a deposed head has a right to send and
receive diplomatic envoys.<a id="FNanchor_720_720"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_720_720">[720]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Envoys Ceremonial and Political.</p></div>
<p>§ 363. Two different kinds of diplomatic envoys are
to be distinguished—namely, such as are sent for political
negotiations and such as are sent for the purpose
of ceremonial function or notification of changes in the
headship. For States very often send special envoys
to one another on occasion of coronations, weddings,
funerals, jubilees, and the like; and it is also usual to
send envoys to announce a fresh accession to the throne.
Such envoys ceremonial have the same standing as envoys
political for real State negotiations. Among the envoys
political, again, two kinds are to be distinguished—namely,
first, such as are permanently or temporarily
accredited to a State for the purpose of negotiating with
such State, and, second, such as are sent to represent
the sending State at a Congress or Conference. The latter
are not, or need not be, accredited to the State on
whose territory the Congress or Conference takes place,
but they are nevertheless diplomatic envoys and enjoy
all the privileges of such envoys as regards exterritoriality
and the like which concern the inviolability and
safety of their persons and the members of their suites.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Classes of Diplomatic Envoys.</p></div>
<p>§ 364. Diplomatic envoys accredited to a State differ
in class. These classes did not exist in the early stages
of International Law. But during the sixteenth century<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>
a distinction between two classes of diplomatic
envoys gradually arose, and at about the middle of the
seventeenth century, after permanent legations had
come into general vogue, two such classes became generally
recognised—namely, extraordinary envoys, called
Ambassadors, and ordinary envoys, called Residents;
Ambassadors being received with higher honours and
taking precedence of the other envoys. Disputes arose
frequently regarding precedence, and the States tried
in vain to avoid them by introducing during the eighteenth
century another class—namely, the so-called
Ministers Plenipotentiary. At last the Powers assembled
at the Vienna Congress came to the conclusion that the
matter ought to be settled by an international understanding,
and they agreed, therefore, on March 19,
1815, upon the establishment of three different classes—namely,
first, Ambassadors; second, Ministers Plenipotentiary
and Envoys Extraordinary; third, Chargés
d'Affaires. And the five Powers assembled at the
Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1818 agreed upon a
fourth class—namely, Ministers Resident, to rank between
Ministers Plenipotentiary and Chargés d'Affaires.
All the other States either expressly or tacitly accepted
these arrangements, so that nowadays the four classes
are an established order. Although their privileges are
materially the same, they differ in rank and honours,
and they must therefore be treated separately.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Ambassadors.</p></div>
<p>§ 365. <a id="Ambassadors_form_the_first365"></a>Ambassadors form the first class. Only
States enjoying royal honours<a id="FNanchor_721_721"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_721_721">[721]</a> are entitled to send and
to receive Ambassadors, as also is the Holy See, whose
first-class envoys are called <i>Nuncios</i>, or <i>Legati a latere</i>
or <i>de latere</i>. Ambassadors are considered to be personal
representatives of the heads of their States and enjoy
for this reason special honours. Their chief privilege—namely,
that of negotiating with the head of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>
State personally—has, however, little value nowadays,
as almost all States have to a certain extent constitutional
government, which necessitates that all the
important business should go through the hands of a
Foreign Secretary.</p>

the Papal Internuncios, are not considered to be personal
representatives of the heads of their States.
Therefore they do not enjoy all the special honours of
the Ambassadors, and have not the privilege of treating
with the head of the State personally. But otherwise
there is no difference between these two classes.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Ministers Resident.</p></div>
<p>§ 367. The third class, the Ministers Resident, enjoy
fewer honours and rank below the Ministers Plenipotentiary.
But beyond the fact that Ministers Resident
do not enjoy the title "Excellency," there is no
difference between them and the Ministers Plenipotentiary.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Chargés d'Affaires.</p></div>
<p>§ 368. The fourth class, the Chargés d'Affaires,
differs chiefly in one point from the first, second, and
third class—namely, in so far as its members are accredited
from Foreign Office to Foreign Office, whereas
the members of the other classes are accredited from
head of State to head of State. Chargés d'Affaires
do not enjoy, therefore, so many honours as other
diplomatic envoys. And it must be specially mentioned
that a distinction ought to be made between a Chargé
d'Affaires who is the head of a Legation, and who,
therefore, is accredited from Foreign Office to Foreign
Office, and a Chargé d'Affaires <i>ad interim</i>. The latter
is a member of a Legation whom the head of the Legation
delegates for the purpose of taking his place during
absence on leave. Such Chargé d'Affaires <i>ad interim</i>,
who had better be called a Chargé des Affaires,<a id="FNanchor_722_722"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_722_722">[722]</a> ranks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>
below the ordinary Chargé d'Affaires; he is not accredited
from Foreign Office to Foreign Office, but is
simply a delegate of the absent head of the Legation.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>The Diplomatic Corps.</p></div>
<p>§ 369. All the Diplomatic Envoys accredited to the
same State form, according to a diplomatic usage, a
body which is styled the "Diplomatic Corps." The
head of this body, the so-called "Doyen," is the Papal
Nuncio, or, in case there is no Nuncio accredited, the
oldest Ambassador, or, failing Ambassadors, the oldest
Minister Plenipotentiary, and so on. As the Diplomatic
Corps is not a body legally constituted, it performs
no legal functions, but it is nevertheless of great
importance, as it watches over the privileges and
honours due to diplomatic envoys.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Person and Qualification of the Envoy.</p></div>
<p>§ 370. International Law has no rules as regards the
qualification of the individuals whom a State can
appoint as diplomatic envoys, States being naturally
competent to act according to discretion, although
of course there are many qualifications a diplomatic
envoy must possess to fill his office successfully. The
Municipal Laws of many States comprise, therefore,
many details as regards the knowledge and training
which a candidate for a permanent diplomatic post
must possess, whereas, regarding envoys ceremonial
even the Municipal Laws have no provisions at all.
The question is sometimes discussed whether females<a id="FNanchor_723_723"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_723_723">[723]</a>
might<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span> be appointed envoys. History relates a few
cases of female diplomatists. Thus, for example, Louis
XIV. of France accredited in 1646 Madame de Guébriant
ambassador to the Court of Poland. During the
last two centuries, however, no such case has to my
knowledge occurred, although I doubt not that International
Law does not prevent a State from sending
a female as diplomatic envoy. But under the present
circumstances many States would refuse to receive her.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_723_723"></a><a href="#FNanchor_723_723" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[723]</span></a> See

(1909).</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Letter of Credence, Full Powers, Passports.</p></div>
<p>§ 371. The appointment of an individual as a diplomatic
envoy is announced to the State to which he is
accredited in certain official papers to be handed in by
the envoy to the receiving State. <i>Letter of Credence</i>
(<i>lettre de créance</i>) is the designation of the document
in which the head of the State accredits a permanent
ambassador or minister to a foreign State. Every such
envoy receives a sealed Letter of Credence and an
open copy. As soon as the envoy arrives at his destination,
he sends the copy to the Foreign Office in
order to make his arrival officially known. The sealed
original, however, is handed in personally by the envoy
to the head of the State to whom he is accredited.
Chargés d'Affaires receive a Letter of Credence too, but
as they are accredited from Foreign Office to Foreign
Office, their Letter of Credence is signed, not by the
head of their home State, but by its Foreign Office.
Now a permanent diplomatic envoy needs no other
empowering document in case he is not entrusted with
any task outside the limits of the ordinary business of
a permanent legation. But in case he is entrusted
with any such task, as, for instance, if any special
treaty or convention is to be negotiated, he requires a
special empowering document—namely, the so-called
<i>Full Powers</i> (<i>Pleins Pouvoirs</i>). They are given in
Letters Patent signed by the head of the State, and
they are either limited or unlimited Full Powers, according
to the requirements of the case. Such diplomatic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>
envoys as are sent, not to represent their home State
permanently, but on an extraordinary mission such as
representation at a Congress, negotiation of a special
treaty, and other transactions, receive full Powers
only, and no Letter of Credence. Every permanent or
other diplomatic envoy is also furnished with so-called
<i>Instructions</i> for the guidance of his conduct as regards
the objects of his mission. But such Instructions are
a matter between the Envoy and his home State exclusively,
and they have therefore, although they may
otherwise be very important, no importance for International
Law. Every permanent diplomatic envoy
receives, lastly, <i>Passports</i> for himself and his suite
specially made out by the Foreign Office. These Passports
the envoy after his arrival deposits at the Foreign
Office of the State to which he is accredited, where they
remain until he himself asks for them because he desires
to leave his post, or until they are returned to him on
his dismissal.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Combined Legations.</p></div>
<p>§ 372. As a rule, a State appoints different individuals
as permanent diplomatic envoys to different
States, but sometimes a State appoints the same individual
as permanent diplomatic envoy to several States.
As a rule, further, a diplomatic envoy represents one
State only. But occasionally several States appoint
the same individual as their envoy, so that one envoy
represents several States.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Appointment of several Envoys.</p></div>
<p>§ 373. In former times States used frequently<a id="FNanchor_724_724"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_724_724">[724]</a> to
appoint more than one permanent diplomatic envoy as
their representative in a foreign State. Although this
would hardly occur nowadays, there is no rule against
such a possibility. And even now it happens frequently
that States appoint several envoys for the purpose of
representing them at Congresses and Conferences. In
such cases one of the several envoys is appointed senior,
to whom the others are subordinate.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Duty to receive Diplomatic Envoys.</p></div>
<p>§ 374. Every member of the Family of Nations that
possesses the passive right of legation is under ordinary
circumstances bound to receive diplomatic envoys
accredited to itself from other States for the purpose
of negotiation. But the duty extends neither to the
reception of permanent envoys nor to the reception of
temporary envoys under all circumstances.</p>
<p>(1) As regards permanent envoys, it is a generally
recognised fact that a State is as little bound to receive
them as it is to send them. Practically, however, every
full-Sovereign State which desires its voice to be heard
among the States receives and sends permanent envoys,
as without such it would, under present circumstances,
be impossible for a State to have any influence whatever
in international affairs. It is for this reason that
Switzerland, which in former times abstained entirely
from sending permanent envoys, has abandoned her
former practice and nowadays sends and receives
several. The insignificant Principality of Lichtenstein
is, as far as I know, the only full-Sovereign State which
neither sends nor receives one single permanent legation.</p>
<p>But a State may receive a permanent legation from
one State and refuse to do so from another. Thus
the Protestant States never <i>received</i> a permanent legation
from the Popes, even when the latter were heads
of a State, and they still observe this rule, although one
or another of them, such as Prussia for example, keeps
a permanent legation at the Vatican.</p>
<p>(2) As regards temporary envoys, it is likewise a
generally recognised fact among those writers who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
assert the duty of a State to receive under ordinary
circumstances temporary envoys that there are exceptions
to that rule. Thus, for example, a State which
knows beforehand the object of a mission and does not
wish to negotiate thereon can refuse to receive the
mission. Thus, further, a belligerent can refuse<a id="FNanchor_725_725"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_725_725">[725]</a> to
receive a legation from the other belligerent, as war
involves the rupture of all peaceable relations.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_725_725"></a><a href="#FNanchor_725_725" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[725]</span></a> But this is not generally recognised.
See Vattel, IV. § 67; Phillimore,
II. § 138; and Pradier-Fodéré,
III. No. 1255.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Refusal to receive a certain Individual.</p></div>
<p>§ 375. But the refusal to receive an envoy must not
be confounded with the refusal to receive a certain
individual as envoy. A State may be ready to receive
a permanent or temporary envoy, but may object to
the individual selected for that purpose. International
Law gives no right to a State to insist upon the reception
of an individual appointed by it as diplomatic
envoy. Every State can refuse to receive as envoy a
person objectionable to itself. And a State refusing
an individual envoy is neither compelled to specify what
kind of objection it has, nor to justify its objection.
Thus, for example, most States refuse to receive one of
their own subjects as an envoy from a foreign State.<a id="FNanchor_726_726"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_726_726">[726]</a>
Thus, again, the King of Hanover refused in 1847 to
receive a minister appointed by Prussia, because the
individual was of the Roman Catholic faith. Italy
refused in 1885 to receive Mr. Keiley as ambassador of
the United States of America because he had in 1871
protested against the annexation of the Papal States.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>
And when the United States sent the same gentleman
as ambassador to Austria, the latter refused him reception
on the ground that his wife was said to be a Jewess.
Although, as is apparent from these examples, no State
has a right to insist upon the reception of a certain
individual as envoy, in practice States are often offended
when reception is refused. Thus, in 1832 England did
not cancel for three years the appointment of Sir Stratford
Canning as ambassador to Russia, although the
latter refused reception, and the post was practically
vacant. In 1885, when, as above mentioned, Austria
refused reception to Mr. Keiley as ambassador of the
United States, the latter did not appoint another, although
Mr. Keiley resigned, and the legation was for
several years left to the care of a Chargé d'Affaires.<a id="FNanchor_727_727"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_727_727">[727]</a>
To avoid such conflicts it is a good practice of many
States never to appoint an individual as envoy without
having ascertained beforehand whether the individual
would be <i>persona grata</i>. And it is a customary rule of
International Law that a State which does not object
to the appointment of a certain individual, when its
opinion has been asked beforehand, is bound to receive
such individual.<a id="FNanchor_728_728"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_728_728">[728]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_726_726"></a><a href="#FNanchor_726_726" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[726]</span></a> In case a State receives one of its own subjects as
diplomatic envoy of a foreign State, it has to grant him all the
privileges of such envoys, including exterritoriality. Thus in the case
of Macartney <i>v.</i> Garbutt and others (1890, L.R. 24 Q.B. 368) it was
decided that a British subject accredited to Great Britain by the
Chinese Government as a Secretary of its embassy and received by Great
Britain in that capacity without an express condition that he should
remain subject to British jurisdiction, was exempt from British
jurisdiction. See, however, article 15 of the Règlement sur les
Immunités Diplomatiques, adopted in 1895 by the Institute of
International Law (see Annuaire, XIV. p. 244), which denies to such an
individual exemption from jurisdiction. See also Phillimore, II. § 135,
and Twiss, I. § 203.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_727_727"></a><a href="#FNanchor_727_727" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[727]</span></a> See
 Moore, IV. § 638, p. 480.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_728_728"></a><a href="#FNanchor_728_728" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[728]</span></a> The question is of interest whether the privileges due to
diplomatists must be granted on his journey home to an individual to
whom reception as an envoy is refused. I think the question ought to be
answered in the affirmative; see, however, Moore, IV. § 666, p. 668.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Mode and Solemnity of Reception.</p></div>
<p>§ 376. In case a State does not object to the reception
of a person as diplomatic envoy accredited to
itself, his actual reception takes place as soon as he
has arrived at the place of his designation. But the
mode of reception differs according to the class to which
the envoy belongs. If he be one of the first, second,
or third class, it is the duty of the head of the State
to receive him solemnly in a so-called public audience
with all the usual ceremonies. For that purpose the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>
envoy sends a copy of his credentials to the Foreign
Office, which arranges a special audience with the head
of the State for the envoy, when he delivers in person
his sealed credentials.<a id="FNanchor_729_729"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_729_729">[729]</a> If the envoy be a Chargé
d'Affaires only, he is received in audience by the Secretary
of Foreign Affairs, to whom he hands his credentials.
Through the formal reception the envoy becomes
officially recognised and can officially commence to
exercise his functions. But such of his privileges as
exterritoriality and the like, which concern the safety
and inviolability of his person, must be granted even
before his official reception, as his character as diplomatic
envoy is considered to date, not from the time
of his official reception, but from the time when his
credentials were handed to him on leaving his home
State, his passports furnishing sufficient proof of his
diplomatic character.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_729_729"></a><a href="#FNanchor_729_729" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[729]</span></a> Details concerning reception of envoys are given by Twiss,
I. § 215, and Rivier, I. p. 467.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Reception of Envoys to Congresses and Conferences.</p></div>
<p>§ 377. It must be specially observed that all these
details regarding the reception of diplomatic envoys
accredited to a State do not apply to the reception of
envoys sent to represent the several States at a Congress
or Conference. As such envoys are not accredited to
the State on whose territory the Congress or Conference
takes place, such State has no competence to refuse the
reception of the appointed envoys, and no formal and
official reception of the latter by the head of the State
need take place. The appointing States merely notify
the appointment of their envoys to the Foreign Office of
the State on whose territory the transactions take place,
the envoys call upon the Foreign Secretary after their
arrival to introduce themselves, and they are courteously
received by him. They do not, however, hand
in to him their Full Powers, but reserve them for the
first meeting of the Congress or Conference, where they
produce them in exchange with one another.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span></p>
<h4>

§§ 1346-1376.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>On Diplomatic Functions in general.</p></div>
<p>§ 378. A distinction must be made between functions
of permanent envoys and of envoys for temporary
purposes. The functions of the latter, who are either
envoys ceremonial or such envoys political as are
only temporarily accredited for the purpose of some
definite negotiations or as representatives at Congresses
and Conferences, are clearly demonstrated by the
very purpose of their appointment. But the functions
of the permanent envoys demand a closer consideration.
These regular functions may be grouped together
under the heads of negotiation, observation, and protection.
But besides these regular functions a diplomatic
envoy may be charged with other and more miscellaneous
functions.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Negotiation.</p></div>
<p>§ 379. A permanent ambassador or other envoy
represents his home State in the totality of its international
relations not only with the State to which he
is accredited, but also with other States. He is the
mouthpiece of the head of his home State and its
Foreign Secretary as regards communications to be
made to the State to which he is accredited. He likewise
receives communications from the latter and
reports them to his home State. In this way not only
are international relations between these two States
fostered and negotiated upon, but such international
affairs of other States as are of general interest to all
or a part of the members of the Family of Nations are
also discussed. Owing to the fact that all the more
important Powers keep permanent legations accredited
to one another, a constant exchange of views in regard
to affairs international is taking place between them.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Observation.</p></div>
<p>§ 380. But these are not all the functions of permanent
diplomatic envoys. Their task is, further, to
observe attentively every occurrence which might affect
the interest of their home States, and to report such
observations to their Governments. It is through
these reports that every member of the Family of
Nations is kept well informed in regard to the army
and navy, the finances, the public opinion, the commerce
and industry of foreign countries. And it must
be specially observed that no State that receives
diplomatic envoys has a right to prevent them from
exercising their function of observation.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Protection.</p></div>
<p>§ 381. A third task of diplomatic envoys is the
protection of the persons, property, and interests of
such subjects of their home States as are within the
boundaries of the State to which they are accredited.
If such subjects are wronged without being able to find
redress in the ordinary way of justice, and ask the
help of the diplomatic envoy of their home State, he
must be allowed to afford them protection. It is, however,
for the Municipal Law and regulations of his home
State, and not for International Law, to prescribe to an
envoy the limits within which he has to afford protection
to his compatriots.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Miscellaneous Functions.</p></div>
<p>§ 382. Negotiation, observation, and protection are
tasks common to all diplomatic envoys of every State.
But a State may order its permanent envoys to perform
other tasks, such as the registration of deaths, births,
and marriages of subjects of the home State, legalisation
of their signatures, making out of passports for them,
and the like. But in doing this a State must be careful
not to order its envoys to perform such tasks as are by
the law of the receiving State exclusively reserved to
its own officials. Thus, for instance, a State whose
laws compel persons who intend marriage to conclude
it in presence of its registrars, need not allow a foreign<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>
envoy to legalise a marriage of compatriots before its
registration by the official registrar. So, too, a State
need not allow a foreign envoy to perform an act which
is reserved for its jurisdiction, as, for instance, the examination
of witnesses on oath.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Envoys not to interfere in Internal Politics.</p></div>
<p>§ 383. But it must be specially emphasised that
envoys must not interfere with the internal political
life of the State to which they are accredited. It certainly
belongs to their functions to watch the political
events and the political parties with a vigilant eye and
to report their observations to their home States. But
they have no right whatever to take part in that political
life itself, to encourage a certain political party,
or to threaten another. If nevertheless they do so,
they abuse their position. And it matters not whether
an envoy acts thus on his own account or on instructions
from his home State. No strong self-respecting
State will allow a foreign envoy to exercise such interference,
but will either request his home State to recall
him and appoint another individual in his place or,
in case his interference is very flagrant, hand him his
passports and therewith dismiss him. History records
many instances of this kind,<a id="FNanchor_730_730"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_730_730">[730]</a> although in many cases
it is doubtful whether the envoy concerned really
abused his office for the purpose of interfering with
internal politics.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_730_730"></a><a href="#FNanchor_730_730" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[730]</span></a> See
 Hall (§ 98**), Taylor (§ 322), and Moore (IV. § 640),
who discuss a number of cases, especially that of Lord Sackville, who
received his passports in 1888 from the United States of America for an
alleged interference in the Presidential election.</p></div>
<h4>
<span class="larger">VII</span>
<span class="smaller">POSITION OF DIPLOMATIC ENVOYS</span>
</h4>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Diplomatic Envoys objects of International Law.</p></div>
<p>§ 384. <a id="Diplomatic_envoys384"></a>Diplomatic envoys are just as little subjects
of International Law as are heads of States; and the
arguments regarding the position of such heads<a id="FNanchor_731_731"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_731_731">[731]</a> must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>
also be applied to the position of diplomatic envoys,
which is given to them by International Law not as
individuals but as representative agents of their States.
It is derived, not from personal rights, but from rights
and duties of their home States and the receiving States.
All the privileges which according to International Law
are possessed by diplomatic envoys are not rights
given to them by International Law, but rights given
by the Municipal Law of the receiving States in compliance
with an international right of their home States.
For International Law gives a right to every State to
demand for its diplomatic envoys certain privileges
from the Municipal Law of a foreign State. Thus, a
diplomatic envoy is not a subject but an object of
International Law, and is in this regard like any other
individual.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Privileges due to Diplomatic Envoys.</p></div>
<p>§ 385. <a id="Privileges_due_to_diplomatic385"></a>Privileges due to diplomatic envoys, apart
from ceremonial honours, have reference to their inviolability
and to their so-called exterritoriality. The
reasons why these privileges must be granted are that
diplomatic envoys are representatives of States and of
their dignity,<a id="FNanchor_732_732"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_732_732">[732]</a> and, further, that they could not exercise
their functions perfectly unless they enjoyed such
privileges. For it is obvious that, were they liable to
ordinary legal and political interference like other
individuals and thus more or less dependent on the
good-will of the Government, they might be influenced
by personal considerations of safety and comfort to
such a degree as would materially hamper the exercise
of their functions. It is equally clear that liability to
interference with their full and free intercourse with
their home States through letters, telegrams, and
couriers would wholly nullify their <i>raison d'être</i>. In
this case it would be impossible for them to send independent
and secret reports to or receive similar instructions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>
from their home States. From the consideration
of these and various cognate reasons their privileges
seem to be inseparable attributes of the very existence
of diplomatic envoys.<a id="FNanchor_733_733"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_733_733">[733]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Protection due to Diplomatic Envoys.</p></div>
<p>§ 386. <a id="Diplomatic_envoys386"></a>Diplomatic envoys are just as sacrosanct as
heads of States. They must, therefore, on the one
hand, be afforded special protection as regards the
safety of their persons, and, on the other hand, they
must be exempted from every kind of criminal jurisdiction
of the receiving States. Now the protection
due to diplomatic envoys must find its expression not
only in the necessary police measures for the prevention
of offences, but also in specially severe punishments
to be inflicted on offenders. Thus, according to
English Criminal Law,<a id="FNanchor_734_734"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_734_734">[734]</a> every one is guilty of a misdemeanour
who, by force or personal restraint, violates
any privilege conferred upon the diplomatic representatives
of foreign countries, or who<a id="FNanchor_735_735"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_735_735">[735]</a> sets forth or prosecutes
or executes any writ or process whereby the
person of any diplomatic representative of a foreign<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span>
country or the person of a servant of any such representative
is arrested or imprisoned. The protection of
diplomatic envoys is not restricted to their own person,
but must be extended to the members of their family
and suite, to their official residence, their furniture,
carriages, papers, and likewise to their intercourse with
their home States by letters, telegrams, and special
messengers. Even after a diplomatic mission has come
to an end, the archives of an Embassy must not be
touched, provided they have been put under seal and
confided to the protection of another envoy.<a id="FNanchor_736_736"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_736_736">[736]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Exemption from Criminal Jurisdiction.</p></div>
<p>§ 387. <a id="As_regards_the387"></a>As regards the exemption of diplomatic
envoys from criminal jurisdiction, theory and practice of
International Law agree nowadays<a id="FNanchor_737_737"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_737_737">[737]</a> upon the fact that
the receiving States have no right, under any circumstances
whatever, to prosecute and punish diplomatic
envoys. But among writers on International Law the
question is not settled whether the commands and injunctions
of the laws of the receiving States concern
diplomatic envoys at all, so that the latter have to
comply with such commands and injunctions, although
the fact is established that they can never be prosecuted
and punished for any breach.<a id="FNanchor_738_738"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_738_738">[738]</a> This question ought
to be decided in the negative, for a diplomatic envoy
must in no point be considered under the legal authority
of the receiving State. But this does not mean that a
diplomatic envoy must have a right to do what he
likes. The presupposition of the privileges he enjoys
is that he acts and behaves in such a manner as harmonises
with the internal order of the receiving State.
He is therefore expected voluntarily to comply with
all such commands and injunctions of the Municipal Law
as do not restrict him in the effective exercise of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>
functions. In case he acts and behaves otherwise, and
disturbs thereby the internal order of the State, the
latter will certainly request his recall or send him back
at once.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_737_737"></a><a href="#FNanchor_737_737" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[737]</span></a> In former times there was no unanimity amongst publicists.
See Phillimore, II. § 154.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_738_738"></a><a href="#FNanchor_738_738" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[738]</span></a> The point is thoroughly discussed by Beling, "Die
strafrechtliche Bedeutung der Exterritorialität" (1896), pp. 71-90.</p></div>
<p>History records many cases of diplomatic envoys
who have conspired against the receiving States, but
have nevertheless not been prosecuted. Thus, in 1584,
the Spanish Ambassador Mendoza in England plotted
to depose Queen Elizabeth; he was ordered to leave
the country. In 1586 the French Ambassador in
England, L'Aubespine, conspired against the life of
Queen Elizabeth; he was simply warned not to commit
a similar act again. In 1654 the French Ambassador
in England, De Bass, conspired against the life of
Cromwell; he was ordered to leave the country within
twenty-four hours.<a id="FNanchor_739_739"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_739_739">[739]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_739_739"></a><a href="#FNanchor_739_739" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[739]</span></a> These and other cases are discussed by Phillimore, II. §§
160-165.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Limitation of Inviolability.</p></div>
<p>§ 388. As diplomatic envoys are sacrosanct, the
principle of their inviolability is generally recognised.
But there is one exception. For if a diplomatic envoy
commits an act of violence which disturbs the internal
order of the receiving State in such a manner as makes
it necessary to put him under restraint for the purpose
of preventing similar acts, or in case he conspires against
the receiving State and the conspiracy can be made
futile only by putting him under restraint, he may be
arrested for the time being, although he must in due time
be safely sent home. Thus in 1717 the Swedish Ambassador
Gyllenburg in London, who was an accomplice
in a plot against King George I., was arrested and
his papers were searched. In 1718 the Spanish Ambassador
Prince Cellamare in France was placed in
custody because he organised a conspiracy against the
French Government.<a id="FNanchor_740_740"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_740_740">[740]</a> And it must be emphasised that
a diplomatic envoy cannot make it a point of complaint<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>
if injured in consequence of his own unjustifiable behaviour,
as for instance in attacking an individual who
in self-defence retaliates, or in unreasonably or wilfully
placing himself in dangerous or awkward positions, such
as in a disorderly crowd.<a id="FNanchor_741_741"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_741_741">[741]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Reason and Fictional Character of Exterritoriality.</p></div>
<p>§ 389. The exterritoriality which must be granted
to diplomatic envoys by the Municipal Laws of all the
members of the Family of Nations is not, as in the
case of sovereign heads of States, based on the principle
<i>par in parem non habet imperium</i>, but on the necessity
that envoys must, for the purpose of fulfilling their
duties, be independent of the jurisdiction, the control,
and the like, of the receiving States. Exterritoriality,
in this as in every other case, is a fiction only, for diplomatic
envoys are in reality not without, but within, the
territories of the receiving States. The term "Exterritoriality"
is nevertheless valuable, because it
demonstrates clearly the fact that envoys must in most
points be treated as though they were not within the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>
territory of the receiving States.<a id="FNanchor_742_742"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_742_742">[742]</a> And the so-called
exterritoriality of envoys is actualised by a body of
privileges which must be severally discussed.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_742_742"></a><a href="#FNanchor_742_742" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[742]</span></a> With a few exceptions (see
 Droin, "L'exterritorialité des
agents diplomatiques" (1895), pp. 32-43), all publicists accept the term
and the fiction of exterritoriality.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Immunity of Domicile.</p></div>
<p>§ 390. <a id="The_first_of_these_privileges390"></a>The first of these privileges is immunity of
domicile, the so-called <i>Franchise de l'hôtel</i>. The present
immunity of domicile has developed from the former
condition of things, when the official residences of envoys
were in every point considered to be outside the territory
of the receiving States, and when this exterritoriality
was in many cases even extended to the whole
quarter of the town in which such a residence was
situated. One used then to speak of a <i>Franchise du
quartier</i> or the <i>Jus quarteriorum</i>. And an inference
from this <i>Franchise du quartier</i> was the so-called right
of asylum, envoys claiming the right to grant asylum
within the boundaries of their residential quarters to
every individual who took refuge there.<a id="FNanchor_743_743"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_743_743">[743]</a> But already
in the seventeenth century most States opposed this
<i>Franchise du quartier</i>, and it totally disappeared in the
eighteenth century, leaving behind, however, the claim
of envoys to grant asylum within their official residences.
Thus, when in 1726 the Duke of Ripperda, first
Minister to Philip V. of Spain, who was accused of high
treason and had taken refuge in the residence of the
English Ambassador in Madrid, was forcibly arrested
there by order of the Spanish Government, the British
Government complained of this act as a violation of
International Law.<a id="FNanchor_744_744"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_744_744">[744]</a> Twenty-one years later, in 1747,
a similar case occurred in Sweden. A merchant named
Springer was accused of high treason and took refuge<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>
in the house of the English Ambassador at Stockholm.
On the refusal of the English envoy to surrender Springer,
the Swedish Government surrounded the embassy with
troops and ordered the carriage of the envoy, when
leaving the embassy, to be followed by mounted soldiers.
At last Springer was handed over to the Swedish
Government under protest, but England complained and
called back her ambassador, as Sweden refused to make
the required reparation.<a id="FNanchor_745_745"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_745_745">[745]</a> As these two examples show,
the right of asylum, although claimed and often conceded,
was nevertheless not universally recognised.
During the nineteenth century all remains of it vanished,
and when in 1867 the French envoy in Lima
claimed it, the Peruvian Government refused to concede
it.<a id="FNanchor_746_746"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_746_746">[746]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_743_743"></a><a href="#FNanchor_743_743" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[743]</span></a> Although this right of asylum was certainly recognised by
the States in former centuries, it is of interest to note that Grotius
did not consider it postulated by International Law, for he says of this
right (II. c. 18, § 8): "Ex concessione pendet ejus apud quem agit.
Istud enim juris gentium non est." See also Bynkershoek, "De foro
legat." c. 21.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_744_744"></a><a href="#FNanchor_744_744" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[744]</span></a> See
 Martens, "Causes Célèbres," I. p. 178.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_746_746"></a><a href="#FNanchor_746_746" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[746]</span></a> The South American States, Chili excepted, still grant the
right to foreign envoys to afford asylum to political refugees in time
of revolution. It is, however, acknowledged that this right is not based
upon a rule of International Law, but merely upon <i>local</i> usage. See
Hall, § 52; Westlake, I. p. 272; Moore, II. §§ 291-304; Chilbert in A.J.
III. (1909), pp. 562-595; Robbin in R.G. XV. (1908), pp. 461-508; Moore,
"Asylum in Legations and Consulates, and in Vessels" (1892). That
actually in times of revolution and of persecution of certain classes of
the population asylum is occasionally granted to refugees and respected
by the local authorities, there is no doubt, but this occasional
practice does not shake the validity of the general rule of
International Law according to which there is no obligation on the part
of the receiving State to grant to envoys the right of affording asylum
to individuals not belonging to their suites. See, however, Moore, II.
§ 293.</p></div>
<p>Nowadays the official residences of envoys are <i>in
a sense and in some respects only</i> considered as though
they were outside the territory of the receiving States.
For the immunity of domicile granted to diplomatic
envoys comprises the inaccessibility of these residences
to officers of justice, police, or revenue, and the like,
of the receiving States without the special consent of
the respective envoys. Therefore, no act of jurisdiction
or administration of the receiving Governments
can take place within these residences, except by special
permission of the envoys. And the stables and carriages
of envoys are considered to be parts of their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span>
residences. But such immunity of domicile is granted
only in so far as it is necessary for the independence
and inviolability of envoys and the inviolability of
their official documents and archives. If an envoy
abuses this immunity, the receiving Government need
not bear it passively. There is, therefore, no obligation
on the part of the receiving State to grant an
envoy the right of affording asylum to criminals or to
other individuals not belonging to his suite. Of course,
an envoy need not deny entrance to criminals who
want to take refuge in the embassy. But he must
surrender them to the prosecuting Government at its
request, and, if he refuses, any measures may be taken
to induce him to do so, apart from such as would involve
an attack on his person. Thus, the embassy may
be surrounded by soldiers, and eventually the criminal
may even forcibly be taken out of the embassy. But
such measures of force are justifiable only if the case is
an urgent one, and after the envoy has in vain been
required to surrender the criminal. Further, if a crime
is committed inside the house of an envoy by an individual
who does not enjoy personally the privilege of
exterritoriality, the criminal must be surrendered to
the local Government. The case of Nikitschenkow,
which occurred in Paris in 1867, is an instance thereof.
Nikitschenkow, a Russian subject not belonging to the
Russian Legation, made an attempt on and wounded a
member of that legation within the precincts of the
embassy. The French police were called in and arrested
the criminal. The Russian Government required his
extradition, maintaining that, as the crime was committed
inside the Russian Embassy, it fell exclusively
under Russian jurisdiction; but the French Government
refused extradition and Russia dropped her claim.</p>
<p>Again, an envoy has no right to seize a subject of
his home State who is within the boundaries of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
receiving State and keep him under arrest inside the
embassy with the intention of bringing him away into
the power of his home State. An instance thereof is
the case of the Chinaman Sun Yat Sen which occurred
in London in 1896. This was a political refugee from
China living in London. He was induced to enter the
house of the Chinese Legation and kept under arrest
there in order to be conveyed forcibly to China, the
Chinese envoy contending that, as the house of the
legation was Chinese territory, the English Government
had no right to interfere. But the latter did interfere,
and Sun Yat Sen was released after several days.</p>
<p>As a contrast to this case may be mentioned that
of Kalkstein which occurred on the Continent in 1670.
Colonel von Kalkstein, a Prussian subject, had fled to
Poland for political reasons since he was accused of
high treason against the Prussian Government. Now
Frederic William, the great Elector of Brandenburg,
ordered his diplomatic envoy at Warsaw, the capital
of Poland, to obtain possession of the person of Kalkstein.
On November 28, 1670, this order was carried
out. Kalkstein was secretly seized, and, wrapped up
in a carpet, was carried across the frontier. He was
afterwards executed at Memel.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Exemption from Criminal and Civil Jurisdiction.</p></div>
<p>§ 391. The second privilege of envoys in reference
to their exterritoriality is their exemption from criminal
and civil jurisdiction. As their exemption from criminal
jurisdiction is also a consequence of their inviolability,
it has already been discussed,<a id="FNanchor_747_747"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_747_747">[747]</a> and we have here
to deal with their exemption from civil jurisdiction
only. No civil action of any kind as regards debts and
the like can be brought against them in the Civil Courts
of the receiving States. They cannot be arrested for
debts, nor can their furniture, their carriages, their
horses, and the like, be seized for debts. They cannot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span>
be prevented from leaving the country for not having
paid their debts, nor can their passports be refused to
them on the same account. Thus, when in 1772 the
French Government refused the passports to Baron de
Wrech, the envoy of the Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel at
Paris, for not having paid his debts, all the other
envoys in Paris complained of this act of the French
Government as a violation of International Law.<a id="FNanchor_748_748"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_748_748">[748]</a> But
the rule that an envoy is exempt from civil jurisdiction
has certain exceptions. If an envoy enters an
appearance to an action against himself, or if he himself
brings an action under the jurisdiction of the
receiving State, the courts of the latter have civil
jurisdiction in such cases over him. And the same
is valid as regards real property held within the boundaries
of the receiving State by an envoy, not in his
official character, but as a private individual, and as
regards mercantile<a id="FNanchor_749_749"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_749_749">[749]</a> ventures in which he might engage
on the territory of the receiving State.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_747_747"></a><a href="#FNanchor_747_747" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[747]</span></a> See
 above, §§ <a href="#As_regards_the387" class="pginternal">387</a>-388.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_748_748"></a><a href="#FNanchor_748_748" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[748]</span></a> See
 Martens, "Causes Célèbres," II. p. 282.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_749_749"></a><a href="#FNanchor_749_749" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[749]</span></a> The statute of 7 Anne, c. 12, on which the exemption of
diplomatic envoys from English jurisdiction is based, does not exclude
such envoy as embarks on mercantile ventures from the benefit of the
Act, and the practice of the English Courts grants, therefore, to
foreign envoys even in such cases exemption from local jurisdiction; see
the case (1859) of Magdalena Steam Navigation Co. <i>v.</i> Martin, 2 Ellis
and Ellis 94, overruling the case of Taylor <i>v.</i> Best, 14 C.B. 487. See
also Westlake, I. p. 267.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Exemption from Subpœna as witness.</p></div>
<p>§ 392. The third privilege of envoys in reference
to their exterritoriality is exemption from subpœna as
witnesses. No envoy can be obliged, or even required,
to appear as a witness in a civil or criminal or administrative
Court, nor is an envoy obliged to give evidence
before a Commissioner sent to his house. If, however,
an envoy chooses for himself to appear as a witness or
to give evidence of any kind, the Courts can make use
of such evidence. A remarkable case of this kind is
that of the Dutch envoy Dubois in Washington, which
happened in 1856. A case of homicide occurred in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span>
the presence of M. Dubois, and, as his evidence was
absolutely necessary for the trial, the Foreign Secretary
of the United States asked Dubois to appear before the
Court as a witness, recognising the fact that Dubois had
no duty to do so. When Dubois, on the advice of all
the other diplomatic envoys in Washington, refused to
comply with this desire, the United States brought the
matter before the Dutch Government. The latter, however,
approved of Dubois' refusal, but authorised him to
give evidence under oath before the American Foreign
Secretary. As, however, such evidence would have had
no value at all according to the local law, Dubois' evidence

States asked the Dutch Government to recall him.<a id="FNanchor_750_750"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_750_750">[750]</a></p>

 Wharton, I. § 98; Moore, IV. § 662; and Calvo, III. §
1520.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Exemption from Police.</p></div>
<p>§ 393. The fourth privilege of envoys in reference to
their exterritoriality is exemption from the police of
the receiving States. Orders and regulations of the
police do in no way bind them. On the other hand,
this exemption from police does not contain the privilege
of an envoy to do what he likes as regards matters
which are regulated by the police. Although such
regulations can in no way bind him, an envoy enjoys
the privilege of exemption from police under the presupposition
that he acts and behaves in such a manner
as harmonises with the internal order of the receiving
State. He is, therefore, expected to comply voluntarily
with all such commands and injunctions of the local
police as, on the one hand, do not restrict him in the
effective exercise of his duties, and, on the other hand,
are of importance for the general order and safety of
the community. Of course, he cannot be punished if
he acts otherwise, but the receiving Government may
request his recall or even be justified in other measures
of such a kind as do not injure his inviolability. Thus,
for instance, if in time of plague an envoy were not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span>
voluntarily to comply with important sanitary arrangements
of the local police, and if there were great danger
in delay, a case of necessity would be created and the
receiving Government would be justified in the exercise
of reasonable pressure upon the envoy.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Exemption from Taxes and the like.</p></div>
<p>§ 394. The fifth privilege of envoys in reference to
their exterritoriality is exemption from taxes and the
like. As an envoy, through his exterritoriality, is
considered not to be subjected to the territorial supremacy
of the receiving State, he must be exempt from
all direct personal taxation and therefore need not pay
either income-tax or other direct taxes. As regards
rates, it is necessary to draw a distinction. Payment
of rates imposed for local objects from which an envoy
himself derives benefit, such as sewerage, lighting,
water, night-watch, and the like, can be required of the
envoy, although this is often<a id="FNanchor_751_751"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_751_751">[751]</a> not done. Other rates,
however, such as poor-rates and the like, he cannot be
requested to pay. As regards customs duties, International
Law does not claim the exemption of envoys
therefrom. Practically and by courtesy, however, the
Municipal Laws of many States allow diplomatic envoys
within certain limits the entry free of duty of goods
intended for their own private use. If the house of an
envoy is the property of his home State or his own
property, the house need not be exempt from property
tax, although it is often so by the courtesy of the receiving
State. Such property tax is not a personal and
direct, but an indirect tax.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_751_751"></a><a href="#FNanchor_751_751" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[751]</span></a> As, for instance, in England where the payment of local
rates cannot be enforced by suit or distress against a member of a
legation; see Parkinson <i>v.</i> Potter, 16 Q.B. 152, and Macartney <i>v.</i>
Garbutt, L.R. 24 Q.B. 368. See also Westlake, I. p. 268.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Right of Chapel.</p></div>
<p>§ 395. A sixth privilege of envoys in reference to
their exterritoriality is the so-called Right of Chapel
(<i>Droit de chapelle</i> or <i>Droit du culte</i>). This is the privilege
of having a private chapel for the practice of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span>
own religion, which must be granted to an envoy by
the Municipal Law of the receiving State. A privilege
of great worth in former times, when freedom of religious
worship was unknown in most States, it has at
present an historical value only. But it has not disappeared,
and might become again of actual importance
in case a State should in the future give way to reactionary
intolerance. It must, however, be emphasised
that the right of chapel must only comprise the privilege
of religious worship in a private chapel inside the official
residence of the envoy. No right of having and tolling
bells need be granted. The privilege includes the office
of a chaplain, who must be allowed to perform every
religious ceremony within the chapel, such as baptism
and the like. It further includes permission to all the
compatriots of the envoy, even if they do not belong
to his retinue, to take part in the service. But the
receiving State need not allow its own subjects to take
part therein.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Self-jurisdiction.</p></div>
<p>§ 396. The seventh and last privilege of envoys in
reference to their exterritoriality is self-jurisdiction
within certain limits. As the members of his retinue
are considered exterritorial, the receiving State has no
jurisdiction over them, and the home State may therefore
delegate such civil and criminal jurisdiction to the
envoy. But no receiving State is required to grant
self-jurisdiction to an ambassador beyond a certain
reasonable limit. Thus, an envoy must have jurisdiction
over his retinue in matters of discipline, he
must be able to order the arrest of a member of his
retinue who has committed a crime and is to be sent
home for his trial, and the like. But no civilised State
would nowadays allow an envoy himself to try a member
of his retinue. This was done in former centuries.
Thus, in 1603, Sully, who was sent by Henri IV. of
France on a special mission to England, called together<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span>
a French jury in London and had a member of his
retinue condemned to death for murder. The convicted
man was handed over for execution to the
English authorities, but James I. reprieved him.<a id="FNanchor_752_752"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_752_752">[752]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Possible Cases.</p></div>
<p>§ 397. Although, when an individual is accredited
as diplomatic envoy by one State to another, these
two States only are directly concerned in his appointment,
the question must be discussed, what position
such envoy has as regards third States in those cases
in which he comes in contact with them. Several such
cases are possible. An envoy may, first, travel through
the territory of a third State to reach the territory of
the receiving State. Or, an envoy accredited to a
belligerent State and living on the latter's territory
may be found there by the other belligerent who militarily
occupies such territory. And, lastly, an envoy
accredited to a certain State might interfere with the
affairs of a third State.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Envoy travelling through Territory of third State.</p></div>
<p>§ 398. If an envoy travels through the territory of
a third State incognito or for his pleasure only, there
is no doubt that he cannot claim any special privileges
whatever. He is in exactly the same position as any
other foreign individual travelling on this territory,
although by courtesy he might be treated with particular
attention. But matters are different when an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span>
envoy on his way from his own State to the State of his
destination travels through the territory of a third
State. If the sending and the receiving States are not
neighbours, the envoy probably has to travel through
the territory of a third State. Now, as the institution
of legation is a necessary one for the intercourse of
States and is firmly established by International Law,
there ought to be no doubt whatever that such third
State must grant the right of innocent passage (<i>jus
transitus innoxii</i>) to the envoy, provided that it is not
at war with the sending or the receiving State. But
no other privileges,<a id="FNanchor_753_753"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_753_753">[753]</a> especially those of inviolability
and exterritoriality need be granted to the envoy.
And the right of innocent passage does not include the
right to stop on the territory longer than is necessary
for the passage. Thus, in 1854, Soulé, the envoy of
the United States of America at Madrid, who had
landed at Calais, intending to return to Madrid <i>via</i>
Paris, was provisionally stopped at Calais for the purpose
of ascertaining whether he intended to make a
stay in Paris, which the French Government wanted to
prevent, because he was a French refugee naturalised
in America and was reported to have made speeches
against the Emperor Napoleon. Soulé at once left
Calais, and the French Government declared, during
the correspondence with the United States in the
matter, that there was no objection to Soulé's traversing
France on his way to Madrid, but they would not allow
him to make a sojourn in Paris or anywhere else in
France.<a id="FNanchor_754_754"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_754_754">[754]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_753_753"></a><a href="#FNanchor_753_753" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[753]</span></a> The matter, which has always been disputed, is fully
discussed by Twiss, I. § 222, who also quotes the opinion of Grotius,
Bynkershoek, and Vattel.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_754_754"></a><a href="#FNanchor_754_754" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[754]</span></a> See
 Wharton, I. § 97, and Moore, IV. § 643.</p></div>
<p>It must be specially remarked that no right of
passage need be granted if the third State is at war with
the sending or receiving State. The envoy of a belligerent,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span>
who travels through the territory of the other
belligerent to reach the place of his destination, may
be seized and treated as a prisoner of war. Thus, in
1744, when the French Ambassador, Maréchal de Belle-Isle,
on his way to Berlin, passed through the territory
of Hanover, which country was then, together with
England, at war with France, he was made a prisoner
of war and sent to England.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Envoy found by Belligerent on occupied Enemy Territory.</p></div>
<p>§ 399. <a id="Wh399"></a>When in time of war a belligerent occupies
the capital of an enemy State and finds there envoys of
other States, these envoys do not lose their diplomatic
privileges as long as the State to which they are accredited
is in existence. As military occupation does
not extinguish a State subjected thereto, such envoys
do not cease to be envoys. On the other hand, they
are not accredited to the belligerent who has taken
possession of the territory by military force, and the
question is not yet settled by International Law how
far the occupying belligerent has to respect the inviolability
and exterritoriality granted to such envoys
by the law of the land in compliance with a demand
of International Law. It may safely be maintained
that he must grant them the right to leave the occupied
territory. But must he likewise grant them the right
to stay? Has he to respect their immunity of domicile
and their other privileges in reference to their exterritoriality?
Neither customary rules nor international
conventions exist as regards these questions, which
must, therefore, be treated as open. The only case
which occurred concerning this problem is that of Mr.
Washburne, ambassador of the United States in Paris
during the siege of that town in 1870 by the Germans.
This ambassador claimed the right of sending a messenger
with despatches to London in a sealed bag
through the German lines. But the Germans refused
to grant that right, and did not alter their decision<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span>
although the Government of the United States protested.<a id="FNanchor_755_755"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_755_755">[755]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Envoy interfering with affairs of a third State.</p></div>
<p>§ 400. There is no doubt that an envoy must not
interfere with affairs concerning the State to which he is
accredited and a third State. If nevertheless he does
interfere, he enjoys no privileges whatever against such
third State. Thus, in 1734, the Marquis de Monti, the
French envoy in Poland, who took an active part in
the war between Poland and Russia, was made a prisoner
of war by the latter and not released till 1736,
although France protested.<a id="FNanchor_756_756"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_756_756">[756]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Different Classes of Members of Retinue.</p></div>
<p>§ 401. <a id="The_individuals_accompanying401"></a>The individuals accompanying an envoy
officially, or in his private service, or as members of
his family, or as couriers, compose his retinue. The
members of the retinue belong, therefore, to four different
classes. All those individuals who are officially
attached to an envoy are members of the legation and
are appointed by the home State of the envoy. To
this first class belong the Councillors, Attachés, Secretaries
of the Legation; the Chancellor of the Legation
and his assistants; the interpreters, and the like; the
chaplain, the doctor, and the legal advisers, provided
that they are appointed by the home State and sent
specially as members of the legation. A list of these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span>
members of legation is handed over by the envoy to
the Secretary for Foreign Affairs of the receiving State
and is revised from time to time. The Councillors and
Secretaries of Legation are personally presented to the
Secretary for Foreign Affairs, and very often also to
the head of the receiving State. The second class comprises
all those individuals who are in the private
service of the envoy and of the members of legation,
such as servants of all kinds, the private secretary of
the envoy, the tutor and the governess of his children.
The third class consists of the members of the family
of the envoy—namely, his wife, children, and such of
his other near relatives as live within his family and
under his roof. And, lastly, the fourth class consists
of the so-called couriers. They are the bearers of
despatches sent by the envoy to his home State, who on
their way back also bear despatches from the home
State to the envoy. Such couriers are attached to
most legations for the guarantee of the safety and
secrecy of the despatches.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Privileges of Members of Legation.</p></div>
<p>§ 402. It is a universally recognised<a id="FNanchor_757_757"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_757_757">[757]</a> rule of International
Law that all members of a legation are as
inviolable and exterritorial as the envoy himself. They
must, therefore, be granted by the receiving State
exemption from criminal and civil jurisdiction, exemption
from police,<a id="FNanchor_758_758"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_758_758">[758]</a> subpœna as witnesses, and taxes. They
are considered, like the envoy himself, to retain their
domicile within their home State. Children born to
them during their stay within the receiving State are
considered born on the territory of the home State.
And it must be emphasised that it is not within the
envoy's power to waive these privileges of members<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span>
of legation, although the home State itself can waive
these privileges. Thus when, in 1909, Wilhelm Beckert,
the Chancellor of the German Legation in Santiago de
Chili, murdered the porter of this legation, a Chilian
subject, and then set fire to the Chancery in order to
conceal his embezzlements of money belonging to the
legation, the German Government consented to his
being prosecuted in Chili; he was tried, found guilty,
and executed at Santiago on July 5, 1910.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_757_757"></a><a href="#FNanchor_757_757" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[757]</span></a> Some authors, however, plead for an abrogation of this
rule. See Martens, II. § 16.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_758_758"></a><a href="#FNanchor_758_758" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[758]</span></a> A case of this kind occurred in 1904 in the United States.
Mr. Gurney, Secretary of the British Legation at Washington, was fined
by the police magistrate of Lee, in Massachusetts, for furiously driving
a motor-car. But the judgment was afterwards annulled, and the fine
imposed remitted.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Privileges of Private Servants.</p></div>
<p>§ 403. It is a customary rule of International Law
that the receiving State must grant to all persons in
the private service of the envoy and of the members
of his legation, provided such persons are not subjects
of the receiving State, exemption from civil and criminal
jurisdiction.<a id="FNanchor_759_759"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_759_759">[759]</a> But the envoy can disclaim these
exemptions, and these persons cannot then claim exemption
from police, immunity of domicile, and exemption
from taxes. Thus, for instance, if such a private
servant commits a crime outside the residence of his
employer, the police can arrest him; he must, however,
be at once released if the envoy does not waive the
exemption from criminal jurisdiction.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_759_759"></a><a href="#FNanchor_759_759" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[759]</span></a> This rule seems to be everywhere recognised except in Great
Britain. When, in 1827, a coachman of Mr. Gallatin, the American
Minister in London, committed an assault outside the embassy, he was
arrested in the stable of the embassy and charged before a local
magistrate, and the British Foreign Office refused to recognise the
exemption of the coachman from the local jurisdiction. See Wharton, I. §
94, and Hall, § 50.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Privileges of Family of Envoy.</p></div>
<p>§ 404. Although the wife of the envoy, his children,
and such of his near relatives as live within his family
and under his roof belong to his retinue, there is a
distinction to be made as regards their privileges. His
wife must certainly be granted all his privileges in so
far as they concern inviolability and exterritoriality.
As regards, however, his children and other relatives,
no general rule of International Law can safely be said
to be generally recognised, but that they must be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span>
granted exemption from civil and criminal jurisdiction.
But even this rule was formerly not generally recognised.
Thus, when in 1653 Don Pantaleon Sà, the brother of
the Portuguese Ambassador in London and a member
of his suite, killed an Englishman named Greenway, he
was arrested, tried in England, found guilty, and executed.<a id="FNanchor_760_760"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_760_760">[760]</a>
Nowadays the exemption from civil and criminal
jurisdiction of such members of an envoy's family
as live under his roof is always granted. Thus, when
in 1906 Carlo Waddington,<a id="FNanchor_761_761"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_761_761">[761]</a> the son of the Chilian
envoy at Brussels, murdered the secretary of the
Chilian Legation, the Belgian authorities did not take
any step to arrest him. Two days afterwards, however,
the Chilian envoy waived the privilege of the immunity
of his son, and on March 2 the Chilian Government likewise
agreed to the murderer being prosecuted in Belgium.
The trial took place in July 1907, but Waddington was
acquitted by the Belgian jury.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Termination in contradistinction to Suspension.</p></div>
<p>§ 406. A diplomatic mission may come to an end
from eleven different causes—namely, accomplishment
of the object for which the mission was sent; expiration
of such Letters of Credence as were given to an
envoy for a specific time only; recall of the envoy
by the sending State; his promotion to a higher class;
the delivery of passports to him by the receiving State;
request of the envoy for his passports on account of
ill-treatment; war between the sending and the receiving
State; constitutional changes in the headship
of the sending or receiving State; revolutionary change
of government of the sending or receiving State; extinction
of the sending or receiving State; and, lastly,
death of the envoy. These events must be treated
singly on account of their peculiarities. But the termination
of diplomatic missions must not be confounded
with their suspension. Whereas from the foregoing
eleven causes a mission comes actually to an end, and
new Letters of Credence are necessary, a suspension
does not put an end to the mission, but creates an
interval during which the envoy, although he remains
in office, cannot exercise his office. Suspension may be
the result of various causes, as, for instance, a revolution
within the sending or receiving State. Whatever
the cause may be, an envoy enjoys all his privileges
during the duration of the suspension.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Accomplishment of Object of Mission.</p></div>
<p>§ 407. A mission comes to an end through the fulfilment
of its objects in all cases of missions for special<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span>
purposes. Such cases may be ceremonial functions like
representations at weddings, funerals, coronations; or
notification of changes in the headship of a State, or
representation of a State at Conferences and Congresses;
and other cases. Although the mission is terminated
through the accomplishment of its object, the envoys
enjoy all their privileges on their way home.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Expiration of Letter of Credence.</p></div>
<p>§ 408. If a Letter of Credence for a specified time
only is given to an envoy, his mission terminates with
the expiration of such time. A temporary Letter of
Credence may, for instance, be given to an individual
for the purpose of representing a State diplomatically
during the interval between the recall of an ambassador
and the appointment of his successor.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Recall.</p></div>
<p>§ 409. The mission of an envoy, be he permanently
or only temporarily appointed, terminates through his
recall by the sending State. If this recall is not caused
by unfriendly acts of the receiving State but by other
circumstances, the envoy receives a Letter of Recall
from the head, or, in case he is only a Chargé d'Affaires,
from the Foreign Secretary of his home State, and he<a id="FNanchor_762_762"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_762_762">[762]</a>
hands this letter over to the head of the receiving State
in a solemn audience, or in the case of a Chargé d'Affaires
to the Foreign Secretary. In exchange for the Letter
of Recall the envoy receives his passports and a so-called
<i>Lettre de récréance</i>, a letter in which the head of
the receiving State (or the Foreign Secretary) acknowledges
the Letter of Recall. Although therewith his
mission ends, he enjoys nevertheless all his privileges
on his home journey.<a id="FNanchor_763_763"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_763_763">[763]</a> A recall may be caused by the
resignation of the envoy, by his transference to another
post, and the like. It may, secondly, be caused by the
outbreak of a conflict between the sending and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span>
receiving State which leads to a rupture of diplomatic
intercourse, and under these circumstances the sending
State may order its envoy to ask for his passports and
depart at once without handing in a Letter of Recall.
And, thirdly, a recall may result from a request of the
receiving State by reason of real or alleged misconduct
of the envoy. Such request of recall<a id="FNanchor_764_764"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_764_764">[764]</a> may lead to a
rupture of diplomatic intercourse, if the receiving State
insists upon the recall, although the sending State does
not recognise the act of its envoy as misconduct.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_762_762"></a><a href="#FNanchor_762_762" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[762]</span></a> But sometimes his successor presents the letter recalling
his predecessor to the head of the receiving State, or to the Foreign
Secretary in the case of Chargés d'Affaires.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Promotion to a higher Class.</p></div>
<p>§ 410. When an envoy remains at his post, but is
promoted to a higher class—for instance, when a Chargé
d'Affaires is created a Minister Resident or a Minister
Plenipotentiary is created an Ambassador—his original
mission technically ends, and he receives therefore a
new Letter of Credence.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Delivery of Passports.</p></div>
<p>§ 411. <a id="A_mission_may411"></a>A mission may terminate, further, through
the delivery of his passports to an envoy by the receiving
State. The reason for such dismissal of an
envoy may be either gross misconduct on his part or
a quarrel between the sending and the receiving State
which leads to a rupture of diplomatic intercourse.
Whenever such rupture takes place, diplomatic relations
between the two States come to an end and all diplomatic
privileges cease with the envoy's departing and
crossing the frontier. If the archives of the legations
are not removed, they must be put under seal by the
departing envoy and confided to the protection<a id="FNanchor_765_765"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_765_765">[765]</a> of
some other foreign legation.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Request for Passports.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Outbreak of War.</p></div>
<p>§ 413. <a id="Wh413"></a>When war breaks out between the sending
and the receiving State before their envoys accredited
to each other are recalled, their mission nevertheless
comes to an end. They receive their passports, but
nevertheless they must be granted their privileges<a id="FNanchor_766_766"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_766_766">[766]</a> on

<div class="sidenote"><p>Constitutional Changes.</p></div>
<p>§ 414. If the head of the sending or receiving State
is a Sovereign, his death or abdication terminates the
missions sent and received by him, and all envoys
remaining at their posts must receive new Letters of
Credence. But if they receive new Letters of Credence,
no change in seniority is considered to have taken
place from the order in force before the change. And
during the time between the termination of the missions
and the arrival of new Letters of Credence they enjoy
nevertheless all the privileges of diplomatic envoys.</p>
<p>As regards the influence of constitutional changes
in the headship of republics on the missions sent or
received, no certain rule exists.<a id="FNanchor_767_767"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_767_767">[767]</a> Everything depends,
therefore, upon the merits of the special case.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_767_767"></a><a href="#FNanchor_767_767" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[767]</span></a> Writers on International Law differ concerning this point.
See, for instance, Ullmann, § 53, in contradistinction to Rivier, I. p.
517.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Revolutionary Changes of Government.</p></div>
<p>§ 415. A revolutionary movement in the sending
or receiving State which creates a new government,
changing, for example, a republic into a monarchy or
a monarchy into a republic, or deposing a Sovereign
and enthroning another, terminates the missions. All
envoys remaining at their posts must receive new
Letters of Credence, but no change in seniority takes
place if they receive them. It happens that in cases of
revolutionary changes of government foreign States for
some time neither send new Letters of Credence to their
envoys nor recall them, watching the course of events
in the meantime and waiting for more proof of a real
settlement. In such cases the envoys are, according
to an international usage, granted all privileges of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span>
diplomatic envoys, although in strict law they have
ceased to be such. In cases of recall subsequent to
revolutionary changes, the protection of subjects of the
recalling States remains in the hands of their consuls,
since the consular office<a id="FNanchor_768_768"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_768_768">[768]</a> does not come to an end through
constitutional or revolutionary changes in the headship
of a State.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Extinction of sending or receiving State.</p></div>
<p>§ 416. If the sending or receiving State of a mission
is extinguished by voluntary merger into another State
or through annexation in consequence of conquest, the
mission terminates <i>ipso facto</i>. In case of annexation
of the receiving State, there can be no doubt that,
although the annexing State will not consider the envoys
received by the annexed State as accredited to itself,
it must grant those envoys the right to leave the territory
of the annexed State unmolested and to take their
archives away with them. In case of annexation of
the sending State, the question arises what becomes
of the archives and legational property of the missions
of the annexed State accredited to foreign States. This
question is one on the so-called succession<a id="FNanchor_769_769"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_769_769">[769]</a> of States.
The annexing State acquires, <i>ipso facto</i>, by the annexation
the property in those archives and other legational
goods, such as the hotels, furniture, and the like.
But as long as the annexation is not notified and recognised,
the receiving States have no duty to interfere.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Death of Envoy.</p></div>
<p>§ 417. A mission ends, lastly, by the death of the
envoy. As soon as an envoy is dead, his effects, and
especially his papers, must be sealed. This is done by
a member of the dead envoy's legation, or, if there be
no such members, by a member of another legation
accredited to the same State. The local Government
must not interfere, unless at the special request by
the home State of the deceased envoy.</p>
<p>Although the mission and therefore the privileges of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span>
the envoy come to an end by his death, the members
of his family who resided under his roof and the members
of his suite enjoy their privileges until they leave the
country. But a certain time may be fixed for them
to depart, and on its expiration they lose their privilege
of exterritoriality. It must be specially mentioned
that the Courts of the receiving State have no jurisdiction
whatever over the goods and effects of the
deceased envoy, and that no death duties can be demanded.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Development of the Institution of Consuls.</p></div>
<p>§ 418. The roots of the consular institution go back
to the second half of the Middle Ages. In the commercial
towns of Italy, Spain, and France the merchants
used to appoint by election one or more of their
fellow-merchants as arbitrators in commercial disputes,
who were called <i>Juges Consuls</i> or <i>Consuls Marchands</i>.
When, between and after the Crusades, Italian, Spanish,
and French merchants settled down in the Eastern
countries, founding factories, they brought the institution
of consuls with them, the merchants belonging to
the same nation electing their own consul. The competence
of these consuls became, however, more and
more enlarged through treaties, so-called "Capitulations,"
between the home States of the merchants and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>
the Mohammedan monarchs on whose territories these
merchants had settled down.<a id="FNanchor_770_770"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_770_770">[770]</a> The competence of
consuls comprised at last the whole civil and criminal
jurisdiction over, and protection of, the privileges, the
life, and the property of their countrymen. From the
East the institution of consuls was transferred to the
West. Thus, in the fifteenth century Italian consuls
existed in the Netherlands and in London, English
consuls in the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Denmark,
Italy (Pisa). These consuls in the West exercised, just
as those in the East, exclusive civil and criminal jurisdiction
over the merchants of their nationality. But
the position of the consuls in the West decayed in the
beginning of the seventeenth century through the influence
of the rising permanent legations on the one hand,
and, on the other, from the fact that everywhere foreign
merchants were brought under the civil and criminal
jurisdiction of the State in which they resided. This
change in their competence altered the position of
consuls in the Christian States of the West altogether.
Their functions now shrank into a general supervision
of the commerce and navigation of their home States,
and into a kind of protection of the commercial interests
of their countrymen. Consequently, they did not receive
much notice in the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries, and it was not until the nineteenth century
that the general development of international commerce,
navigation, and shipping drew the attention of
the Governments again to the value and importance of
the institution of consuls. The institution was now
systematically developed. The position of the consuls,
their functions, and their privileges, were the subjects
of stipulations either in commercial treaties or in special
consular treaties,<a id="FNanchor_771_771"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_771_771">[771]</a> and the several States enacted statutes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span>
regarding the duties of their consuls abroad, such as
the Consular Act passed by England in 1826.<a id="FNanchor_772_772"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_772_772">[772]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>General Character of Consuls.</p></div>
<p>§ 419. Nowadays consuls are agents of States residing
abroad for purposes of various kinds, but mainly
in the interests of commerce and navigation of the
appointing State. As they are not diplomatic representatives,
they do not enjoy the privileges of diplomatists.
Nor have they, ordinarily, anything to do with
intercourse between their home State and the State
in which they reside. But these rules have exceptions.
Consuls of Christian Powers in non-Christian States,
Japan now excepted, have retained their former competence
and exercise full civil and criminal jurisdiction
over their countrymen. And sometimes consuls are
charged with the tasks which are regularly fulfilled by
diplomatic representatives. Thus, in States under
suzerainty the Powers are frequently represented by
consuls, who transact all the business otherwise transacted
by diplomatic representatives, and who have,
therefore, often the title of "Diplomatic Agents."
Thus, too, on occasions small States, instead of accrediting
diplomatic envoys to another State, send only
a consul thither, who combines the consular functions
with those of a diplomatic envoy. It must, however, be
emphasised that consuls thereby neither become diplomatic
envoys, although they may have the title of
"Diplomatic Agents," nor enjoy the diplomatic envoys'
privileges, if such privileges are not specially provided
for by treaties between the home State and the State
in which they reside. Different, however, is the case in
which a consul is at the same time accredited as Chargé
d'Affaires, and in which, therefore, he combines two
different offices; for as Chargé d'Affaires he is a diplomatic
envoy and enjoys all the privileges of such an
envoy, provided he has received a Letter of Credence.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span></p>

Consul," pp. 186-206—"General Instructions for His Majesty's Consular
Officers" (1907).</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Different kinds of Consuls.</p></div>
<p>§ 420. Consuls are of two kinds. They are either
specially sent and paid for the administration of their
consular office (<i>Consules missi</i>), or they are appointed
from individuals, in most cases merchants, residing in
the district for which they are to administer the consular
office (<i>Consules electi</i>).<a id="FNanchor_773_773"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_773_773">[773]</a> Consuls of the first kind,
who are so-called professional consuls and are always
subjects of the sending State, have to devote their
whole time to the consular office. Consuls of the second
kind, who may or may not be subjects of the sending
State, administer the consular office besides following
their ordinary callings. Some States, such as France,
appoint professional consuls only; most States, however,
appoint Consuls of both kinds according to the
importance of the consular districts. But there is a
general tendency with most States to appoint professional
consuls for important districts.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_773_773"></a><a href="#FNanchor_773_773" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[773]</span></a> To this distinction corresponds in the British Consular
Service the distinction between "Consular Officers" and "Trading
Consular Officers."</p></div>
<p>No difference exists between the two kinds of consuls
as to their general position according to International
Law. But, naturally, a professional consul enjoys
actually a greater authority and a more important
social position, and consular treaties often stipulate
special privileges for professional consuls.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Consular Districts.</p></div>
<p>§ 421. As the functions of consuls are of a more or
less local character, most States appoint several consuls
on the territory of other larger States, limiting the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span>
duties of the several consuls within certain districts
of such territories or even within a certain town or
port only. Such consular districts as a rule coincide
with provinces of the State in which the consuls administer
their offices. The different consuls appointed
by a State for different districts of the same State are
independent of each other and conduct their correspondence
directly with the Foreign Office of their home
State, the agents-consular excepted, who correspond
with their nominators only. The extent of the districts
is agreed upon between the home State of the consul
and the admitting State. Only the consul appointed
for a particular district is entitled to exercise consular
functions within its boundaries, and to him only the local
authorities have to grant the consular privileges, if any.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Different Classes of Consuls.</p></div>
<p>§ 422. Four classes of consuls are generally distinguished
according to rank: consuls-general, consuls,
vice-consuls, and agents-consular. Consuls-general are
appointed either as the head of several consular districts,
and have then several consuls subordinate to
themselves, or as the head of one very large consular
district. Consuls are usually appointed for smaller
districts, and for towns or even ports only. Vice-consuls
are such assistants of consuls-general and
consuls as themselves possess the consular character
and take, therefore, the consul's place in regard to the
whole consular business; they are, according to the
Municipal Law of some States, appointed by the consul,
subject to the approbation of his home State. Agents-consular
are agents with consular character, appointed,
subject to the approbation of the home Government,
by a consul-general or consul for the exercise of
certain parts of the consular functions in certain towns
or other places of the consular district. Agents-consular
are not independent of the appointing consul, and do
not correspond directly with the home State, as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span>
appointing consul is responsible to his Government for
the agents-consular. The so-called Proconsul is not a
consul, but a <i>locum tenens</i> of a consul only during the
latter's temporary absence or illness; he possesses,
therefore, consular character for such time only as he
actually is the <i>locum tenens</i>.</p>
<p>The British Consular Service consists of the following
six ranks: (1) Agents and consuls-general, commissioners
and consuls-general; (2) consuls-general; (3) consuls;
(4) vice-consuls; (5) consular agents; (6) proconsuls.
In the British Consular Service pro-consuls only exercise,
as a rule, the notarial functions of a consular officer.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Consuls subordinate to Diplomatic Envoys.</p></div>
<p>§ 423. Although consuls conduct their correspondence
directly with their home Government, they are
nevertheless, subordinate to the diplomatic envoy of
their home Government accredited to the State in which
they administer the consular offices. According to the
Municipal Law of almost every State except the United
States of America, the diplomatic envoy has full
authority and control over the consuls. He can give
instructions and orders, which they have to execute.
In doubtful cases they have to ask his advice and instructions.
On the other hand, the diplomatic envoy
has to protect the consuls in case they are injured by
the local Government.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Qualification of Candidates.</p></div>
<p>§ 424. International Law has no rules in regard to
the qualifications of an individual whom a State can
appoint consul. Many States, however, possess such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span>
rules in their Municipal Law as far as professional
consuls are concerned. The question, whether female
consuls could be appointed, cannot be answered in the
negative, but, on the other hand, no State is obliged
to grant female consuls the <i>exequatur</i>, and many States
would at present certainly refuse it.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>No State obliged to admit Consuls.</p></div>
<p>§ 425. According to International Law a State is
not at all obliged to admit consuls. But the commercial
interests of all the States are so powerful that
practically every State must admit consuls of foreign
Powers, as a State which refused such admittance would
in its turn not be allowed to have its own consuls abroad.
The commercial and consular treaties between two
States stipulate as a rule that the contracting States
shall have the right to appoint consuls in all those parts
of each other's country in which consuls of third States
are already or shall in future be admitted. Consequently
a State cannot refuse admittance to a consul of one
State for a certain district if it admits a consul of another
State. But as long as a State has not admitted
any other State's consul for a district, it can refuse
admittance to a consul of the State anxious to organise
consular service in that district. Thus, for instance,
Russia refused for a long time for political reasons to
admit consuls in Warsaw.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>What kind of States can appoint Consuls.</p></div>
<p>§ 426. There is no doubt that it is within the faculty
of every full-Sovereign State to appoint consuls. As
regards not full-Sovereign States, everything depends
upon the special case. As foreign States can appoint
consuls in States under suzerainty, it cannot be doubted
that, provided the contrary is not specially stipulated
between the vassal and the suzerain State, and provided

regard to member-States of a Federal State it is the

<div class="sidenote"><p>Mode of Appointment and of Admittance.</p></div>
<p>§ 427. <a id="Consuls_are_appointed427"></a>Consuls are appointed through a patent or
commission, the so-called <i>Lettre de provision</i>, of the
State whose consular office they are intended to administer.
Vice-consuls are sometimes, and agents-consular
are always, appointed by the consul, subject to
the approval of the home State. Admittance of consuls
takes place through the so-called <i>exequatur</i>, granted by
the head of the admitting State.<a id="FNanchor_775_775"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_775_775">[775]</a> The diplomatic
envoy of the appointing State hands the patent of the
appointed consul on to the Secretary for Foreign Affairs
for communication to the head of the State, and the
<i>exequatur</i> is given either in a special document or by
means of the word <i>exequatur</i> written across the patent.
But the <i>exequatur</i> can be refused for personal reasons.
Thus, in 1869 England refused the <i>exequatur</i> to an Irishman
named Haggerty, who was naturalised in the
United States and appointed American consul for
Glasgow. And the <i>exequatur</i> can be withdrawn for
personal reasons at any moment. Thus, in 1834 France
withdrew it from the Prussian consul at Bayonne for
having helped in getting into Spain supplies of arms
for the Carlists.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_775_775"></a><a href="#FNanchor_775_775" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[775]</span></a> That, in case a consul is appointed for a State which is
under the protectorate of another, it is within the competence of the
latter to grant or refuse the <i>exequatur</i>, has been pointed out above, §
92, p. 144, note 4.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Appointment of Consuls includes Recognition.</p></div>
<p>§ 428. As the appointment of consuls takes place in
the interests of commerce, industry, and navigation, and
has merely local importance without political consequences,
it is maintained<a id="FNanchor_776_776"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_776_776">[776]</a> that a State does not indirectly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span>
recognise a newly created State <i>ipso facto</i> by appointing a
consul to a district in such State. This opinion, however,
does not agree with the facts of international life. Since
no consul can exercise his functions before he has handed
over his patent to the local State and received the latter's
<i>exequatur</i>, it is evident that thereby the appointing
State enters into such formal intercourse with the admitting
State as indirectly<a id="FNanchor_777_777"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_777_777">[777]</a> involves recognition. But
it is only if consuls are formally appointed and formally
receive the <i>exequatur</i> on the part of the receiving State,
that indirect recognition is involved. If, on the other
hand, no formal<a id="FNanchor_778_778"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_778_778">[778]</a> appointment is made, and no formal
<i>exequatur</i> is asked for and received, foreign individuals
may actually with the consent of the local State exercise
the functions of consuls without recognition following
therefrom. Such individuals are not really consuls,
although the local State allows them for political reasons
to exercise consular functions.</p>

II. § 23—Stowell, "Le Consul," pp. 15-136.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>On Consular Functions in general.</p></div>
<p>§ 429. Although consuls are appointed chiefly in
the interest of commerce, industry, and navigation,
they are nevertheless charged with various functions
for other purposes. Custom, commercial and consular
treaties, Municipal Laws, and Municipal Consular Instructions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span>
contain detailed rules in regard to these
functions. They may be grouped under the heads of
fosterage of commerce and industry, supervision of
navigation, protection, notarial functions.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Fosterage of Commerce and Industry.</p></div>
<p>§ 430. As consuls are appointed in the interest of
commerce and industry, they must be allowed by the
receiving State to watch over the execution of the
commercial treaties of their home State, to send reports
to the latter in regard to everything which can influence
the development of its commerce and industry, and to
give such information to merchants and manufacturers
of the appointing State as is necessary for the protection
of their commercial interests. Municipal Laws
of the several States and their Consular Instructions
comprise detailed rules on these consular functions,
which are of the greatest importance. Consular reports,
on the one hand, and consular information to
members of the commercial world, on the other, have
in the past and the present rendered valuable assistance
to the development of commerce and industry of their
home States.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Supervision of Navigation.</p></div>
<p>§ 431. Another task of consuls consists in supervision
of the navigation of the appointing State. A
consul at a port must be allowed to keep his eye on all
merchantmen sailing under the flag of his home State
which enter the port, to control and legalise their ship
papers, to exercise the power of inspecting them on their
arrival and departure, to settle disputes between the
master and the crew or the passengers. He assists
sailors in distress, undertakes the sending home of shipwrecked
crews and passengers, attests averages. It is
neither necessary nor possible to enumerate all the
duties and powers of consuls in regard to supervision of
navigation. Consular and commercial treaties, on the
one hand, and, on the other, Municipal Laws and Consular
Instructions, comprise detailed rules regarding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span>
these consular functions. It should, however, be added
that consuls must assist in every possible way any
public vessel of their home State which enters their
port, if the commander so requests. But consuls have
no power of supervision over such public vessels.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Protection.</p></div>
<p>§ 432. The protection which consuls must be
allowed by the receiving State to provide for subjects
of the appointing State is a very important task. For
that purpose consuls keep a register, in which these
subjects can have their names and addresses recorded.
Consuls make out passports, they have to render a certain
assistance and help to paupers and the sick, and to litigants
before the Courts. If a foreign subject is wronged
by the local authorities, his consul has to give him advice
and help, and has eventually to interfere on his behalf.
If a foreigner dies, his consul may be approached for
securing his property and for rendering all kind of
assistance and help to the family of the deceased.</p>
<p>As a rule, a consul exercises protective functions over
subjects of the appointing State only; but the latter
may charge him with the protection of subjects of other
States which have not nominated a consul for his
district.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Notarial Functions.</p></div>
<p>§ 433. Very important are the notarial and the
like functions with which consuls are charged. They
attest and legalise signatures, examine witnesses and
administer oaths for the purpose of procuring evidence
for the Courts and other authorities of the appointing
State. They conclude or register marriages of the latter's
subjects, take charge of their wills, legalise their adoptions,
register their births and deaths. They provide
authorised translations for local as well as for home
authorities, and furnish attestations of many kinds. All
consular functions of this kind are specialised by Municipal
Laws and Consular Instructions. But it should
be specially observed that whereas fosterage of commerce,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span>
supervision of navigation, and protection are
functions the exercise of which must, according to a
customary rule of International Law, be granted to
consuls by receiving States, many of their notarial
functions need not be permitted by such receiving
States in the absence of treaty stipulations.</p>

(1899)—Stowell, "Le Consul," pp. 137-185.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Position.</p></div>
<p>§ 434. Like diplomatic envoys, consuls are simply
objects of International Law. Such rights as they have
are granted to them by Municipal Laws in compliance
with rights of the appointing States according to
International Law.<a id="FNanchor_779_779"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_779_779">[779]</a> As regards their position, it should
nowadays be an established and uncontested fact that
consuls do not enjoy the position of diplomatic envoys,
since no Christian State actually grants to foreign
consuls the privileges of diplomatic agents. On the
other hand, it would be incorrect to maintain that their
position is in no way different from that of any other
individual living within the consular district. Since
they are appointed by foreign States and have received
the <i>exequatur</i>, they are publicly recognised by the admitting
State as agents of the appointing State. Of
course, consuls are not diplomatic representatives, for
they do not represent the appointing States in the
totality of their international relations, but for a limited
number of tasks and for local purposes only. Yet they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span>
bear a recognised public character, in contradistinction
to mere private individuals, and, consequently, their
position is different from that of mere private individuals.
This is certainly the case with regard to
professional consuls, who are officials of their home
State and are specially sent to the foreign State for the
purpose of administering the consular office. But in
regard to non-professional consuls it must likewise be
maintained that the admitting State by granting the
<i>exequatur</i> recognises their official position towards itself,
which demands at least a special protection<a id="FNanchor_780_780"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_780_780">[780]</a> of their
persons and residences. The official position of consuls,
however, does not involve direct intercourse with
the Government of the admitting State. Consuls are
appointed for <i>local</i> purposes only, and they have, therefore,
direct intercourse with the <i>local authorities</i> only.
If they want to approach the Government itself, they
can do so only through the diplomatic envoy, to whom
they are subordinate.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_779_779"></a><a href="#FNanchor_779_779" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[779]</span></a> See
 above, § <a href="#Diplomatic_envoys384" class="pginternal">384</a>.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_780_780"></a><a href="#FNanchor_780_780" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[780]</span></a> According to British and American practice a consul of a
neutral Power accredited to the enemy State who embarks upon mercantile
ventures, is not by his official position protected against seizure of
his goods carried by enemy vessels, for by trading in the enemy country
he acquires to a certain extent enemy character; see the case of the
Indian Chief, 3 C. Rob. 12.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Consular Privileges.</p></div>
<p>§ 435. From the undoubted official position of consuls
no universally recognised privileges of importance
emanate as yet. Apart from the special protection due
to consuls according to International Law, there is
neither a custom nor a universal agreement between the
Powers to grant them important privileges. Such
privileges as consuls actually enjoy are granted to them
either by courtesy or in compliance with special stipulations
of a Commercial or Consular Treaty between
the sending and the admitting State. I doubt not that
in time the Powers will agree upon a universal treaty
in regard to the position and privileges of consuls.<a id="FNanchor_781_781"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_781_781">[781]</a>
Meanwhile,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span> it is of interest to take notice of some of
the more important stipulations which are to be found
in the innumerable treaties between the several States
in regard to consular privileges:</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_781_781"></a><a href="#FNanchor_781_781" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[781]</span></a> The Institute of International Law at its meeting at Venice
in 1896 adopted a <i>Règlement sur les immunités consulaires</i> comprising
twenty-one articles. See Annuaire, XV. p. 304.</p></div>
<p>(1) A distinction is very often made between professional
and non-professional consuls in so far as the
former are accorded more privileges than the latter.</p>
<p>(2) Although consuls are not exempt from the local
civil and criminal jurisdiction, the latter is in regard to
professional consuls often limited to crimes of a more
serious character.</p>
<p>(3) In many treaties it is stipulated that consular
archives shall be inviolable from search or seizure.
Consuls are therefore obliged to keep their official
documents and correspondence separate from their
private papers.</p>
<p>(4) Inviolability of the consular buildings is also
sometimes stipulated, so that no officer of the local
police, Courts, and so on, can enter these buildings
without special permission of the consul. But it is
then the duty of consuls to surrender criminals who
have taken refuge in these buildings.</p>
<p>(5) Professional consuls are often exempt from all
kinds of rates and taxes, from the liability to have
soldiers quartered in their houses, and from the duty
to appear in person as witnesses before the Courts. In
the latter case consuls have either to send in their
evidence in writing, or their evidence may be taken
by a commission on the premises of the consulate.</p>
<p>(6) Consuls of all kinds have the right to put up
the arms of the appointing State over the door of the
consular building and to hoist the national flag.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Undoubted Causes of Termination.</p></div>
<p>§ 436. <a id="De436"></a>Death of the consul, withdrawal of the <i>exequatur</i>,
recall or dismissal, and, lastly, war between the
appointing and the admitting State, are universally
recognised causes of termination of the consular office.
When a consul dies or war breaks out, the consular
archives must not be touched by the local authorities.
They remain either under the care of an <i>employé</i> of the
consulate, or a consul of another State takes charge of
them until the successor of the deceased arrives or
peace is concluded.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Doubtful Causes of Termination.</p></div>
<p>§ 437. It is not certain in practice whether the office
of a consul terminates when his district, through cession,
conquest followed by annexation, or revolt, becomes
the property of another State. The question ought to
be answered in the affirmative, because the <i>exequatur</i>
given to such consul originates from a Government
which then no longer possesses the territory. A practical
instance of this question occurred in 1836, when
Belgium, which was then not yet recognised by Russia,
declared that she would henceforth no longer treat the
Russian consul Aegi at Antwerp as consul, because he
was appointed before the revolt and had his <i>exequatur</i>
granted by the Government of the Netherlands. Although
Belgium gave way in the end to the urgent
remonstrances of Russia, her original attitude was
legally correct.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Change in the Headship of States not Cause of Termination.</p></div>
<p>§ 438. <a id="It_is_universally438"></a>It is universally recognised that, in contradistinction

does not come to an end through a change in the headship
of the appointing or the admitting State. Neither<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</a></span>
a new patent nor a new <i>exequatur</i> is therefore necessary
whether another king comes to the throne or a monarchy
turns into a republic, or in any like case.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Position of Consuls in non-Christian States.</p></div>
<p>§ 439. Fundamentally different from the regular
position is that of consuls in non-Christian States, with
the single exception of Japan. In the Christian countries
of the West alone consuls have, as has been stated
before (§ 418), lost jurisdiction over the subjects of the
appointing States. In the Mohammedan States consuls
not only retained their original jurisdiction, but the
latter became by-and-by so extended through the so-called
Capitulations that the competence of consuls
soon comprised the whole civil and criminal jurisdiction,
the power of protection of the privileges, the life, and
property of their countrymen, and even the power to
expel one of their countrymen for bad conduct. And
custom and treaties secured to consuls inviolability,
exterritoriality, ceremonial honours, and miscellaneous
other rights, so that there is no doubt that their position<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span>
is materially the same as that of diplomatic envoys.
From the Mohammedan countries this position of consuls
has been extended and transferred to China, Japan,
Persia, and other non-Christian countries, but in Japan
the position of consuls shrank in 1899 into that of
consuls in Christian States.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Consular Jurisdiction in non-Christian States.</p></div>
<p>§ 440. <a id="International_custom_and440"></a>International custom and treaties lay down
the rule only that all the subjects of Christian States
residing in non-Christian States shall remain under the
jurisdiction of the home State as exercised by their
consuls.<a id="FNanchor_782_782"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_782_782">[782]</a> It is a matter for the Municipal Laws of
the several Christian States to organise this consular
jurisdiction. All States have therefore enacted statutes
dealing with this matter. As regards Great Britain,
several Orders in Council and the Foreign Jurisdiction
Act (53 &amp; 54 Vict., c. 37) of 1890 are now the legal basis
of the consular jurisdiction.<a id="FNanchor_783_783"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_783_783">[783]</a> The working of this
consular jurisdiction is, however, not satisfactory in
regard to the so-called mixed cases. As the national
consul has exclusive jurisdiction over the subjects of
his home State, he exercises this jurisdiction also in
cases in which the plaintiff is a native or a subject of
another Christian State, and which are therefore called
mixed cases.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>International Courts in Egypt.</p></div>
<p>§ 441. To overcome in some points the disadvantages
of the consular jurisdiction, an interesting experiment
is being made in Egypt. On the initiative of the
Khedive, most of the Powers in 1875 agreed upon an
organisation of International Courts in Egypt for mixed
cases.<a id="FNanchor_784_784"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_784_784">[784]</a> These Courts began their functions in 1876.
They are in the main competent for mixed civil cases,
mixed criminal cases of importance remaining under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span>
the jurisdiction of the national consuls. There are three
International Courts of first instance—namely, at
Alexandria, Cairo, and Ismailia (formerly at Zagazig),
and one International Court of Appeal at Alexandria.
The tribunals of first instance are each composed of
three natives and four foreigners, the Court of Appeal
is composed of four natives and seven foreigners.</p>

<p>§ 442. There is no doubt that the present position
of consuls in non-Christian States is in every point an
exceptional one, which does not agree with the principles
of International Law otherwise universally recognised.
But the position is and must remain a necessity
as long as the civilisation of non-Christian States has
not developed their ideas of justice in accordance with
Christian ideas, so as to preserve the life, property,
and honour of foreigners before native Courts. The
case of Japan is an example of the readiness of the
Powers to consent to the withdrawal of consular
jurisdiction in non-Christian States as soon as they
have reached a certain level of civilisation.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Armed Forces State Organs.</p></div>
<p>§ 443. Armed forces are organs of the State which
maintains them, because such forces are created for the
purpose of maintaining the independence, authority,
and safety of the State. And in this respect it matters
not whether armed forces are at home or abroad, for
they are organs of their home State even when on foreign
territory, provided only they are there in the service
of their State and not for their own purposes. For if
a body of armed soldiers enters foreign territory without
orders from, or without being otherwise in the service
of, its State, but on its own account, be it for pleasure
or for the purpose of committing acts of violence, it is
no longer an organ of its State.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Occasions for Armed Forces abroad.</p></div>
<p>§ 444. Besides war, there are several occasions for
armed forces to be on foreign territory in the service
of their home State. Thus, a State may have a right
to keep troops in a foreign fortress or to send troops
through foreign territory. Thus, further, a State which
has been victorious in war with another may, after the
conclusion of peace, occupy a part of the territory of
its former opponent as a guarantee for the execution
of the Treaty of Peace. After the Franco-German war,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span>
for example, the Germans in 1871 occupied a part of
the territory of France until the final instalments of the
indemnity for the war costs of five milliards of francs
were paid. It may also be a case of necessity for the
armed forces of a State to enter foreign territory and
commit acts of violence there, such as the British did
in the case of the <i>Caroline</i>.<a id="FNanchor_785_785"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_785_785">[785]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_785_785"></a><a href="#FNanchor_785_785" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[785]</span></a> See

<div class="sidenote"><p>Position of Armed Forces abroad.</p></div>
<p>§ 445. <a id="Wh445"></a>Whenever armed forces are on foreign territory
in the service of their home State, they are considered
exterritorial and remain, therefore, under the
jurisdiction of the latter. A crime committed on foreign
territory by a member of the force cannot be punished
by the local civil or military authorities, but only
by the commanding officer of the forces or by other
authorities of its home State.<a id="FNanchor_786_786"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_786_786">[786]</a> This is, however, valid
only in case the crime is committed either within
the place where the force is stationed, or anywhere else
where the criminal was on duty. If, for example,
soldiers belonging to a foreign garrison of a fortress
leave the <i>rayon</i> of the latter, not on duty but for recreation
and pleasure, and then and there commit a crime,
the local authorities are competent to punish them.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_786_786"></a><a href="#FNanchor_786_786" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[786]</span></a> This is nowadays the opinion of the vast majority of
writers on International Law. There are, however, still a few dissenting
authorities, such as Bar ("Lehrbuch des internationalen Privat- und
Strafrecht" (1892), p. 351), and Rivier (I. p. 333).</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Case of McLeod.</p></div>
<p>§ 446. <a id="An_excellent_example446"></a>An excellent example of the position of armed
forces abroad is furnished by the case of McLeod,<a id="FNanchor_787_787"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_787_787">[787]</a>
which occurred in 1841. Alexander McLeod, who was
a member of the British force sent by the Canadian
Government in 1837 into the territory of the United
States for the purpose of capturing the <i>Caroline</i>, a boat
equipped for crossing into Canadian territory and
taking help to the Canadian insurgents, came in 1841
on business to the State of New York, and was arrested
and indicted for the killing of one Amos Durfee, a citizen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span>
of the United States, on the occasion of the capture of
the <i>Caroline</i>. The English Ambassador at Washington
demanded the release of McLeod, on the ground that
he was at the time of the alleged crime a member of a
British armed force sent into the territory of the United
States by the Canadian Government acting in a case
of necessity. McLeod was not released, but had to
take his trial; he was, however, acquitted on proof of
an alibi. It is of importance to quote a passage in the
reply of Mr. Webster, the Secretary of Foreign Affairs
of the United States, to a note of the British Ambassador
concerning this affair. The passage runs thus:—"The
Government of the United States entertains no
doubt that, after the avowal of the transaction as a
public transaction, authorised and undertaken by the
British authorities, individuals concerned in it ought
not ... to be holden personally responsible in the
ordinary tribunals for their participation in it."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>The Casa Blanca Incident.</p></div>
<p>§ 446<i>a</i>. <a id="Another_interesting446a"></a>Another interesting example is the Casa
Blanca incident. On September 25, 1908, six soldiers—three
of them Germans—belonging to the French
Foreign Legion which formed part of the French troops
at Morocco, deserted at Casa Blanca and asked for and
obtained the protection of the local German consul,
who intended to take them on board a German vessel
lying in the harbour of Casa Blanca. On their way to
the ship, however, they were forcibly taken by the
French out of the custody of the secretary of the German
Consulate and a native soldier in the service of the
consulate who were conducting them. Considering all
Germans in Morocco without exception exterritorial
and under the exclusive jurisdiction of her consul,
Germany complained of this act of force and demanded
that those of the deserters concerned who were German
subjects should be given up to her by France, acknowledging
the fact that the consul had no right to extend<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</a></span>
his protection to other than German subjects. France
refused to concede this demand, maintaining that the
individuals concerned had even after their desertion
remained under the exclusive jurisdiction of their corps,
which formed part of a French force occupying foreign
territory. As the parties could not settle the conflict
diplomatically, they agreed, on November 24, 1908, to
bring it before the Hague Court of Arbitration, which
gave its award<a id="FNanchor_788_788"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_788_788">[788]</a> on May 22, 1909, on the whole in favour
of France. The Court considered: that there was a
conflict of jurisdiction with regard to the German deserters
because they were as German subjects under the
exclusive jurisdiction of the German Consulate, but as
deserters from the French Foreign Legion under the
exclusive jurisdiction of the French Army of Occupation;
that under the circumstances of the case the
jurisdiction of the Army of Occupation should have
the preference; that nevertheless the German consul
was not to be blamed for his action on account of the
fact that in a country granting exterritorial jurisdiction
to foreigners the question of the respective competency
of the consular jurisdiction and of the jurisdiction of
an Army of Occupation was very complicated and had
never been settled in an express, distinct, and universally
recognised manner; that, since the German
deserters were found at the port under the actual protection
of the German Consulate and this protection
was not manifestly illegal, the actual situation should,
as far as possible, have been respected by the French
military authority; that therefore the French military
authorities ought to have confined themselves to preventing
the embarkation and escape of the deserters,
and, before proceeding to their arrest and imprisonment,
to have offered to leave them in sequestration of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</a></span>
German Consulate until the question of the competent
jurisdiction had been decided. The Court did not,
however, decree the restitution on the part of France
of the three German deserters to Germany.<a id="FNanchor_789_789"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_789_789">[789]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_788_788"></a><a href="#FNanchor_788_788" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[788]</span></a> See
 Martens, N.R.G. 3rd Ser. II. (1910), p. 19. An English
translation of the Award is printed in A.J. III. (1909), p. 755.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_789_789"></a><a href="#FNanchor_789_789" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[789]</span></a> The ambiguity of the award has justly been severely
criticised. If, as the Court correctly asserts, the jurisdiction of an
Army of Occupation must prevail over the jurisdiction of a consul over
his nationals in a country granting exterritorial jurisdiction, a
decision of the conflict on mere legal grounds would have to be entirely
in favour of France, for it is difficult to see how a wrongfully
acquired and illegally asserted protection can create any obligation on
the part of those who are exclusively competent to exercise
jurisdiction. But it is a well-known fact that Courts of Arbitration
frequently endeavour to give an award which satisfies both parties and
the ambiguity of the award in the Casa Blanca incident is manifestly due
to this fact. The award is not of such a kind as one would expect from a
Court of Justice, although it may be an excellent specimen of an
arbitral decision. See A.J. III. (1909), pp. 698-701.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Men-of-war State Organs.</p></div>
<p>§ 447. <a id="Men-of-war_are_State_organs447"></a>Men-of-war are State organs just as armed
forces are, a man-of-war being in fact a part of the
armed forces of a State. And respecting their character
as State organs, it matters nought whether men-of-war
are at home or in foreign territorial waters or on
the High Seas. But it must be emphasised that men-of-war
are State organs only as long as they are manned
and under the command of a responsible officer, and,
further, as long as they are in the service of a State.
A shipwrecked man-of-war abandoned by her crew is
no longer a State organ, nor does a man-of-war in revolt
against her State and sailing for her own purposes
retain her character as an organ of a State. On the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</a></span>
other hand, public vessels in the service of the police
and the Custom House of a State; further, private
vessels chartered by a State for the transport of troops
and war materials; and, lastly, vessels carrying a head
of a State and his suite exclusively, are also considered
State organs, and are, consequently, in every point
treated as though they were men-of-war.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Proof of Character as Men-of-war.</p></div>
<p>§ 448. The character of a man-of-war or of any
other vessel treated as a man-of-war is, in the first
instance, proved by their outward appearance, such
vessels flying the war flag and the pennant of their
State.<a id="FNanchor_790_790"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_790_790">[790]</a> If, nevertheless, the character of the vessel
seems doubtful, her commission, duly signed by the
authorities of the State which she appears to represent,
supplies a complete proof of her character as a
man-of-war. And it is by no means necessary to prove
that the vessel is really the property of the State, the
commission being sufficient evidence of her character.
Vessels chartered by a State for the transport of troops
or for the purpose of carrying its head are indeed not
the property of such State, although they bear, by
virtue of their commission, the same character as men-of-war.<a id="FNanchor_791_791"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_791_791">[791]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_790_790"></a><a href="#FNanchor_790_790" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[790]</span></a> Attention ought to be drawn here to Convention VII.
(concerning the conversion of merchant-ships into war-ships) of the
second Hague Peace Conference of 1907. Although this convention concerns
the time of war only, it is indirectly of importance for the time of
peace. Its stipulations are the following:—No merchant-ship converted
into a war-ship can have the rights and duties appertaining to that
status unless it is placed under the direct authority, immediate
control, and responsibility of the Power whose flag it flies (art. 1).
Merchant-ships converted into war-ships must bear the external marks
which distinguish the war-ships of their nationality (art. 2). The
commander must be in the service of the State and duly commissioned by
the proper authorities. His name must figure on the list of the officers
of the military fleet (art. 3). The crew must be subject to the rules of
military discipline (art. 4). Every merchant-ship converted into a
war-ship is bound to observe, in its operations, the laws and customs of
war (art. 5). A belligerent who converts a merchant-ship into a war-ship
must, as soon as possible, announce such conversion in the list of the
ships of its military fleet (art. 6).</p></div>

<p>§ 449. <a id="Whereas_armed_forces449"></a>Whereas armed forces in time of peace have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span>
no occasion to be abroad, cases of a special right from
a convention and cases of necessity excepted, men-of-war
of all maritime States possessing a navy are constantly
crossing the High Seas in all parts of the world
for all kinds of purposes. Occasions for men-of-war
to sail through foreign territorial waters and to enter
foreign ports necessarily arise therefrom. And a special
convention between the flag-State and the littoral State
is not necessary to enable a man-of-war to enter and
sail through foreign territorial waters and to enter a
foreign port. All territorial waters and ports of the
civilised States are, as a rule, quite as much open to
men-of-war as to merchantmen of all nations, provided
they are not excluded by special international stipulations
or special Municipal Laws of the littoral States.
On the other hand, it must be emphasised that, provided
special international stipulations or special treaties
between the flag-State and the littoral State do not
prescribe the contrary in regard to one port or another
and in regard to certain territorial waters, a State is
in strict law always competent to exclude men-of-war
from all or certain of its ports, and from those territorial
waters which do not serve as highways for international
traffic.<a id="FNanchor_792_792"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_792_792">[792]</a> And a State is, further, always competent
to impose what conditions it thinks necessary
upon men-of-war which it allows to enter its ports, provided
these conditions do not deny to men-of-war their
universally recognised privileges.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_792_792"></a><a href="#FNanchor_792_792" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[792]</span></a> The matter is controversial. See
 above, § <a href="#Although_the_maritime188" class="pginternal">188</a>, and
Westlake, I. p. 192, in contradistinction to Hall, § 42.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Position of Men-of-war in foreign waters.</p></div>
<p>§ 450. <a id="Th450"></a>The position of men-of-war in foreign waters
is characterised by the fact that they are called "floating"
portions of the flag-State. For at the present
time a customary rule of International Law is universally
recognised that the owner State of the waters into
which foreign men-of-war enter must treat them in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span>
every point as though they were floating portions of
their flag-State.<a id="FNanchor_793_793"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_793_793">[793]</a> Consequently, a man-of-war, with all
persons and goods on board, remains under the jurisdiction
of her flag-State even during her stay in foreign
waters. No official of the littoral State is allowed to
board the vessel without special permission of the
commander. Crimes committed on board by persons
in the service of the vessel are under the exclusive jurisdiction
of the commander and the other home authorities.
Individuals who are subjects of the littoral State
and are only temporarily on board may, although they
need not, be taken to the home country of the vessel,
to be there punished if they commit a crime on board.
Even individuals who do not belong to the crew, and
who after having committed a crime on the territory
of the littoral State have taken refuge on board, cannot
be forcibly taken off the vessel; if the commander
refuses their surrender, it can be obtained only by
means of diplomacy from the home State.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_793_793"></a><a href="#FNanchor_793_793" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[793]</span></a> This rule became universally recognised during the
nineteenth century only. On the change of doctrines formerly held in
this country and the United States of America, see Hall, § 54, and
Lawrence, § 107. English and American Courts now recognise the
exterritoriality of foreign public vessels. Thus, in the case of the
<i>Exchange</i> (7 Cranch, 116), the Supreme Court of the United States
recognised the fact that the latter had no jurisdiction over this French
man-of-war. In the case of the <i>Constitution</i>, an American man-of-war,
the High Court of Admiralty in 1879 held that foreign public ships
cannot be sued in English Courts for salvage (L.R. 4 P.D. 39). And in
the case of the <i>Parlement Belge</i> (L.R. 5 P.D. 197) the Court of Appeal,
affirmed by the House of Lords in 1878, held that foreign public vessels
cannot be sued in English Courts for damages for collision. Again the
same was held in 1906 in the case of the <i>Jassy</i>, a Roumanian ship, 10
Aspinall, Mar. Cas. p. 278. See also the <i>Charkieh</i> (1873), L.R. 4 Adm.
and Eccl. 59.</p></div>
<p>On the other hand, men-of-war cannot do what they
like in foreign waters. They are expected voluntarily
to comply with the laws of the littoral States with
regard to order in the ports, the places for casting
anchor, sanitation and quarantine, customs, and the
like. A man-of-war which refuses to do so can be expelled,
and, if on such or other occasions she commits<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span>
acts of violence against the officials of the littoral State
or against other vessels, steps may be taken against her
to prevent further acts of violence. But it must be
emphasised that even by committing acts of violence a
man-of-war does not fall under the jurisdiction of the
littoral State. Only such measures are allowed against
her as are necessary to prevent her from further acts
of violence.<a id="FNanchor_794_794"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_794_794">[794]</a></p>

its meeting at the Hague of which articles 8-24 deal with men-of-war in
foreign waters; see Annuaire, XVII. (1898), pp. 275-280.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Position of Crew when on Land abroad.</p></div>
<p>§ 451. Of some importance is the unsettled question
respecting the position of the commander and the crew
of a man-of-war in foreign ports when they are on land.</p>
<p>The majority of publicists distinguish between a
stay on land in the service of the man-of-war and a
stay for other purposes.<a id="FNanchor_795_795"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_795_795">[795]</a> The commander and members
of the crew on land officially in the service of their
vessel, to buy provisions or to make other arrangements
respecting the vessel, remain under the exclusive jurisdiction
of their home State, even for crimes they commit
on the spot. Although they may, if the case makes it
necessary, be arrested to prevent further violence, they
must at once be surrendered to the vessel. On the
other hand, if they are on land not officially, but for
purposes of pleasure and recreation, they are under the
territorial supremacy of the littoral State like any other
foreigners, and they may be punished for crimes committed
ashore.</p>

<p>§ 452. Besides diplomatic envoys and consuls, States
may and do send various kinds of agents abroad—namely,
public political agents, secret political agents,
spies, commissaries, bearers of despatches. Their position
is not the same, but varies according to the class
they belong to, and they must therefore be severally
treated.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Public Political Agents.</p></div>
<p>§ 453. Public political agents are agents sent by one
Power to another for political negotiations of different
kinds. They may be sent for a permanency or for a
limited time only. As they are not invested with diplomatic
character, they do not receive a Letter of Credence,
but a letter of recommendation or commission only.
They may be sent by one full-Sovereign State to another,
but also by and to insurgents recognised as a
belligerent Power, and by and to States under suzerainty.
Public (or secret) political agents without diplomatic
character are, in fact, the only means for personal political
negotiations with such insurgents and States under
suzerainty.</p>
<p>As regards the position and privileges of such agents,
it is obvious that they enjoy neither the position nor
the privileges of diplomatic envoys.<a id="FNanchor_797_797"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_797_797">[797]</a> But, on the other
hand, they have a public character, being admitted as

therefore, certainly be granted a special protection, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</a></span>
no distinct rules concerning special privileges to be

<div class="sidenote"><p>Secret Political Agents.</p></div>
<p>§ 454. Secret political agents may be sent for the
same purposes as public political agents. But two
kinds of secret political agents must be distinguished.
An agent may be secretly sent to another Power with
a letter of recommendation and admitted by that
Power. Such agent is a secret one in so far as third
Powers do not know, or are not supposed to know, of
his existence. As he is, although secretly, admitted
by the receiving State, his position is essentially the
same as that of a public political agent. On the other
hand, an agent may be secretly sent abroad for political
purposes without a letter of recommendation, and
therefore without being formally admitted by the
Government of the State in which he is fulfilling his
task. Such agent has no recognised position whatever
according to International Law. He is not an agent
of a State for its relations with other States, and he is
therefore in the same position as any other foreign individual
living within the boundaries of a State. He
may be expelled at any moment if he becomes troublesome,
and he may be criminally punished if he commits
a political or ordinary crime. Such secret agents are
often abroad for the purpose of watching the movements
of political refugees or partisans, or of Socialists, Anarchists,
Nihilists, and the like. As long as such agents
do not turn into so-called <i>agents provocateurs</i>, the local
authorities will not interfere.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Spies.</p></div>
<p>§ 455. Spies are secret agents of a State sent abroad<a id="FNanchor_799_799"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_799_799">[799]</a>
for the purpose of obtaining clandestinely information<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</a></span>
in regard to military or political secrets. Although all
States constantly or occasionally send spies abroad, and
although it is neither morally nor politically and legally
considered wrong to send spies, such agents have, of
course, no recognised position whatever according to
International Law, since they are not agents of States
for their international relations. Every State punishes
them severely when they are caught committing an act
which is a crime by the law of the land, or expels them
if they cannot be punished. And a spy cannot legally
excuse himself by pleading that he only executed the
orders of his Government. The latter, on the other
hand, will never interfere, since it cannot officially
confess to having commissioned a spy.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_799_799"></a><a href="#FNanchor_799_799" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[799]</span></a> Concerning spies in time of war, see

<div class="sidenote"><p>Commissaries.</p></div>
<p>§ 456. Commissaries are agents sent with a letter
of recommendation or commission by one State to another
for negotiations, not of a political but of a technical
or administrative character only. Such commissaries
are, for instance, sent and received for the purpose
of arrangements between the two States as regards railways,
post, telegraphs, navigation, delineation of boundary
lines, and so on. A distinct practice of guaranteeing
certain privileges to such commissaries has not
grown up, but inviolability of their persons and official
papers ought to be granted to them, as they are officially
sent and received for official purposes. Thus Germany,
in 1887, in the case of the French officer of police Schnaebélé,
who was invited by local German functionaries to
cross the German frontier for official purposes and then
arrested, recognised the rule that a safe-conduct is
tacitly granted to foreign officials when they enter
officially the territory of a State with the consent of
the local authorities, although Schnaebélé was not a
commissary sent by his Government to the German
Government.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Bearers of Despatches.</p></div>
<p>§ 457. <a id="In457"></a>Individuals commissioned to carry official<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></span>
despatches from a State to its head or to diplomatic
envoys abroad are agents of such State. Despatch-bearers
who belong to the retinue of diplomatic envoys
as their couriers must enjoy, as stated above (§ 405),
exemption from civil and criminal jurisdiction and a
special protection in the State to which the envoy is
accredited, and a right of innocent passage through
third States. But bearers of official despatches who
are not in the retinue of the diplomatic envoys employing
them must nevertheless be granted inviolability for
their person and official papers, provided they possess
special passports stating their official character as
despatch-bearers. And the same is valid respecting
bearers of despatches between the head of a State who
is temporarily abroad and his Government at home.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Permanent in Contradistinction to Temporary Commissions.</p></div>
<p>§ 458. A distinction must be made between temporary
and permanent international commissions. The
former consist of commissaries delegated by two or more
States to arrange all kinds of non-political matters,
such as railways, post, telegraphs, navigation, boundary
lines, and the like. Such temporary commissions dissolve
as soon as their purpose is realised.<a id="FNanchor_800_800"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_800_800">[800]</a> Besides
temporary commissions, there are, however, permanent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</a></span>
commissions in existence. They have been instituted
by the Powers<a id="FNanchor_801_801"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_801_801">[801]</a> in the interest of free navigation on two
international rivers and the Suez Canal; further, in
the interest of international sanitation; thirdly, in the
interest of the foreign creditors of several States unable
to pay the interest on their stocks; and, lastly, concerning
bounties on sugar.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_800_800"></a><a href="#FNanchor_800_800" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[800]</span></a> The position of their members has been discussed above, §
456. Quite novel institutions are the International Commissions of
Inquiry recommended by the Hague Peace Conferences of 1890 and 1907.
Articles 9 to 36 of the Hague Convention for the peaceful adjustment of
international differences provide that, in international differences
involving neither honour nor vital interests, and arising from a
difference of opinion on matters of fact, the parties should institute
an International Commission of Inquiry; this commission to present a
report to the parties, which shall be limited to a statement of the
facts. See
 below, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41047/41047-h/41047-h.htm#Th5" class="pgexternal" id="id-7591679174357181529">vol. II. § 5</a>.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_801_801"></a><a href="#FNanchor_801_801" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[801]</span></a> Only such permanent commissions are mentioned in the text
as have been instituted by the Powers in conference. There are, however,
many permanent commissions in existence which have been instituted by
neighbouring Powers for local purposes, as for example:—(1) The
American-Canadian International Fisheries Commission, instituted
according to article 1 of the Treaty of Washington of April 11, 1908;
see Treaty Series, 1908, No. 17. (2) The American-Canadian International
Joint Commission concerning boundary waters, instituted by articles 7-12
of the Treaty of Washington of January 11, 1909; see Treaty Series,
1910, No. 23. (3) The permanent Mixed Fisheries Commission between the
United States, Canada, and Newfoundland, instituted in consequence of
the award of the Hague Court of Arbitration in the North Atlantic
Fisheries Case.</p></div>
<p>As regards the privileges to be granted to the members
of either temporary or permanent international
commissions, no distinct practice has grown up. If the
treaty according to which a commission concerned does
not stipulate anything as regards such privileges, none
need be granted, but the persons of the commissioners
must be specially protected. However that may be,
there is no doubt that members of international commissions
cannot, unless this be specially stipulated,
claim the privileges of diplomatic envoys. Thus, when
in 1796 Messrs. Gore and Pinkney,<a id="FNanchor_802_802"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_802_802">[802]</a> the American Commissioners
in London under article 7 of the Jay Treaty,
claimed these privileges, Great Britain refused to
concede them.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Commissions in the interest of Navigation.</p></div>
<p>§ 459. Four international commissions have been

<p>1. With regard to navigation on the Danube,
the European Danube Commission was instituted by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</a></span>
article 16 of the Peace Treaty of Paris in 1856. This
commission, whose members are appointed by the
signatory Powers of the Treaty of Paris, was reconstituted
by the Berlin Conference in 1878 and again by
the Conference of London in 1883. The commission
is totally independent of the territorial Governments,
its rights are clearly defined, and its members, offices,
and archives enjoy the privilege of inviolability. The
competence of the European Danube Commission comprehends
the Danube from Ibraila downwards to its

<p>3. The Powers represented at the Berlin Congo
Conference of 1884 have sanctioned certain regulations
in regard to navigation on the Congo river, and have,
by articles 17-21 of the General Act of the Conference,
instituted an International Commission of the Congo
to enforce the observance of these regulations. This
Commission, in which every signatory Power may be
represented by one member, is totally independent of
the territorial Governments, and its members, offices,

into by a greater or lesser number of States for the purpose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</a></span>
of settling in common certain non-political matters.
These general treaties create so-called unions among the
parties, and the business of these unions is in most cases
transacted by international offices created specially for
that purpose. The functionaries of these offices, however,
ordinarily enjoy no privilege whatever. The number
of these offices is constantly increasing. Only the more

<p>§ 472. <a id="In472"></a>In compliance with articles 20 to 29 of the
Hague Convention for the peaceful adjustment of international
differences, the signatory Powers in 1900
organised the International Court of Arbitration at
the Hague. This organisation comprises three distinct
bodies—namely, the Permanent Administrative Council
of the Court, the International Bureau of the Court,
and the Court of Arbitration itself. But a fourth body
must also be distinguished—namely, the tribunal to be
constituted for the decision of every case. Articles 20
to 29 are now replaced by articles 41 to 50 of the Convention
for the peaceful adjustment of international
differences produced by the second Hague Peace Conference
of 1907.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>The Permanent Council.</p></div>
<p>§ 473. The Permanent Council (article 49) consists
of the diplomatic envoys of the contracting Powers
accredited to Holland and the Dutch Secretary for
Foreign Affairs, who acts as president of the Council.
The task of the Council is the control of the International<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</a></span>
Bureau of the Court, the appointment, suspension,
and dismissal of the <i>employés</i> of the bureau,
the fixing of the payments and salaries, the control of
the general expenditure, and the decision of all questions
of administration with regard to the business of
the Court. The Council has, further, the task of furnishing
the signatory Powers with a report of the proceedings
of the Court, the working of the administration,
and the expenses. At meetings duly summoned, the
presence of nine members is sufficient to give the Council
power to deliberate, and its decisions are taken by a
majority of votes.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>The International Bureau.</p></div>
<p>§ 474. <a id="The_International_Bureau474"></a>The International Bureau (article 43) serves
as the Registry for the Court. It is the intermediary
for communications relating to the meetings of the
Court. It has the custody of the archives and the
conduct of all the administrative business of the Court.
The contracting Powers have to furnish the Bureau
with a certified copy of every stipulation concerning
arbitration arrived at between them, and of any award
concerning them rendered by a special tribunal. They
likewise have to communicate to the Bureau the laws,
regulations, and documents, if any, showing the execution
of the awards given by the Court. The Bureau is
(article 47) authorised to place its premises and its staff
at the disposal of the contracting Powers for the work
of any special<a id="FNanchor_826_826"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_826_826">[826]</a> tribunal of arbitration not constituted
within the International Court of Arbitration. The
expense (article 50) of the Bureau is borne by the
signatory Powers in the proportion established for the
International Office of the International Postal Union.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>The Court of Arbitration.</p></div>
<p>§ 475. The Court of Arbitration (article 44) consists
of a large number of individuals "of recognised competence
in questions of International Law, enjoying the
highest moral reputation," selected and appointed by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</a></span>
the contracting Powers. No more than four members
may be appointed by one Power, but two or more
Powers may unite in the appointment of one or more
members, and the same individual may be appointed
by different Powers. Every member is appointed for
a term of six years, but his appointment may be renewed.
The place of a resigned or deceased member
is to be refilled by the respective Powers, and in this
case the appointment is made for a fresh period of six
years. The names of the members of the Court thus
appointed are enrolled upon a general list, which is to
be kept up to date and communicated to all the contracting
Powers. The Court thus constituted has
jurisdiction over all cases of arbitration, unless there
shall be an agreement between the parties for a special
tribunal of arbitrators not selected from the list of the
members of the Court (article 42).</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>The Deciding Tribunal.</p></div>
<p>§ 476. <a id="Th476"></a>The Court of Arbitration does not as a body
decide the cases brought before it, but a tribunal is
created for every special case by selection of a number
of arbitrators from the list of the members of the Court.
This tribunal (article 45) may be created directly by
agreement of the parties. If this is not done, the
tribunal is formed in the following manner:—Each party
selects two arbitrators from the list, of whom one only
can be its national or chosen from the persons appointed
by it as members of the Permanent Court, and the four
arbitrators so appointed choose a fifth as umpire and
president. If the votes of the four are equal, the
parties entrust to a third Power the choice of the umpire.
If the parties cannot agree in their choice of such third
Power, each party nominates a different Power, and the
umpire is chosen by the united action of the Powers
thus nominated. If within two months' time these two
Powers cannot come to an agreement, each of them
presents two candidates from the list of members of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</a></span>
the Permanent Court, exclusive of the members selected
by the parties and not being nationals of either of them.
Which of the candidates thus selected shall be the
umpire is determined by lot.</p>
<p>After this is done, the tribunal is constituted, and
the parties communicate to the International Bureau
of the Court the names of the members of the tribunal,
which meets at the time fixed by the parties; the
members of the tribunal must be granted the privileges
of diplomatic envoys when discharging their duties
outside their own country (article 46). The tribunal
sits at the Hague (article 43), and, except in case of
<i>force majeure</i>, the place of session can only be altered
by the tribunal with the assent of the parties, but the
parties can from the beginning designate another place
than the Hague as the venue of the tribunal (article 60).
The expenses of the tribunal are paid by the parties in
equal shares, and each party pays its own expenses
(article 85).<a id="FNanchor_827_827"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_827_827">[827]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>The International Prize Court.</p></div>
<p>§ 476<i>a</i>. <a id="The_International_Prize476a"></a>The International Prize Court will be established
at the Hague according to Convention XII. of
the second Hague Peace Conference of 1907. The following
are the more important stipulations of this
Convention concerning the constitution<a id="FNanchor_828_828"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_828_828">[828]</a> of the Court:—The
Court consists of fifteen judges and fifteen deputy-judges,
who are appointed for a period of six years and
who rank equally and have precedence according to
the date of the notification of their appointment, but
the deputy judges rank after the judges (articles 10 to
12). Of the fifteen judges of which the Court is composed,
nine constitute a quorum; a judge who is absent
or prevented from sitting is replaced by his deputy judge
(article 14). The judges enjoy diplomatic privileges
and immunities in the performance of their duties<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_523">[Pg 523]</a></span>
when outside their own country (article 13). Each
contracting Power appoints one judge and one deputy
judge, and the judges appointed by Great Britain,
Germany, the United States of America, Austria-Hungary,
France, Italy, Japan, and Russia are always
summoned to sit, whereas the judges appointed by the
other contracting Powers sit by rota, as shown in the
table annexed to the Convention (article 15). If a
belligerent Power has, according to the rota, no judge
sitting in the Court, it may ask that the judge appointed
by it shall take part in the settlement of all cases arising
from the war; lots shall then be drawn as to which of
the judges entitled to sit according to the rota shall
withdraw, and this arrangement does not affect the
judge appointed by the other belligerent (article 16).
No judge can sit who has been a party, in any way
whatever, to the sentence pronounced by the National
Courts, or has taken part in the case as counsel or
advocate for one of the parties; no judge or deputy
judge can, during his tenure of office, appear as agent
or advocate before the International Prize Court, nor
act for one of the parties in any capacity whatever
(article 17). The belligerent captor is entitled to appoint
a naval officer of high rank to sit as assessor, but
with no voice in the decision; a neutral Power, which
is a party to the proceedings or whose national is a
party, has the same right of appointment; if in applying
this last provision more than one Power is concerned,
they must agree among themselves, if necessary
by lot, on the officer to be appointed (article 18). The
Court elects its President and Vice-President by an
absolute majority of the votes cast; after two ballots,
the election is made by a bare majority, and, in case
the votes are equal, by lot (article 19). The judges of
the International Prize Court are entitled to travelling
allowances in accordance with the regulations in force<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</a></span>
in their own country, and in addition thereto receive,
while the Court is sitting or while they are carrying
out duties conferred upon them by the Court, a sum
of 100 Netherland florins per diem; the judges may
not receive from their own Governments or from that
of any other Power any remuneration in their capacity
of members of the Court (article 20). The seat of the
International Prize Court is at the Hague, and it cannot,
except in the case of <i>force majeure</i>, be transferred elsewhere
without the consent of the belligerents (article 21).</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>The proposed International Court of Justice.</p></div>
<p>§ 476<i>b</i>. <a id="Va476b"></a>Valuable as is the Permanent Court of Arbitration
at the Hague, it must be pointed out that it is
not a real Court of Justice. For, firstly, it is not itself
a deciding tribunal, but only a list of names out of
which the parties in each case elect some members
and thereby constitute the Court. Secondly, experience
teaches that a Court of Arbitration endeavours more to
give an award <i>ex aequo et bono</i> which more or less pleases
both parties than to decide the conflict in a judicial
manner by simply applying strict legal rules without
any consideration as to whether or no the decision
will please either party. Thirdly, since in conflicts to
be decided by arbitration the arbitrators each time
are selected by the parties, there are in most cases
different individuals acting as arbitrators, so that there
is no continuity in the administration of justice.</p>
<p>For these reasons it would be of the greatest value
to institute side by side with the Permanent Court of
Arbitration a real International Court of Justice consisting
of a number of judges in the technical sense of
the term, who are once for all appointed and will have
to act in each case that the parties choose to bring
before the Court. Such a Court would only take the
legal aspects of the case into consideration and would
base its decision on mere legal deliberations. It would
secure continuity in the administration of international<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</a></span>
justice, because it would in each case consider itself
bound by its former decisions. It would in time build
up a valuable practice by deciding innumerable controversies
which as yet haunt the theory of International
Law. The second Hague Peace Conference of 1907
therefore discussed the question of creating such a
Court, but only produced the draft of a Convention
concerning the subject. It is, however, to be regretted
that this draft Convention speaks of the creation of a
judicial "Arbitration" Court, and thereby obliterates
the boundary line between the arbitral and the strictly
judicial decision of international disputes; it would
have been better to speak simply of an International
Court of Justice. However that may be, there is no
doubt that the near future will bring the establishment
of such a Court of Justice in contradistinction to the
Permanent Court of Arbitration, for the parties to a
conflict frequently hesitate to have it settled by arbitration,
whereas they would be glad to have it settled
by a strictly judicial decision of the legal questions involved.
The same motives which urged the Powers to
leave aside the Permanent Court of Arbitration in Prize
Cases and to enter into a Convention for the establishment
of a real International Prize Court, will in time
compel the Powers to establish a real International
Court of Justice.<a id="FNanchor_829_829"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_829_829">[829]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_829_829"></a><a href="#FNanchor_829_829" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[829]</span></a> It should be mentioned that Costa Rica, Guatemala,
Honduras, Nicaragua, and San Salvador in 1907—see Supplement to the
<i>American Journal of International Law</i>, II. (1908), p. 231—established
the "Central American Court of Justice" at Cartago, consisting of five
judges, to which they have bound themselves to submit all controversies
arising amongst them, of whatsoever nature, no matter what the origin
may be, in case they cannot be settled by diplomatic negotiation. This
Court is, however, only of local importance, although it is of great
value, being the first Court of its kind.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Conception of Negotiation.</p></div>
<p>§ 477. <a id="In477"></a>International negotiation is the term for such
intercourse between two or more States as is initiated
and directed for the purpose of effecting an understanding
between them on matters of interest. Since
civilised States form a body interknitted through their
interests, such negotiation is in some shape or other
constantly going on. No State of any importance can
abstain from it in practice. There are many other
international transactions,<a id="FNanchor_830_830"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_830_830">[830]</a> but negotiation is by far
the most important of them. And it must be emphasised
that negotiation as a means of amicably settling
conflicts between two or more States is only a particular
kind of negotiation, although it will be specially discussed
in another part of this work.<a id="FNanchor_831_831"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_831_831">[831]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_830_830"></a><a href="#FNanchor_830_830" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[830]</span></a> See

<div class="sidenote"><p>Parties to Negotiation.</p></div>
<p>§ 478. <a id="International_negotiations478"></a>International negotiations can be conducted
by all such States as have a standing within the Family
of Nations. Full-Sovereign States are, therefore, the
regular subjects of international negotiation. But it
would be wrong to maintain that half- and part-Sovereign
States can never be parties to international negotiations.
For they can indeed conduct negotiations on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_530">[Pg 530]</a></span>
those points concerning which they have a standing
within the Family of Nations. Thus, for instance, while
Bulgaria was a half-Sovereign State, she was nevertheless
able to negotiate on several matters with foreign States
independently of Turkey.<a id="FNanchor_832_832"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_832_832">[832]</a> But so-called colonial
States, as the Dominion of Canada, can never be parties
to international negotiations; any necessary negotiation
for a colonial State must be conducted by the
mother-State to which it internationally belongs.<a id="FNanchor_833_833"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_833_833">[833]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_832_832"></a><a href="#FNanchor_832_832" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[832]</span></a> See
 above, § <a href="#Th91" class="pginternal">91</a>.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_833_833"></a><a href="#FNanchor_833_833" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[833]</span></a> The demand on the part of many influential Canadian
politicians, expressed after the verdict of the Arbitration Court in the
Alaska Boundary dispute, that Canada should have the power of making
treaties independently of Great Britain, necessarily includes the demand
to become in some respects a Sovereign State.</p></div>
<p>It must be specially mentioned that such negotiation
as is conducted between a State, on the one hand, and,
on the other, a party which is not a State, is not <i>international</i>
negotiation, although such party may reside
abroad. Thus, negotiations of a State with the Pope
and the Holy See are not international negotiations,
although all the formalities connected with international
negotiations are usually observed in this case. Thus,
too, negotiations on the part of States with a body of
foreign bankers and contractors concerning a loan, the
building of a railway, the working of a mine, and the
like, are not international negotiations.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Purpose of Negotiation.</p></div>
<p>§ 479. Negotiations between States may have various
purposes. The purpose may be an exchange of views
only on some political question; but it may also
be an arrangement as to the line of action to be taken
in future with regard to a certain point, or a settlement
of differences, or the creation of international
institutions, such as the Universal Postal Union for
example, and so on. Of the greatest importance are
those negotiations which aim at an understanding between
members of the Family of Nations respecting the
very creation of rules of International Law by international<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_531">[Pg 531]</a></span>
conventions. Since the Vienna Congress at
the beginning of the nineteenth century negotiations
between the Powers for the purpose of defining, creating,

<div class="sidenote"><p>Negotiations by whom conducted.</p></div>
<p>§ 480. International negotiations are conducted by
the agents which represent the negotiating States.
The heads of these States may conduct the negotiations
in person, either by letters or by a personal interview.
Serious negotiations have in the past been conducted
by heads of States, and, although this is comparatively
seldom done, there is no reason to believe that personal
negotiations between heads of States will not occur in
future.<a id="FNanchor_835_835"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_835_835">[835]</a> Heads of States may also personally negotiate
with diplomatic or other agents commissioned for that
purpose by other States. Ambassadors, as diplomatic
agents of the first class, must, according to International
Law, have even the right to approach in person the head
of the State to which they are accredited for the purpose
of negotiation.<a id="FNanchor_836_836"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_836_836">[836]</a> The rule is, however, that negotiation
between States concerning more important matters is
conducted by their Secretaries for Foreign Affairs, with
the help either of their diplomatic envoys or of agents
without diplomatic character and so-called commissaries.<a id="FNanchor_837_837"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_837_837">[837]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_835_835"></a><a href="#FNanchor_835_835" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[835]</span></a> See

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_837_837"></a><a href="#FNanchor_837_837" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[837]</span></a> Negotiations between armed forces of belligerents are
regularly conducted by soldiers. See
 below, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41047/41047-h/41047-h.htm#Al220" class="pgexternal" id="id-2861610650763236839">vol. II. §§ 220</a>-240.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Form of Negotiation.</p></div>
<p>§ 481. The Law of Nations does not prescribe any
particular form in which international negotiations
must be conducted. Such negotiations may, therefore,
take place <i>viva voce</i> or through the exchange of
written representations and arguments, or both. The
more important negotiations are regularly conducted
through the diplomatic exchange of written communications,
as only in this way can misunderstandings be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_532">[Pg 532]</a></span>
avoided, which easily arise during <i>viva voce</i> negotiations.
Of the greatest importance are the negotiations which
take place through congresses and conferences.<a id="FNanchor_838_838"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_838_838">[838]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_838_838"></a><a href="#FNanchor_838_838" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[838]</span></a> See
 below, § <a href="#International_congresses483" class="pginternal">483</a>.</p></div>
<p>During <i>viva voce</i> negotiations it happens sometimes
that a diplomatic envoy negotiating with the Secretary
for Foreign Affairs reads out a letter received from his
home State. In such case it is usual to leave a copy
of the letter at the Foreign Office. If a copy is refused,
the Secretary for Foreign Affairs can on his part refuse
to hear the letter read. Thus in 1825 Canning refused
to allow a Russian communication to be read to him
by the Russian Ambassador in London with regard to
the independence of the former Spanish colonies in
South America, because this Ambassador was not
authorised to leave a copy of the communication at
the British Foreign Office.<a id="FNanchor_839_839"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_839_839">[839]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_839_839"></a><a href="#FNanchor_839_839" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[839]</span></a> As
 regards the language used during negotiation, see
 above, § <a href="#The_rise_of_permanent359" class="pginternal">359</a>.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>End and Effect of Negotiation.</p></div>
<p>§ 482. Negotiations may and often do come to an
end without any effect whatever on account of the
parties failing to agree. On the other hand, if negotiations
lead to an understanding, the effect may be twofold.
It may consist either in a satisfactory exchange
of views and intentions, and the parties are then in no
way, at any rate not legally, bound to abide by such
views and intentions, or to act on them in the future;
or in an agreement on a treaty, and then the parties
are legally bound by the stipulations of such treaty.
Treaties are of such importance that it is necessary to
discuss them in a special chapter.<a id="FNanchor_840_840"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_840_840">[840]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Conception of Congresses and Conferences.</p></div>
<p>§ 483. <a id="International_congresses483"></a>International congresses and conferences are
formal meetings of the representatives of several States
for the purpose of discussing matters of international
interest and coming to an agreement concerning these
matters. As far as language is concerned, the term
"congress" as well as "conference" may be used for
the meetings of the representatives of only two States,
but as a rule congresses or conferences denote such
bodies only as are composed of the representatives of
a greater number of States. Several writers<a id="FNanchor_841_841"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_841_841">[841]</a> allege
that there are characteristic differences between a congress
and a conference. But all such alleged differences
vanish in face of the fact that the Powers, when summoning
a meeting of representatives, name such body
either congress or conference indiscriminately. It is
not even correct to say that the more important meetings
are named congresses, in contradistinction to conferences,
for the Hague Peace Conferences of 1899 and
1907 were, in spite of their grand importance, denominated
conferences.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_841_841"></a><a href="#FNanchor_841_841" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[841]</span></a> See,
 for instance, Martens, I. § 52; Fiore, II. §§
1216-1224, and Code, No. 1231.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_534">[Pg 534]</a></span></p></div>
<p>Much more important than the mere terminological
difference between congress and conference is the difference
of the representatives who attend the meeting.</p>
<p>For it may be that the heads of the States meet at a
congress or conference, or that the representatives consist
of diplomatic envoys and Secretaries for Foreign
Affairs of the Powers. But, although congresses and
conferences of heads of States have been held in the
past and might at any moment be held again in the
future, there can be no doubt that the most important
matters are treated by congresses and conferences consisting
of diplomatic representatives of the Powers.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Parties to Congresses and Conferences.</p></div>
<p>§ 484. Congresses and conferences not being organised
by customary or conventional International Law,
no rules exist with regard to the parties of a congress or
conference. Everything depends upon the purpose for
which a congress or a conference meets, and upon the
Power which invites other Powers to the meeting. If
it is intended to settle certain differences, it is reasonable
that all the States concerned should be represented, for a
Power which is not represented need not consent to
the resolutions of the congress. If the creation of new
rules of International Law is intended, at least all full-Sovereign
members of the Family of Nations ought to
be represented. To the First Peace Conference at the
Hague, nevertheless, only the majority of States were
invited to send representatives, the South American
Republics not being invited at all. But to the Second
Peace Conference of 1907 forty-seven States were invited,
although only forty-four sent representatives.
Costa Rica, Honduras, and Abyssinia were invited, but
did not send any delegates.</p>
<p>It is frequently maintained that only full-Sovereign
States can be parties to congresses and conferences.
This is certainly not correct, as here, too, everything
depends upon the merits of the special case. As a
rule, full-Sovereign States only are parties, but there
are exceptions. Thus, Bulgaria, at the time a vassal
under Turkish suzerainty, was a party to the First as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_535">[Pg 535]</a></span>
well as to the Second Hague Peace Conference, although
without a vote. There is no reason to deny the rule
that half- and part-Sovereign States can be parties to
congresses and conferences in so far as they are able
to negotiate internationally.<a id="FNanchor_842_842"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_842_842">[842]</a> Such States are, in fact,
frequently asked to send representatives to such congresses
and conferences as meet for non-political matters.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_842_842"></a><a href="#FNanchor_842_842" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[842]</span></a> See
 above, § <a href="#International_negotiations478" class="pginternal">478</a>.</p></div>
<p>But no State can be a party which has not been
invited, or admitted at its own request. If a Power
thinks it fitting that a congress or conference should
meet, it invites such other Powers as it pleases. The
invited Powers may accept under the condition that
certain other Powers should or should not be invited
or admitted. Those Powers which have accepted the
invitation become parties if they send representatives.
Each party may send several representatives, but they
have only one vote, given by the senior representative
for himself and his subordinates.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Procedure at Congresses and Conferences.</p></div>
<p>§ 485. After the place and time of meeting have
been arranged—such place may be neutralised for the
purpose of securing the independence of the deliberations
and discussions—the representatives meet and
constitute themselves by exchanging their commissions
and electing a president and other officers. It is usual,
but not obligatory,<a id="FNanchor_843_843"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_843_843">[843]</a> for the Secretary for Foreign
Affairs of the State within which the congress meets
to be elected president. If the difficulty of the questions
on the programme makes it advisable, special
committees are appointed for the purpose of preparing
the matter for discussion by the body of the congress.
In such discussion all representatives can take part.
After the discussion follows the voting. The motion
must be carried unanimously to consummate the task
of the congress, for the vote of the majority has no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_536">[Pg 536]</a></span>
power whatever in regard to the dissenting parties.
But it is possible that the majority considers the motion
binding for its members. A protocol is to be kept of
all the discussions and the voting. If the discussions
and votings lead to a final result upon which the parties
agree, all the points agreed upon are drawn up in an
Act, which is signed by the representatives and which
is called the Final Act or the General Act of the congress
or conference. A party can make a declaration
or a reservation in signing the Act for the purpose of
excluding a certain interpretation of the Act in the
future. And the Act may expressly stipulate freedom
for States which were not parties to accede to it in
future.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_843_843"></a><a href="#FNanchor_843_843" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[843]</span></a> Thus at both Hague Peace Conferences the first Russian
delegate was elected president.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Different kinds of Transaction.</p></div>
<p>§ 486. <a id="International_transaction486"></a>International transaction is the term for
every act on the part of a State in its intercourse with
other States. Besides negotiation, which has been
discussed above in §§ 477-482, there are eleven other
kinds of international transactions which are of legal
importance—namely, declaration, notification, protest,
renunciation, recognition, intervention, retorsion, reprisals,
pacific blockade, war, and subjugation. Recognition
has already been discussed above in §§ 71-75,
as has also intervention in §§ 134-138, and, further,
subjugation in §§ 236-241. Retorsion, reprisals, pacific
blockade, and war will be treated in the second volume
of this work. There are, therefore, here to be discussed
only the remaining four transactions—namely, declaration,
notification, protest, and renunciation.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Declaration.</p></div>
<p>§ 487. <a id="The_term487"></a>The term "declaration" is used in three<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_537">[Pg 537]</a></span>
different meanings. It is, first, sometimes used as the
title of a body of stipulations of a treaty according to
which the parties engage themselves to pursue in future
a certain line of conduct. The Declaration of Paris,
1856, the Declaration of St. Petersburg, 1868, and the
Declaration of London, 1909, are instances of this.
Declarations of this kind differ in no respect from
treaties.<a id="FNanchor_844_844"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_844_844">[844]</a> One speaks, secondly, of declarations when
States communicate to other States or <i>urbi et orbi</i> an
explanation and justification of a line of conduct pursued
by them in the past, or an explanation of views
and intentions concerning certain matters. Declarations
of this kind may be very important, but they
hardly comprise transactions out of which rights and
duties of other States follow. But there is a third
kind of declarations out of which rights and duties do
follow for other States, and it is this kind which comprises
a specific international transaction, although the
different declarations belonging to this group are by
no means of a uniform character. Declarations of this
kind are declarations of war, declarations on the part
of belligerents concerning the goods they will condemn
as contraband, declarations at the outbreak of war on
the part of third States that they will remain neutral,
and others.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_844_844"></a><a href="#FNanchor_844_844" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[844]</span></a> See
 below, § <a href="#International_compacts508" class="pginternal">508</a>, where is mentioned the attempt of the
British Foreign Office to give to the term "declaration" a specific
meaning.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Notification.</p></div>
<p>§ 488. Notification is the technical term for the
communication to other States of the knowledge of
certain facts and events of legal importance. But a
distinction must be drawn between obligatory and
merely usual notification.</p>
<p>Notification has of late been stipulated in several
cases to be obligatory. Thus, according to article 34 of
the General Act of the Berlin Congo Conference of 1885,
notification of new occupations and the like on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_538">[Pg 538]</a></span>
African coast is obligatory. Thus, further, according to
article 84 of the Hague Convention for the peaceful
adjustment of international differences, in case a number
of States are parties to a treaty and two of the
parties are at variance concerning the interpretation of
such treaty and agree to have the difference settled by
arbitration, they have to notify this agreement to all
other parties to the treaty. Again, according to article
2 of the Hague Convention concerning the Commencement
of Hostilities, 1907, the outbreak of war must be
notified to the neutral Powers, and so must the declaration
of a blockade,<a id="FNanchor_845_845"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_845_845">[845]</a> according to article 11 of the
Declaration of London, 1909.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_845_845"></a><a href="#FNanchor_845_845" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[845]</span></a> See
 also Declaration of London, articles 11 (2), 16, 23,
25, and 26.</p></div>
<p>Apart from such cases in which notification is stipulated
as obligatory, it is in principle not obligatory,
although in fact it frequently takes place because
States cannot be considered subject to certain duties
without the knowledge of the facts and events which
give rise to these duties. Thus it is usual to notify to
other States changes in the headship and in the form
of government of a State, the establishment of a Federal
State, an annexation after conquest, the appointment
of a new Secretary for Foreign Affairs, and the like.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Protest.</p></div>
<p>§ 489. Protest is a formal communication on the
part of a State to another that it objects to an act
performed or contemplated by the latter. A protest
serves the purpose of preservation of rights, or of
making it known that the protesting State does not
acquiesce in and does not recognise certain acts. A
protest can be lodged with another State concerning
acts of the latter which have been notified to the former
or which have otherwise become known. On the other
hand, if a State acquires knowledge of an act which it
considers internationally illegal and against its rights,
and nevertheless does not protest, such attitude implies<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_539">[Pg 539]</a></span>
renunciation of such rights, provided a protest
would have been necessary to preserve a claim. It
may further happen that a State at first protests, but
afterwards either expressly<a id="FNanchor_846_846"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_846_846">[846]</a> or tacitly acquiesces in the
act. And it must be emphasised that under certain
circumstances and conditions a simple protest on the
part of a State without further action is not in itself
sufficient to preserve the rights in behalf of which the
protest was made.<a id="FNanchor_847_847"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_847_847">[847]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_846_846"></a><a href="#FNanchor_846_846" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[846]</span></a> Thus by section 2 of the Declaration concerning Siam,
Madagascar, and the New Hebrides, which is embodied in the Anglo-French
Agreement of April 8, 1904, Great Britain withdrew the protest which she
had raised against the introduction of the Customs tariff established at
Madagascar after the annexation to France.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_847_847"></a><a href="#FNanchor_847_847" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[847]</span></a> See
 below, § <a href="#Although_as_just_stated539" class="pginternal">539</a>,
concerning the withdrawal of Russia from
article 59 of the Treaty of Berlin, 1878, stipulating the freedom of the
port of Batoum.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Renunciation.</p></div>
<p>§ 490. Renunciation is the deliberate abandonment
of rights. It can be given <i>expressis verbis</i> or tacitly.
If, for instance, a State by occupation takes possession
of an island which has previously been occupied by
another State,<a id="FNanchor_848_848"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_848_848">[848]</a> the latter tacitly renounces its rights
by not protesting as soon as it receives knowledge of
the fact. Renunciation plays a prominent part in the
amicable settlement of differences between States, either
one or both parties frequently renouncing their claims
for the purpose of coming to an agreement. But it
must be specially observed that mere silence on the
part of a State does not imply renunciation; this occurs
only when a State remains silent, although a protest is
necessary to preserve a claim.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Conception of Treaties.</p></div>
<p>§ 491. <a id="International_treaties491"></a>International treaties are conventions or contracts
between two or more States concerning various
matters of interest. Even before a Law of Nations in
the modern sense of the term was in existence, treaties
used to be concluded between States. And although
in those times treaties were neither based on nor were
themselves a cause of an International Law, they were
nevertheless considered sacred and binding on account
of religious and moral sentiment. However, since the
manifold intercourse of modern times did not then exist
between the different States, treaties did not discharge
such all-important functions in the life of humanity as
they do now.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Different kinds of Treaties.</p></div>
<p>§ 492. <a id="These_important_functions492"></a>These important functions are manifest if
attention is given to the variety of international treaties
which exist nowadays and are day by day concluded for
innumerable purposes. In regard to State property,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_541">[Pg 541]</a></span>
treaties are concluded of cession, of boundary, and
many others. Alliances, treaties of protection, of
guarantee, of neutrality, and of peace are concluded
for political purposes. Various purposes are served
by consular treaties, commercial<a id="FNanchor_849_849"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_849_849">[849]</a> treaties, treaties in
regard to the post, telegraphs, and railways, treaties of
copyright and the like, of jurisdiction, of extradition,
monetary treaties, treaties in regard to measures and
weights, to rates, taxes, and custom-house duties,
treaties on the matter of sanitation with respect to
epidemics, treaties in the interest of industrial labourers,
and treaties with regard to agriculture and industry.
Again, various purposes are served by treaties concerning
warfare, mediation, arbitration, and so on.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_849_849"></a><a href="#FNanchor_849_849" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[849]</span></a> See
 below, §§ <a href="#Commercial_treaties578" class="pginternal">578</a>-<a href="#Most_of_the_commercial580" class="pginternal">580</a>.</p></div>
<p>I do not intend to discuss the question of classification
of the different kinds of treaties, for hitherto
all attempts<a id="FNanchor_850_850"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_850_850">[850]</a> at such classification have failed. But
there is one distinction to be made which is of the
greatest importance and according to which the whole
body of treaties is to be divided into two classes. For
treaties may, on the one hand, be concluded for the
purpose of confirming, defining, or abolishing existing
customary rules, and of establishing new rules for the
Law of Nations. Treaties of this kind ought to be
termed <i>law-making</i> treaties. On the other hand,
treaties may be concluded for all kinds of other purposes.
Law-making treaties as a source of rules of
International Law have been discussed above (§ <a href="#Treaties_are18" class="pginternal">18</a>);
the most important of these treaties will be considered
below (§§ <a href="#The_Final_Act556" class="pginternal">556</a>-568<i>b</i>).</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_850_850"></a><a href="#FNanchor_850_850" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[850]</span></a> Since the time of Grotius the science of the Law of Nations
has not ceased attempting a satisfactory classification of the different
kinds of treaties. See Heffter, §§ 88-91; Bluntschli, §§ 442-445;
Martens, I. § 113; Ullmann, § 82; Wheaton, § 268 (following Vattel, II.
§ 169); Rivier, II. pp. 106-118; Westlake, I. p. 283, and many others.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Binding Force of Treaties.</p></div>
<p>§ 493. <a id="The_question_as_to493"></a>The question as to the reason of the binding
force of international treaties always was, and still is,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_542">[Pg 542]</a></span>
very much disputed. That all those publicists who
deny the legal character of the Law of Nations deny
likewise a legally binding force in international treaties
is obvious. But even among those who acknowledge
the legal character of International Law, unanimity by
no means exists concerning this binding force of treaties.
The question is all the more important as everybody
knows that treaties are sometimes broken, rightly according
to the opinion of the one party, and wrongly
according to the opinion of the other. Many publicists
find the binding force of treaties in the Law of Nature,
others in religious and moral principles, others<a id="FNanchor_851_851"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_851_851">[851]</a> again
in the self-restraint exercised by States in becoming a
party to a treaty. Some writers<a id="FNanchor_852_852"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_852_852">[852]</a> assert that it is the
contracting parties' own will which gives binding force
to their treaties, and others<a id="FNanchor_853_853"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_853_853">[853]</a> teach that such binding
force is to be found <i>im Rechtsbewusstsein der Menschheit</i>—that
is, in the idea of right innate in man. I believe
that the question can satisfactorily be dealt with only
by dividing it into several different questions and by
answering those questions <i>seriatim</i>.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_853_853"></a><a href="#FNanchor_853_853" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[853]</span></a> So Bluntschli, § 410.</p></div>
<p>First, the question is to be answered why treaties
are legally binding. The answer must categorically be
that this is so because there exists a customary rule of
International Law that treaties are binding.</p>
<p>Then the question might be put as to the cause of
the existence of such customary rule. The answer
must be that such rule is the product of several joint
causes. Religious and moral reasons require such a
rule quite as much as the interest of the States, for no
law could exist between nations if such rule did not
exist. All causes which have been and are still working
to create and maintain an International Law are
at the background of this question.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_543">[Pg 543]</a></span></p>
<p>And, thirdly, the question might be put how it is
possible to speak of a legally binding force in treaties
without a judicial authority to enforce their stipulations.
The answer must be that the binding force of
treaties, although it is a legal force, is not the same as
the binding force of contracts according to Municipal
Law, since International Law is a weaker law, and for
this reason less enforceable, than Municipal Law. But
just as International Law does not lack legal character
in consequence of the fact that there is no central
authority<a id="FNanchor_854_854"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_854_854">[854]</a> above the States which could enforce it, so
international treaties are not deficient of a legally
binding force because there is no judicial authority for
the enforcement of their stipulations.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>The Treaty-making Power.</p></div>
<p>§ 494. The so-called right of making treaties is not
a right of a State in the technical meaning of the term,
but a mere competence attaching to sovereignty. A
State possesses, therefore, treating-making power only
so far as it is sovereign. Full-Sovereign States may
become parties to treaties of all kinds, being regularly
competent to make treaties on whatever matters they
please. Not-full Sovereign States, however, can become
parties to such treaties only according to their
competence to conclude. It is impossible to lay down<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_544">[Pg 544]</a></span>
a hard-and-fast rule concerning such competence of
all not-full Sovereign States. Everything depends
upon the special case. Thus, the constitutions of
Federal States comprise provisions with regard to the
competence, if any, of the member-States to conclude
international treaties among themselves as well as with
foreign States.<a id="FNanchor_855_855"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_855_855">[855]</a> Thus, again, it depends upon the
special relation between the suzerain and the vassal
how far the latter possesses the competence to enter
into treaties with foreign States; ordinarily a vassal
can conclude treaties concerning such matters as railways,
extradition, commerce, and the like.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_855_855"></a><a href="#FNanchor_855_855" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[855]</span></a> According to articles 7 and 9 of the Constitution of
Switzerland the Swiss member-States are competent to conclude
non-political treaties among themselves, and, further, such treaties
with foreign States as concern matters of police, of local traffic, and
of State economics. According to article 11 of the Constitution of the
German Empire, the German member-States are competent to conclude
treaties concerning all such matters as do not, in conformity with
article 4 of the Constitution, belong to the competence of the Empire.
On the other hand, according to article 1, section 10, of the
Constitution of the United States of America, the member-States are
incompetent either to conclude treaties among themselves or with foreign
States.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Treaty-making Power exercised by Heads of States.</p></div>
<p>§ 495. <a id="Th495"></a>The treaty-making power of all States is
exercised by their heads, either personally or through
representatives appointed by these heads. The Holy
Alliance of Paris, 1815, was personally concluded by
the Emperors of Austria and Russia and the King of
Prussia. And when, on June 24, 1859, the Austrian
army was defeated at Solferino, the Emperors of Austria
and France met on July 11, 1859, at Villafranca and
agreed in person on preliminaries of peace. Yet, as a
rule, heads of States do not act in person, but authorise
representatives to act for them. Such representatives
receive a written commission, known as powers
or full powers, which authorises them to negotiate in the
name of the respective heads of States. They also
receive oral or written, open or secret instructions.
But, as a rule, they do not conclude a treaty finally,
for all treaties concluded by such representatives are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_545">[Pg 545]</a></span>
in principle not valid before ratification.<a id="FNanchor_856_856"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_856_856">[856]</a> If they
conclude a treaty by exceeding their powers or acting
contrary to their instructions, the treaty is not a real
treaty and not binding upon the State they represent.
A treaty of such a kind is called a <i>sponsio</i> or <i>sponsiones</i>.
<i>Sponsiones</i> may become a real treaty and binding
upon the State through the latter's approval. Nowadays,
however, the difference between real treaties
and <i>sponsiones</i> is less important than in former times,
when the custom in favour of the necessity of ratification
for the validity of treaties was not yet general.
If nowadays representatives exceed their powers, their
States can simply refuse ratification of the <i>sponsio</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Minor Functionaries exercising Treaty-making Power.</p></div>
<p>§ 496. <a id="For_some_non-political496"></a>For some non-political purposes of minor
importance, certain minor functionaries are recognised
as competent to exercise the treaty-making power of
their States. Such functionaries are <i>ipso facto</i> by their
offices and duties competent to enter into certain agreements
without the requirement of ratification. Thus,
for instance, in time of war, military and naval officers
in command<a id="FNanchor_857_857"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_857_857">[857]</a> can enter into agreements concerning
a suspension of arms, the surrender of a fortress, the
exchange of prisoners, and the like. But it must be
emphasised that treaties of this kind are valid only
when these functionaries have not exceeded their
powers.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_857_857"></a><a href="#FNanchor_857_857" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[857]</span></a> See
 Grotius, III. c. 22.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Constitutional Restrictions.</p></div>
<p>§ 497. <a id="Al497"></a>Although the heads of States are regularly,
according to the Law of Nations, the organs that exercise
the treaty-making power of the States, constitutional
restrictions imposed upon the heads concerning
the exercise of this power are nevertheless of importance
for the Law of Nations. Such treaties concluded
by heads of States or representatives authorised by these
heads as violate constitutional restrictions are not real
treaties and do not bind the State concerned, because<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_546">[Pg 546]</a></span>
the representatives have exceeded their powers in concluding
the treaties.<a id="FNanchor_858_858"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_858_858">[858]</a> Such constitutional restrictions,
although they are not of great importance in Great
Britain,<a id="FNanchor_859_859"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_859_859">[859]</a> play a prominent part in the Constitutions
of most countries. Thus, according to article 8 of the
French Constitution, the President exercises the treaty-making
power; but peace treaties and such other
treaties as concern commerce, finance, and some other
matters, are not valid without the co-operation of the
French Parliament. Thus, further, according to articles
1, 4, and 11 of the Constitution of the German Empire,
the Emperor exercises the treaty-making power; but
such treaties as concern the frontier, commerce, and
several other matters, are not valid without the co-operation
of the Bundesrath and the Reichstag. Again,
according to article 2, section 2, of the Constitution of
the United States, the President can only ratify
treaties with the consent of the Senate.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_858_858"></a><a href="#FNanchor_858_858" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[858]</span></a> The whole matter is discussed with great lucidity by

 Anson, "The Law and Custom of the Constitution," II.
(2nd ed.), pp. 297-300.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Mutual Consent of the Contracting Parties.</p></div>
<p>§ 498. A treaty being a convention, mutual consent
of the parties is necessary. Mere proposals made by
one party and not accepted by the other are, therefore,
not binding upon the proposer. Without force are
also pollicitations which contain mere promises without
acceptance by the party to whom they were made.
Not binding are, lastly, so-called <i>punctationes</i>, mere
negotiations on the items of a future treaty, without
the parties entering into an obligation to conclude
that treaty. But such <i>punctationes</i> must not be confounded
either with a preliminary treaty or with a so-called
<i>pactum de contrahendo</i>. A preliminary treaty
requires the mutual consent of the parties with regard
to certain important points, whereas other points have
to be settled by the definitive treaty to be concluded
later. Such preliminary treaty is a real treaty and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_547">[Pg 547]</a></span>
therefore binding upon the parties. A <i>pactum de contrahendo</i>
requires likewise the mutual consent of the
parties. It is an agreement upon certain points to be
incorporated in a future treaty, and is binding upon
the parties. The difference between <i>punctationes</i> and
a <i>pactum de contrahendo</i> is, that the latter stipulates
an obligation of the parties to settle the respective
points by a treaty, whereas the former does not.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Freedom of Action of consenting Representatives.</p></div>
<p>§ 499. As a treaty will lack binding force without
real consent, absolute freedom of action on the part
of the contracting parties is required. It must, however,
be understood that circumstances of urgent distress,
such as either defeat in war or the menace of a
strong State to a weak State, are, according to the
rules of International Law, not regarded as excluding
the freedom of action of a party consenting to the
terms of a treaty. The phrase "freedom of action"
applies only to the <i>representatives</i> of the contracting
States. It is <i>their</i> freedom of action in consenting to
a treaty which must not have been interfered with and
which must not have been excluded by other causes.
A treaty concluded through intimidation exercised
against the representatives of either party or concluded
by intoxicated or insane representatives is not
binding upon the party so represented. But a State
which was forced by circumstances to conclude a treaty
containing humiliating terms has no right afterwards
to shake off the obligations of such treaty on the ground
that its freedom of action was interfered with at the
time.<a id="FNanchor_860_860"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_860_860">[860]</a> This must be emphasised, because in practice
such cases of repudiation have frequently occurred.
A State may, of course, hold itself justified by political
necessity in shaking off such obligations, but this does
not alter the fact that such action is a breach of law.</p>

real consent of the parties, it is nevertheless not binding
if the consent was given in error, or under a delusion
produced by a fraud of the other contracting
party. If, for instance, a boundary treaty were based
upon an incorrect map or a map fraudulently altered
by one of the parties, such treaty would by no means
be binding. Although there is freedom of action in
such cases, consent has been given under circumstances
which prevent the treaty from being binding.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Objects in general of Treaties.</p></div>
<p>§ 501. The object of treaties is always an obligation,
whether mutual between all the parties or unilateral
on the part of one only. Speaking generally, the object
of treaties can be an obligation concerning any matter
of interest for States. Since there exists no other law
than International Law for the intercourse of States
with each other, every agreement between them regarding
any obligation whatever is a treaty. However,
the Law of Nations prohibits some obligations from
becoming objects of treaties, so that such treaties as
comprise obligations of this kind are from the very
beginning null and void.<a id="FNanchor_861_861"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_861_861">[861]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_861_861"></a><a href="#FNanchor_861_861" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[861]</span></a> The voidance <i>ab origine</i> of these treaties must not be
confounded with voidance of such treaties as are valid in their
inception, but become afterwards void on some ground or other; see
 below, §§ <a href="#All_treaties541" class="pginternal">541</a>-544.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Obligations of Contracting Parties only can be Object.</p></div>
<p>§ 502. Obligations to be performed by a State other
than a contracting party cannot be the object of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_549">[Pg 549]</a></span>
treaty. A treaty stipulating such an obligation would
be null and void. But this must not be confounded with
the obligation undertaken by one of the contracting
States to exercise an influence upon another State to
perform certain acts. The object of a treaty with such
a stipulation is an obligation of one of the contracting
States, and the treaty is therefore valid and binding.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>An Obligation inconsistent with other Obligations cannot be
an Object.</p></div>
<p>§ 503. Such obligation as is inconsistent with obligations
under treaties previously concluded by one State
with another cannot be the object of a treaty with a
third State. Thus, in 1878, when after the war Russia
and Turkey concluded the preliminary Treaty of Peace
of San Stefano, which was inconsistent with the Treaty
of Paris of 1856 and the Convention of London of 1871,
England protested,<a id="FNanchor_862_862"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_862_862">[862]</a> and the Powers met at the Congress
of Berlin to arrange matters by mutual consent.</p>

<p>§ 504. An obligation to perform a physical impossibility<a id="FNanchor_863_863"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_863_863">[863]</a>
cannot be the object of a treaty. If perchance
a State entered into a convention stipulating an obligation
of that kind, no right to claim damages for non-fulfilment
of the obligation would arise for the other
party, such treaty being legally null and void.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Immoral Obligations.</p></div>
<p>§ 505. <a id="It_is_a_customarily_recognised505"></a>It is a customarily recognised rule of the Law
of Nations that immoral obligations cannot be the
object of an international treaty. Thus, an alliance for
the purpose of attacking a third State without provocation
is from the beginning not binding. It cannot be
denied that in the past many treaties stipulating immoral
obligations have been concluded and executed,
but this does not alter the fact that such treaties were
legally not binding upon the contracting parties. It
must, however, be taken into consideration that the
question as to what is immoral is often controversial.
An obligation which is considered immoral by other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_550">[Pg 550]</a></span>
States may not necessarily appear immoral to the
contracting parties, and there is no Court that can
decide the controversy.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Illegal Obligations.</p></div>
<p>§ 506. It is a unanimously recognised customary
rule of International Law that obligations which are
at variance with universally recognised principles of
International Law cannot be the object of a treaty.
If, for instance, a State entered into a convention with
another State not to interfere in case the latter should
appropriate a certain part of the Open Sea, or should
command its vessels to commit piratical acts on the
Open Sea, such treaty would be null and void, because
it is a principle of International Law that no part of
the Open Sea can be appropriated, and that it is the
duty of every State to interdict to its vessels the commission
of piracy on the High Seas.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>No necessary Form of Treaties.</p></div>
<p>§ 507. The Law of Nations includes no rule which
prescribes a necessary form of treaties. A treaty is,
therefore, concluded as soon as the mutual consent
of the parties becomes clearly apparent. Such consent
must always be given expressly, for a treaty cannot
be concluded by tacit consent. But it matters not
whether an agreement is made in writing, orally, or
by symbols. Thus, in time of war, the exhibition of
a white flag symbolises the proposal of an agreement
as to a brief truce for the purpose of certain negotiations,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_551">[Pg 551]</a></span>
and the acceptance of the proposal on the
part of the other side by the exhibition of a similar
symbol establishes a convention as binding as any
written treaty. Thus, too, history tells of an oral treaty
of alliance, secured by an oath, concluded in 1697 at
Pillau between Peter the Great of Russia and Frederick
III., Elector of Brandenburg.<a id="FNanchor_864_864"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_864_864">[864]</a> Again, treaties are
sometimes concluded through an exchange of diplomatic
notes between the Secretaries for Foreign Affairs
of two States or through the exchange of personal
letters between the heads of two States. However, as
a matter of reason, treaties usually take the form of
a written<a id="FNanchor_865_865"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_865_865">[865]</a> document signed by duly authorised representatives
of the contracting parties.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_865_865"></a><a href="#FNanchor_865_865" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[865]</span></a> The only writer who nowadays insists upon a <i>written</i>
agreement for a treaty to be valid is, as far as I know, Bulmerincq (§
56). But although all important treaties are naturally concluded in
writing, the example of the agreements concluded between armed forces in
time of war either orally or through symbols proves that the written
form is not absolutely necessary.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Acts, Conventions, Declarations.</p></div>
<p>§ 508. <a id="International_compacts508"></a>International compacts which take the form of
written contracts, are, besides <i>Agreements</i> or <i>Treaties</i>,
sometimes termed <i>Acts</i>, sometimes <i>Conventions</i>, sometimes
<i>Declarations</i>. But there is no essential difference
between them, and their binding force upon the contracting
parties is the same whatever be their name. The
Geneva Convention, the Declarations of Paris and of
London, and the Final Act of the Vienna Congress are
as binding as any agreement which goes under the name
of "Treaty" or "Convention." The attempt<a id="FNanchor_866_866"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_866_866">[866]</a> to
distinguish fundamentally between a "Declaration"
and a "Convention" by maintaining that whereas a
"Convention" creates rules of particular International
Law between the contracting States only, a "Declaration"
contains the recognition, on the part of the best
qualified and most interested Powers, of rules of universal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_552">[Pg 552]</a></span>
International Law, does not stand the test of
scientific criticism. A "Declaration" is nothing else
but the title of a law-making treaty according to which
the parties engage themselves to pursue in future a
certain line of conduct.<a id="FNanchor_867_867"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_867_867">[867]</a> But such law-making treaties
are quite as frequently styled "Conventions" as
"Declarations." The best example is the Hague
"Convention" concerning the laws and usages of war,
which is based upon the unratified "Declaration"
concerning the laws and customs of war produced by
the Brussels Conference of 1874.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Parts of Treaties.</p></div>
<p>§ 509. Since International Law lays down no rules
concerning the form of treaties, there exist no rules
concerning the arrangement of the parts of written
treaties. But the following order is usually observed.
A first part, the so-called <i>preamble</i>, comprises the names
of the heads of the contracting States, of their duly
authorised representatives, and the motives for the
conclusion of the treaty. A second part consists of the
primary stipulations in numbered articles. A third
part consists of miscellaneous stipulations concerning
the duration of the treaty, its ratification, the accession
of third Powers, and the like. The last part comprises
the signatures of the representatives. But this order
is by no means necessary. Sometimes, for instance,
the treaty itself does not contain the very stipulations
upon which the contracting parties have agreed, such
stipulations being placed in an annex to the treaty.
It may also happen that a treaty contains secret stipulations
in an additional part, which are not made public
with the bulk of the stipulations.<a id="FNanchor_868_868"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_868_868">[868]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Conception and Function of Ratification.</p></div>
<p>§ 510. <a id="Ratification_is_the_term510"></a>Ratification is the term for the final confirmation
given by the parties to an international treaty
concluded by their representatives. Although a treaty
is concluded as soon as the mutual consent is manifest
from acts of the duly authorised representatives, its
binding force is as a rule suspended till ratification is
given. The function of ratification is, therefore, to
make the treaty binding, and, if it is refused, the treaty
falls to the ground in consequence. As long as ratification
is not given, the treaty is, although concluded, not
perfect. Many writers<a id="FNanchor_869_869"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_869_869">[869]</a> maintain that, as a treaty is
not binding without ratification, it is the latter which
really contains the mutual consent and really concludes
the treaty. Before ratification, they maintain, there is
no treaty concluded, but a mere mutual proposal agreed
to to conclude a treaty. But this opinion does not
accord with the real facts.<a id="FNanchor_870_870"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_870_870">[870]</a> For the representatives
are authorised and intend to conclude a treaty by their
signatures. The contracting States have always taken
the standpoint that a treaty is concluded as soon as
their mutual consent is clearly apparent. They have
always made a distinction between their consent given
by representatives and their ratification to be given<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_554">[Pg 554]</a></span>
afterwards, they have never dreamt of confounding
the two and considering their ratification their consent.
It is for that reason that a treaty cannot be ratified in
part, that no alterations of the treaty are possible
through the act of ratification, that a treaty may be
tacitly ratified by its execution, that a treaty always
is dated from the day when it was duly signed by the
representatives and not from the day of its ratification,
that there is no essential difference between such
treaties as want and such as do not want ratification.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_869_869"></a><a href="#FNanchor_869_869" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[869]</span></a> See,
 for instance, Ullmann, § 78; Jellinek, p. 55; Nippold,
p. 123; Wegmann, p. 11.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_870_870"></a><a href="#FNanchor_870_870" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[870]</span></a> The matter is very ably discussed by Rivier, II. pp 74-76.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Rationale for the Institution of Ratification.</p></div>
<p>§ 511. The rationale for the institution of ratification
is another argument for the contention that the
conclusion of the treaty by the representatives is to be
distinguished from the confirmation given by the
respective States through ratification. The reason is
that States want to have an opportunity of re-examining
not the single stipulations, but the whole effect of
the treaty upon their interests. These interests may
be of various kinds. They may undergo a change
immediately after the signing of the treaty by the
representatives. They may appear to public opinion
in a different light from that in which they appear to
the Governments, so that the latter want to reconsider
the matter. Another reason is that treaties on many
important matters are, according to the Constitutional
Law of most States, not valid without some kind of
consent of Parliaments. Governments must therefore
have an opportunity of withdrawing from a treaty in
case Parliaments refuse their recognition. These two
reasons have made, and still make, the institution of
ratification a necessity for International Law.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Ratification regularly, but not absolutely, necessary.</p></div>
<p>§ 512. But ratification, although necessary in principle,
is not always essential. Although it is now a
universally recognised customary rule of International
Law that treaties are regularly in need of ratification,
even if the latter was not expressly stipulated, there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_555">[Pg 555]</a></span>
are exceptions to the rule. For treaties concluded by
such State functionaries<a id="FNanchor_871_871"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_871_871">[871]</a> as have within certain narrow
limits, <i>ipso facto</i> by their office, the power to exercise
the treaty-making competence of their State do not
want ratification, but are binding at once when they
are concluded, provided the respective functionaries
have not exceeded their powers. Further, treaties
concluded by heads of States in person do not want
ratification provided that they do not concern matters
in regard to which constitutional restrictions<a id="FNanchor_872_872"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_872_872">[872]</a> are
imposed upon heads of States. And, lastly, it may
happen that the contracting parties stipulate expressly,
for the sake of a speedy execution of a treaty, that it
shall be binding at once without ratifications being
necessary. Thus, the Treaty of London of July 15,
1840, between Great Britain, Austria, Russia, Prussia,
and Turkey concerning the pacification of the Turko-Egyptian
conflict was accompanied by a secret protocol,<a id="FNanchor_873_873"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_873_873">[873]</a>
signed by the representatives of the parties,
according to which the treaty was at once, without
being ratified, to be executed. For the Powers were,
on account of the victories of Mehemet Ali, very anxious
to settle the conflict as quickly as possible. But it
must be emphasised that renunciation of ratification
is valid only if given by representatives duly authorised
to make such renunciation. If the representatives
have not received a special authorisation to dispense
with ratification, then renunciation is not binding upon
the States which they represent.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Length of Time for Ratification.</p></div>
<p>§ 513. No rule of International Law prescribes the
length of time within which ratification must be given
or refused. If such length of time is not specially stipulated
by the contracting parties in the very treaty, a
reasonable length of time must be presumed as mutually<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_556">[Pg 556]</a></span>
granted. Without doubt, a refusal to ratify must be
presumed from the lapse of an unreasonable time without
ratification having been made. In most cases, however,
treaties which are in need of ratification contain nowadays
a clause stipulating the reservation of ratification,
and at the same time a length of time within which
ratification should take place.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Refusal of Ratification.</p></div>
<p>§ 514. The question now requires attention whether
ratification can be refused on just grounds only or
according to discretion. Formerly<a id="FNanchor_874_874"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_874_874">[874]</a> it was maintained
that ratification could not be refused in case the representatives
had not exceeded their powers or violated
their secret instructions. But nowadays there is probably
no publicist who maintains that a State is in any
case <i>legally</i><a id="FNanchor_875_875"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_875_875">[875]</a> bound not to refuse ratification. Yet
many insist that a State is, except for just reasons, in
principle <i>morally</i> bound not to refuse ratification. I
cannot see, however, the value of such a moral in contradistinction
to a legal duty. The fact upon which everybody
agrees is that International Law does in no case
impose a duty of ratification upon a contracting party.
A State refusing ratification will always have reasons
for such line of action which appear just to itself,
although they may be unjust in the eyes of others. In
practice, ratification is given or withheld at discretion.
But in the majority of cases, of course, ratification is
not refused. A State which often and apparently
wantonly refused ratification of treaties would lose all
credit in international negotiations and would soon feel
the consequences. On the other hand, it is impossible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_557">[Pg 557]</a></span>
to lay down hard-and-fast rules respecting just and
unjust causes of refusal of ratification. The interests
at stake are so various, and the circumstances which
must influence a State are so imponderable, that it must
be left to the discretion of every State to decide the
question for itself. Numerous examples of important
treaties which have not found ratification can be given.
It suffices to mention the Hay-Pauncefote Treaty between
the United States and Great Britain regarding
the proposed Nicaragua Canal, signed on February 5,
1900, which was ratified with modifications by the
Senate of the United States, this being equivalent to
refusal of ratification. (See
 below, § <a href="#It_follows_from517" class="pginternal">517</a>.)</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_874_874"></a><a href="#FNanchor_874_874" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[874]</span></a> See
 Grotius, II. c. 11, § 12; Bynkershoek, "Quaestiones
juris publici," II. 7; Wicquefort, "L'Ambassadeur," II. 15; Vattel, II.
§ 156; G. F. von Martens, § 48.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_875_875"></a><a href="#FNanchor_875_875" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[875]</span></a> This must be maintained in spite of Wegmann's (p. 32)
assertion that a customary rule of the Law of Nations has to be
recognised that ratification can not regularly be refused. The
hair-splitting scholasticism of this writer is illustrated by a
comparison between his customary rule for the non-refusal of
ratification as arbitrarily constructed by himself, and the opinion
which he (p. 11) emphatically defends that a treaty is concluded only by
ratification.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Form of Ratification.</p></div>
<p>§ 515. No rule of International Law exists which
prescribes a necessary form of ratification. Ratification
can therefore be given as well tacitly as expressly.
Tacit ratification takes place when a State begins the
execution of a treaty without expressly ratifying it.
Further, ratification may be given orally or in writing,
although I am not aware of any case in which ratification
was given orally. For it is usual for ratification
to take the form of a document duly signed by the
heads of the States concerned and their Secretaries
for Foreign Affairs. It is usual to draft as many documents
as there are parties to the convention, and to
exchange these documents between the parties. Sometimes
the whole of the treaty is recited <i>verbatim</i> in the
ratifying documents, but sometimes only the title,
preamble, and date of the treaty, and the names of the
signatory representatives are cited. As ratification is
the necessary confirmation only of an already existing
treaty, the essential requirement in a ratifying document
is merely that it refer clearly and unmistakably
to the treaty to be ratified. The citation of title, preamble,
date, and names of the representatives is, therefore,
quite sufficient to satisfy that requirement, and I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_558">[Pg 558]</a></span>
cannot agree with those writers who maintain that the
whole of the treaty ought to be recited <i>verbatim</i>.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Ratification by whom effected.</p></div>
<p>§ 516. Ratification is effected by those organs which
exercise the treaty-making power of the States. These
organs are regularly the heads of the States, but they
can, according to the Municipal Law of some States,
delegate the power of ratification for some parts of the
globe to other representatives. Thus, the Viceroy of India
is empowered to ratify treaties with certain Asiatic monarchs
in the name of the King of Great Britain and
Emperor of India, and the Governor-General of Turkestan
has a similar power for the Emperor of Russia.</p>
<p>In case the head of a State ratifies a treaty, although
the necessary constitutional requirements have not
been previously fulfilled, as, for instance, in the case
in which a treaty has not received the necessary approval
from the Parliament of the said State, the question
arises whether such ratification is valid or null
and void. Many writers<a id="FNanchor_876_876"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_876_876">[876]</a> maintain that such ratification
is nevertheless valid. But this opinion is not
correct, because it is clearly evident that in such a
case the head of the State has exceeded his powers,
and that, therefore, the State concerned cannot be held
to be bound by the treaty.<a id="FNanchor_877_877"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_877_877">[877]</a> The conflict between the
United States and France in 1831, frequently quoted in
support of the opinion that such ratification is valid,
is not in point. It is true that the United States insisted
on payment of the indemnity stipulated by a
treaty which had been ratified by the King of France
without having received the necessary approval of the
French Parliament, but the United States did not
maintain that the ratification was valid; she insisted
upon payment because the French Government had
admitted that such indemnity was due to her.<a id="FNanchor_878_878"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_878_878">[878]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Ratification can not be partial and conditional.</p></div>
<p>§ 517. <a id="It_follows_from517"></a>It follows from the nature of ratification
as a necessary confirmation of a treaty already concluded
that ratification must be either given or refused,
no conditional or partial ratification being possible.
That occasionally a State tries to modify a treaty in
ratifying it cannot be denied, yet conditional ratification
is no ratification at all, but equivalent to refusal
of ratification. Nothing, of course, prevents the other
contracting party from entering into fresh negotiations
in regard to such modifications; but it must be emphasised
that such negotiations are negotiations for a new
treaty,<a id="FNanchor_879_879"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_879_879">[879]</a> the old treaty having become null and void
through its conditional ratification. On the other
hand, no obligation exists for such party to enter into
fresh negotiations, it being a fact that conditional
ratification is identical with refusal of ratification,
whereby the treaty falls to the ground. Thus, for
instance, when the United States Senate on December
20, 1900, in consenting<a id="FNanchor_880_880"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_880_880">[880]</a> to the ratification of the Hay-Pauncefote
Treaty as regards the Nicaragua Canal,
added modifying amendments, Great Britain did not
accept the amendments and considered the treaty
fallen to the ground.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_879_879"></a><a href="#FNanchor_879_879" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[879]</span></a> This is the correct explanation of the practice on the part
of States, which sometimes prevails, of acquiescing, after some
hesitation, in alterations proposed by a party to a treaty in ratifying
it; see examples in Pradier-Fodéré, II. No. 1104, and Calvo, III. §
1630.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_880_880"></a><a href="#FNanchor_880_880" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[880]</span></a> It is of importance to emphasise that the United States'
Senate, in proposing an amendment to a treaty before its ratification,
does not, strictly speaking, ratify such treaty conditionally, since it
is the President, and not the Senate, who possesses the power of
granting or refusing ratification; see Willoughby, "The Constitutional
Law of the United States" (1910), I. p. 462, note 14. The President,
however, according to article 2 of the Constitution, cannot grant
ratification without the consent of the Senate, and the proposal of an
amendment to a treaty on the part of the Senate, therefore, comprises,
indirectly, the proposal of a new treaty.</p></div>
<p>Quite particular is the case of a treaty to which a
greater number of States are parties and which is only
partially ratified by one of the contracting parties.
Thus France, in ratifying the General Act of the Brussels<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_560">[Pg 560]</a></span>
Anti-Slavery Conference of July 2, 1890, excepted from
ratification articles 21 to 23 and 42 to 61, and the Powers
have acquiesced in this partial ratification, so that France
is not bound by these twenty-three articles.<a id="FNanchor_881_881"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_881_881">[881]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_881_881"></a><a href="#FNanchor_881_881" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[881]</span></a> See
 Martens, N.R.G. 2nd Ser. XXII. (1897), p. 260.</p></div>
<p>But it must be emphasised that ratification is only
then partial and conditional if one or more stipulations
of the treaty which has been signed without reservation
are exempted from ratification, or if an amending clause
is added to the treaty during the process of ratification.
It is therefore quite legitimate for a party who has
signed a treaty with certain reservations as regards
certain articles<a id="FNanchor_882_882"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_882_882">[882]</a> to ratify the approved articles only,
and it would be incorrect to speak in this case of a
partial ratification.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_882_882"></a><a href="#FNanchor_882_882" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[882]</span></a> See
 below, § <a href="#By_a_treaty_the_contracting519" class="pginternal">519</a>.</p></div>
<p>Again, it is quite legitimate—and one ought not in
that case to speak of conditional ratification—for a
contracting party who wants to secure the interpretation
of certain terms and clauses of a treaty to grant
ratification with the understanding only that such terms
and clauses should be interpreted in such and such a
way. Thus when, in 1911, opposition arose in Great
Britain to the ratification of the Declaration of London
on account of the fact that the meaning of certain terms
was ambiguous and that the wording of certain clauses
did not agree with the interpretation given to them by
the Report of the Drafting Committee, the British
Government declared that they would only ratify with
the understanding that the interpretation contained in
the Report should be considered as binding and that
the ambiguous terms concerned should have a determinate
meaning. In such cases ratification does not
introduce an amendment or an alteration, but only
fixes the meaning of otherwise doubtful terms and
clauses of the treaty.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_561">[Pg 561]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Effect of Ratification.</p></div>
<p>§ 518. <a id="The_effect_of_ratification518"></a>The effect of ratification is the binding force
of the treaty. But the question arises whether the
effect of ratification is retroactive, so that a treaty
appears to be binding from the date when it is duly
signed by the representatives. No unanimity exists
among publicists as regards this question. As in all
important cases treaties themselves stipulate the date
from which they are to take effect, the question is
chiefly of theoretical interest. The fact that ratification
imparts the binding force to a treaty seems to indicate
that ratification has regularly no retroactive effect.
Different, however, is of course the case in which the
contrary is expressly stipulated in the very treaty, and,
again, the case when a treaty contains such stipulations
as shall at once be executed, without waiting for the
necessary ratification. Be this as it may, ratification
makes a treaty binding only if the original consent was
not given in error or under a delusion.<a id="FNanchor_883_883"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_883_883">[883]</a> If, however,
the ratifying State discovers such error or delusion and
ratifies the treaty nevertheless, such ratification makes
the treaty binding. And the same is valid as regards
a ratification given to a treaty although the ratifying

<div class="sidenote"><p>Effect of Treaties upon Contracting Parties.</p></div>
<p>§ 519. <a id="By_a_treaty_the_contracting519"></a>By a treaty the contracting parties in the first
place are concerned. The effect of the treaty upon
them is that they are bound by its stipulations, and that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_562">[Pg 562]</a></span>
they must execute it in all its parts. No distinction
should be made between more and less important parts
of a treaty as regards its execution. Whatever may be
the importance or the insignificance of a part of a treaty,
it must be executed with good faith, for the binding
force of a treaty covers equally all its parts and stipulations.
If, however, a party to a treaty concluded
between more than two parties signs it with a reservation
as regards certain articles, such party is not bound
by these articles, although it ratifies<a id="FNanchor_884_884"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_884_884">[884]</a> the treaty.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_884_884"></a><a href="#FNanchor_884_884" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[884]</span></a> See

<div class="sidenote"><p>Effect of Treaties upon the Subjects of the Parties.</p></div>
<p>§ 520. It must be specially observed that the binding
force of a treaty concerns the contracting States only,
and not their subjects. As International Law is a law
between States only and exclusively, treaties can have
effect upon States and can bind States only and exclusively.
If treaties contain stipulations with regard
to rights and duties of the contracting States' subjects,<a id="FNanchor_885_885"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_885_885">[885]</a>
courts, officials, and the like, these States have to take
such steps as are necessary, according to their Municipal
Law, to make these stipulations binding upon
their subjects, courts, officials, and the like. It may
be that according to the Municipal Laws of some countries
the official publication of a treaty concluded by
the Government is sufficient for this purpose, but in
other countries other steps are necessary, such as,
for example, special statutes to be passed by the respective
Parliaments.<a id="FNanchor_886_886"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_886_886">[886]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_885_885"></a><a href="#FNanchor_885_885" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[885]</span></a> See
 above, § <a href="#No289" class="pginternal">289</a>.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_886_886"></a><a href="#FNanchor_886_886" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[886]</span></a> The distinction between International and Municipal Law as
discussed above, §§ 20-25, is the basis from which the question must be
decided whether international treaties have a direct effect upon the
officials and subjects of the contracting parties.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Effect of Changes in Government upon Treaties.</p></div>
<p>§ 521. <a id="As_treaties_are_binding521"></a>As treaties are binding upon the contracting
States, changes in the government or even in the form
of government of one of the parties can as a rule have
no influence whatever upon the binding force of treaties.
Thus, for instance, a treaty of alliance concluded by a
State with constitutional government remains valid,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_563">[Pg 563]</a></span>
although the Ministry may change. And no head of
a State can shirk the obligations of a treaty concluded
by his State under the government of his predecessor.
Even when a monarchy turns into a republic, or <i>vice
versa</i>, treaty obligations regularly remain the same.
For all such changes and alterations, important as they
may be, do not alter the person of the State which
concluded the treaty. If, however, a treaty stipulation
essentially presupposes a certain form of government,
then a change from such form makes such stipulation
void, because its execution has become impossible.<a id="FNanchor_887_887"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_887_887">[887]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_887_887"></a><a href="#FNanchor_887_887" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[887]</span></a> See
 below, § <a href="#All_treaties_whose542" class="pginternal">542</a>. Not to be confounded with the effect of
changes in government is the effect of a change in international status
upon treaties, as, for instance, if a hitherto full-sovereign State
becomes half- or part-Sovereign, or <i>vice versa</i>, or if a State merges
entirely into another, and the like. This is a case of succession of
States which has been discussed
 above, §§ <a href="#When_a_State_merges82" class="pginternal">82</a>-84; see also
 below, § <a href="#A_cause_which548" class="pginternal">548</a>.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Effect of Treaties upon third States.</p></div>
<p>§ 522. <a id="According_to_the_principle522"></a>According to the principle <i>pacta tertiis nec
nocent nec prosunt</i>, a treaty concerns the contracting
States only; neither rights nor duties, as a rule, arise
under a treaty for third States which are not parties to
the treaty. But sometimes treaties have indeed an effect
upon third States. Such an effect is always produced
when a treaty touches previous treaty rights of third
States. Thus, for instance, a commercial treaty conceding
more favourable conditions than hitherto have
been conceded by the parties thereto has an effect upon
all such third States as have previously concluded commercial
treaties containing the so-called <i>most-favoured-nation
clause</i><a id="FNanchor_888_888"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_888_888">[888]</a> with one of the contracting parties.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_888_888"></a><a href="#FNanchor_888_888" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[888]</span></a> See
 below, § <a href="#Most_of_the_commercial580" class="pginternal">580</a>, but note the American interpretation of
this clause.</p></div>
<p>The question arises whether in exceptional cases
third States can acquire rights under such treaties as
were specially concluded for the purpose of creating
such rights not only for the contracting parties but also
for third States. Thus, the Hay-Pauncefote Treaty
between Great Britain and the United States of 1901,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_564">[Pg 564]</a></span>
and the Hay-Varilla Treaty between the United States
and Panama of 1903, stipulate that the Panama Canal
to be built shall be open to vessels of commerce and of
war of all nations, although Great Britain, the United
States, and Panama only are parties.<a id="FNanchor_889_889"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_889_889">[889]</a> Thus, further,
article 5 of the Boundary Treaty of Buenos Ayres of
September 15, 1881, stipulates that the Straits of
Magellan shall be open to vessels of all nations, although
Argentina and Chili only are parties. Again, the Treaty
of Paris, signed on March 30, 1856, and annexed to the
Peace Treaty of Paris of 1856, stipulates that Russia
shall not fortify the Aland<a id="FNanchor_890_890"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_890_890">[890]</a> Islands; although this
stipulation was made in the interest of Sweden, only
Great Britain, France, and Russia are parties. I believe
that the question must be answered in the negative,
and nothing prevents the contracting parties from
altering such a treaty without the consent of third States,
provided the latter have not in the meantime acquired
such rights through the unanimous tacit consent of all
concerned.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_889_889"></a><a href="#FNanchor_889_889" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[889]</span></a> See
 above, § <a href="#Already_in184" class="pginternal">184</a>.</p></div>

 above, <a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="pginternal">§ 205, p. 277, note 2</a>.</p></div>
<p>It must be emphasised that a treaty between two
States can never invalidate a stipulation previously
created by a treaty between one of the contracting
parties and a third State, unless the latter expressly
consents. If, for instance, two States have entered
into an alliance and one of them afterwards concludes a
treaty with a third State, according to which all conflicts
without exception shall be settled by arbitration,
the previous treaty of alliance remains valid even in
the case of war breaking out between the third State
and the other party to the alliance.<a id="FNanchor_891_891"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_891_891">[891]</a> Therefore, when
in 1911 Great Britain contemplated entering, with the
United States of America, into a treaty of general
arbitration according to which all differences should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_565">[Pg 565]</a></span>
be decided by arbitration, she notified Japan of her
intention, on account of the existing treaty of alliance,
and Japan consented to substitute for the old treaty
a new treaty of alliance,<a id="FNanchor_892_892"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_892_892">[892]</a> article 4 of which stipulates
that the alliance shall never concern a war with
a third Power with whom one of the allies may have
concluded a treaty of general arbitration.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What means have been in use.</p></div>
<p>§ 523. As there is no international institution which
could enforce the performance of treaties, and as history
teaches that treaties have frequently been broken,
various means of securing performance of treaties have
been made use of. The more important of these means
are oaths, hostages, pledges, occupation of territory,
guarantee. Nowadays these means, which are for the
most part obsolete, have no longer great importance
on account of the gratifying fact that all States are
now much more conscientious and faithful as regards
their treaty obligations than in former times.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Oaths.</p></div>
<p>§ 524. Oaths are a very old means of securing the
performance of treaties, which was constantly made use
of not only in antiquity and the Middle Ages, but also
in modern times. For in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries all important treaties were still secured by
oaths. During the eighteenth century, however, the
custom of securing treaties by oaths gradually died out,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_566">[Pg 566]</a></span>
the last example being the treaty of alliance between
France and Switzerland in 1777, which was solemnly confirmed
by the oaths of both parties in the Cathedral at
Solothurn. The employment of oaths for securing treaties
was of great value in the times of absolutism, when little
difference used to be made between the State and its
monarch. The more the distinction grew into existence
between the State as the subject of International Law
on the one hand, and the monarch as the temporary
chief organ of the State on the other hand, the more
such oaths fell into disuse. For an oath can exercise
its force on the individual only who takes it, and not
on the State for which it is taken.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Hostages.</p></div>
<p>§ 525. Hostages are as old a means of securing
treaties as oaths, but they have likewise, for ordinary
purposes<a id="FNanchor_893_893"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_893_893">[893]</a> at least, become obsolete, because they have
practically no value at all. The last case of a treaty
secured by hostages is the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle
in 1748, in which hostages were stipulated to be sent
by England to France for the purpose of securing the
restitution of Cape Breton Island to the latter. The
hostages sent were Lords Sussex and Cathcart, who
remained in France till July 1749.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_893_893"></a><a href="#FNanchor_893_893" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[893]</span></a> Concerning hostages nowadays taken in time of war, see

<div class="sidenote"><p>Pledge.</p></div>
<p>§ 526. <a id="Th526"></a>The pledging of movable property by one of
the contracting parties to the other for the purpose of
securing the performance of a treaty is possible, but
has not frequently occurred. Thus, Poland is said to
have pledged her crown jewels once to Prussia.<a id="FNanchor_894_894"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_894_894">[894]</a> The
pledging of movables is nowadays quite obsolete,
although it might on occasion be revived.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_894_894"></a><a href="#FNanchor_894_894" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[894]</span></a> See
 Phillimore, II. § 55.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Occupation of Territory.</p></div>
<p>§ 527. <a id="Oc527"></a>Occupation of territory, such as a fort or even
a whole province, as a means of securing the performance
of a treaty, has frequently been made use of with regard
to the payment of large sums of money due to a State<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_567">[Pg 567]</a></span>
under a treaty. Nowadays such occupation is only
resorted to in connection with treaties of peace stipulating
the payment of a war indemnity. Thus, the
preliminary peace treaty of Versailles in 1871 stipulated
that Germany should have the right to keep certain
parts of France under military occupation until the final
payment of the war indemnity of five milliards of francs.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Guarantee.</p></div>
<p>§ 528. <a id="The_best528"></a>The best means of securing treaties, and one
which is still in use generally, is the guarantee of such
other States as are not directly affected by the treaty.
Such guarantee is a kind of accession<a id="FNanchor_895_895"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_895_895">[895]</a> to the guaranteed
treaty, and a treaty in itself—namely, the promise of
the guarantor eventually to do what is in his power to
compel the contracting party or parties to execute the
treaty.<a id="FNanchor_896_896"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_896_896">[896]</a> Guarantee of a treaty is a species only of
guarantee in general, which will be discussed below,

Nos. 1025-1031—Martens, I. § 111.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Interest and Participation to be distinguished.</p></div>
<p>§ 529. Ordinarily a treaty creates rights and duties
between the contracting parties exclusively. Nevertheless,
third States may be interested in such treaties,
for the common interests of the members of the Family
of Nations are so interlaced that few treaties between
single members can be concluded in which third States
have not some kind of interest. But such interest, all-important
as it may be, must not be confounded with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_568">[Pg 568]</a></span>
participation of third States in treaties. Such participation
can occur in five different forms—namely, good
offices, mediation, intervention, accession, and adhesion.<a id="FNanchor_897_897"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_897_897">[897]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_897_897"></a><a href="#FNanchor_897_897" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[897]</span></a> That certain treaties concluded by the suzerain are <i>ipso
facto</i> concluded for the vassal State does not make the latter
participate in such treaties. Nor is it correct to speak of
participation of a third State in a treaty when a State becomes party to
a treaty through the fact that it has given a mandate to another State
to contract on its behalf.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Good Offices and Mediation.</p></div>
<p>§ 530. A treaty may be concluded with the help of
the good offices or through the mediation of a third
State, whether these offices be asked for by the contracting
parties or be exercised spontaneously by a
third State. Such third State, however, does not
necessarily, either through good offices or through mediation,
become a real party to the treaty, although this
might be the case. A great many of the most important
treaties owe their existence to the good offices
or mediation of third Powers. The difference between
good offices and mediation will be discussed
 below, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41047/41047-h/41047-h.htm#Di9" class="pgexternal" id="id-440325918088859842">vol. II. § 9</a>.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Intervention.</p></div>
<p>§ 531. A third State may participate in a treaty in
such a way that it interposes dictatorially between two
States negotiating a treaty and requests them to drop
or to insert certain stipulations. Such intervention
does not necessarily make the interfering State a real
party to the treaty. Instances of threatened intervention
of such a kind are the protest on the part of
Great Britain against the preliminary peace treaty concluded
in 1878 at San Stefano<a id="FNanchor_898_898"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_898_898">[898]</a> between Russia and
Turkey, and that on the part of Russia, Germany, and
France in 1895 against the peace treaty of Shimonoseki<a id="FNanchor_899_899"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_899_899">[899]</a>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Accession.</p></div>
<p>§ 532. <a id="Of_accession_there_are_two_kinds532"></a>Of accession there are two kinds. Accession
means, firstly, the formal entrance of a third State
into an existing treaty so that such State becomes a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_569">[Pg 569]</a></span>
party to the treaty with all rights and duties arising
therefrom. Such accession can take place only with
the consent of the original contracting parties, and
accession always constitutes a treaty of itself. Very
often the contracting parties stipulate expressly that the
treaty shall be open to the accession of a certain State.
And the so-called law-making treaties, as the Declaration
of Paris or the Geneva Convention for example, regularly
stipulate the option of accession of all such States
as have not been originally contracting parties.</p>
<p>But there is, secondly, another kind of accession
possible. For a State may enter into a treaty between
other States for the purpose of guarantee.<a id="FNanchor_900_900"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_900_900">[900]</a> This kind
of accession makes the acceding State also a party to
the treaty; but the rights and duties of the acceding
State are different from the rights and duties of the
other parties, for the former is a guarantor only, whereas
the latter are directly affected by the treaty.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_900_900"></a><a href="#FNanchor_900_900" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[900]</span></a> See
 above, § <a href="#The_best528" class="pginternal">528</a>.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Adhesion.</p></div>
<p>§ 533. Adhesion is defined as such entrance of a third
State into an existing treaty as takes place either with
regard only to a part of the stipulations or with regard
only to certain principles laid down in the treaty.
Whereas through accession a third State becomes a
party to the treaty with all the rights and duties arising
from it, through adhesion a third State becomes a
party only to such parts or principles of the treaty as
it has adhered to. But it must be specially observed
that the distinction between accession and adhesion is
one made in theory, to which practice frequently does
not correspond. Often treaties speak of accession of third
States where in fact adhesion only is meant, and <i>vice
versa</i>. Thus, article 6 of the Hague Convention with
respect to the laws and customs of war on land stipulates
the possibility of future <i>adhesion</i> of non-signatory
Powers, although accession is meant.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_570">[Pg 570]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Expiration and Dissolution in Contradistinction to
Fulfilment.</p></div>
<p>§ 534. <a id="The_binding_force_of534"></a>The binding force of treaties may terminate
in four different ways, because a treaty may either
expire, or be dissolved, or become void, or be cancelled.<a id="FNanchor_901_901"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_901_901">[901]</a>
The grounds of expiration of treaties are,
first, expiration of the time for which a treaty was
concluded, and, secondly, occurrence of a resolutive
condition. Of grounds of dissolution of treaties there
are three—namely, mutual consent, withdrawal by
notice, and vital change of circumstances. In contradistinction
to expiration and dissolution as well as to
voidance and cancellation, performance of treaties does
not terminate their binding force. A treaty whose
obligation has been performed is as valid as before,
although it is now of historical interest only.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_901_901"></a><a href="#FNanchor_901_901" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[901]</span></a> The distinction made in the text between fulfilment,
expiration, dissolution, voidance, and cancellation of treaties is, as
far as I know, nowhere sharply drawn, although it would seem to be of
considerable importance. Voidance and cancellation will be discussed
 below, §§ <a href="#A_treaty_although540" class="pginternal">540</a>-544
 and <a href="#A_treaty_although_it_has545" class="pginternal">545</a>-549.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Expiration through Expiration of Time.</p></div>
<p>§ 535. All such treaties as are concluded for a certain
period of time only, expire with the expiration of
such time, unless they are renewed or prolonged for
another period. Such time-expiring treaties are frequently
concluded, and no notice is necessary for their
expirations, except when specially stipulated.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_571">[Pg 571]</a></span></p>
<p>A treaty, however, may be concluded for a certain
period of time only, but with the additional stipulation
that the treaty shall after the lapse of such period be
valid for another such period, unless one of the contracting
parties gives notice in due time.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Expiration through Resolutive Condition.</p></div>
<p>§ 536. Different from time-expiring treaties are such
as are concluded under a resolutive condition, which
means under the condition that they shall at once
expire with the occurrence of certain circumstances.
As soon as these circumstances arise, the treaties expire.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Mutual Consent.</p></div>
<p>§ 537. A treaty, although concluded for ever or for
a period of time which has not yet expired, may nevertheless
always be dissolved by mutual consent of the
contracting parties. Such mutual consent can become
apparent in three different ways.</p>
<p>First, the parties can expressly and purposely declare
that a treaty shall be dissolved; this is rescission.
Or, secondly, they can conclude a new treaty concerning
the same objects as those of a former treaty without
any reference to the latter, although the two treaties
are inconsistent with each other. This is substitution,
and in such a case it is obvious that the treaty previously
concluded was dissolved by tacit mutual consent. Or,
thirdly, if the treaty is such as imposes obligations upon
one of the contracting parties only, the other party
can renounce its rights. Dissolution by renunciation
is a case of dissolution by mutual consent, since acceptance
of the renunciation is necessary.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Withdrawal by Notice.</p></div>
<p>§ 538. Treaties, provided they are not such as are
concluded for ever, may also be dissolved by withdrawal,
after notice by one of the parties. Many
treaties stipulate expressly the possibility of such
withdrawal, and as a rule contain details in regard to
form and period in which notice is to be given for the
purpose of withdrawal. But there are other treaties
which, although they do not expressly stipulate the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_572">[Pg 572]</a></span>
possibility of withdrawal, can nevertheless be dissolved
after notice by one of the contracting parties.
To that class belong all such treaties as are either not
expressly concluded for ever or apparently not intended
to set up an everlasting condition of things.
Thus, for instance, a commercial treaty or a treaty of
alliance not concluded for a fixed period only can always
be dissolved after notice, although such notice be not
expressly stipulated. Treaties, however, which are apparently
intended, or expressly concluded, for the purpose
of setting up an everlasting condition of things, and,
further, treaties concluded for a certain period of time
only, are as a rule not notifiable, although they can be
dissolved by mutual consent of the contracting parties.</p>
<p>It must be emphasised that all treaties of peace and
all boundary treaties belong to this class. It cannot
be denied that history records many cases in which
treaties of peace have not established an everlasting
condition of things, since one or both of the contracting
States took up arms again as soon as they recovered
from the exhausting effect of the previous war.
But this does not prove either that such treaties can
be dissolved through giving notice, or that, at any rate
as far as International Law is concerned, they are not
intended to create an everlasting condition of things.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Vital Change of Circumstances.</p></div>
<p>§ 539. <a id="Although_as_just_stated539"></a>Although, as just stated, treaties concluded
for a certain period of time, and such treaties as are
apparently intended or expressly contracted for the
purpose of setting up an everlasting condition of things,
cannot in principle be dissolved by withdrawal of one
of the parties, there is an exception to this rule. For
it is an almost universally recognised fact that vital
changes of circumstances may be of such a kind as to
justify a party in notifying an unnotifiable treaty.
The vast majority of publicists, as well as all the Governments
of the members of the Family of Nations, defend<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_573">[Pg 573]</a></span>
the principle <i>Conventio omnis intelligitur rebus sic
stantibus</i>, and they agree,<a id="FNanchor_902_902"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_902_902">[902]</a> therefore, that all treaties
are concluded under the tacit condition <i>rebus sic stantibus</i>.
That this condition involves a certain amount of
danger cannot be denied, for it can be, and indeed
sometimes has been, abused for the purpose of hiding
the violation of treaties behind the shield of law, and
of covering shameful wrong with the mantle of righteousness.
But all this cannot alter the fact that this exceptional
condition is as necessary for International
law and international intercourse as the very rule
<i>pacta sunt servanda</i>. When, for example, the existence
or the necessary development of a State stands in
unavoidable conflict with such State's treaty obligations,
the latter must give way, for self-preservation
and development in accordance with the growth and
the necessary requirements of the nation are the primary
duties of every State. No State would consent to any
such treaty as would hinder it in the fulfilment of
these primary duties. The consent of a State to a
treaty presupposes a conviction that such treaty is not
fraught with danger to its existence and development,
and implies a condition that, if by an unforeseen change
of circumstances the obligations stipulated in the treaty
should imperil the said State's existence and necessary
development, the treaty, although by its nature unnotifiable,
should nevertheless be notifiable.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_902_902"></a><a href="#FNanchor_902_902" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[902]</span></a> See
 Bonucci in Z.V. IV. (1910), pp. 449-471. Many writers
agree to it with great reluctance only and in a very limited sense, as,
for instance, Grotius, II. c. 16, § 25, No. 2; Vattel, II. § 296;
Klüber, § 165. Some few writers, however, disagree altogether, as, for
instance, Bynkershoek, "Quest. jur. public.," II. c. 10, and Wildman,
"Institutes of International Law," I. (1849), p. 175. Schmidt, op. cit.
pp. 97-118, would seem to reject the <i>clausula</i> altogether, but can
nevertheless not help recognising it in the end. A good survey of the
practice of the States in the matter during the nineteenth century is
given by Kaufmann, op. cit. pp. 12-37.</p></div>
<p>The danger of the clause <i>rebus sic stantibus</i> is to be
found in the elastic meaning of the term "vital changes
of circumstances," as, after all, a State must in every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_574">[Pg 574]</a></span>
special case judge for itself whether or no there is a
vital change of circumstances justifying its withdrawal
from an unnotifiable treaty. On the other hand, the
danger is counterbalanced by the fact that the frequent
and unjustifiable use of the clause <i>rebus sic stantibus</i> by
a State would certainly destroy all its credit among the
nations.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, it is generally agreed that certainly
not every change of circumstances justifies a State
in making use of the clause. All agree that, although
treaty obligations may through a change of circumstances
become disagreeable, burdensome, and onerous,
they must nevertheless be discharged. All agree,
further, that a change of government and even a change
in the form of a State, such as the turning of a monarchy
into a republic and <i>vice versa</i>, does not alone and in
itself justify a State in notifying such a treaty as is by
its nature unnotifiable. On the other hand, all agree
in regard to many cases in which the clause <i>rebus sic
stantibus</i> could justly be made use of. Thus, for example,
if a State enters into a treaty of alliance for a
certain period of time, and if before the expiration of
the alliance a change of circumstances occurs, so that
now the alliance endangers the very existence of one
of the contracting parties, all will agree that the clause
<i>rebus sic stantibus</i> would justify such party in notifying
the treaty of alliance.</p>
<p>A certain amount of disagreement as to the cases
in which the clause might or might not be justly applied
will of course always remain. But the fact is
remarkable that during the nineteenth century not
many cases of the application of the clause have occurred.
And the States and public opinion everywhere
have come to the conviction that the clause <i>rebus sic
stantibus</i> ought not to give the right to a State at once to
liberate itself from the obligations of a treaty, but only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_575">[Pg 575]</a></span>
the claim to be released from these obligations by the
other parties to the treaty. Accordingly, when a State
is of the opinion that the obligations of a treaty have
through a vital change of circumstances become unbearable,
it should first approach the other party or parties
and request them to abrogate the treaty. And it is only
when such abrogation is refused that a State may
perhaps be justified in declaring that it could no longer
consider itself bound by the obligations concerned.
Thus, when, in 1870, during the Franco-German War,
Russia declared her withdrawal from such stipulations
of the Treaty of Paris of 1856 as concerned the neutralisation
of the Black Sea and the restriction imposed
upon Russia in regard to men-of-war in that sea, Great
Britain protested, and a conference was held in London
in 1871. Although by a treaty signed on March 13,
1871, this conference, consisting of the signatory Powers
of the Treaty of Paris—namely, Austria, England,
France, Germany, Italy, Russia, and Turkey—complied
with the wishes of Russia and abolished the neutralisation
of the Black Sea, it adopted in a protocol<a id="FNanchor_903_903"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_903_903">[903]</a> of
January 17, 1871, the following declaration:—"Que
c'est un principe essentiel du droit des gens qu'aucune
Puissance ne peut se délier des engagements d'un
traité, ni en modifier les stipulations, qu'à la suite de
l'assentiment des parties contractantes, au moyen d'une
entente amicale."</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_903_903"></a><a href="#FNanchor_903_903" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[903]</span></a> See
 Martens, N.R.G. XVIII. p. 278.</p></div>
<p>In spite of this declaration, signed also by herself,
Russia in 1886 notified her withdrawal from article 59
of the Treaty of Berlin of 1878 stipulating the freedom
of the port of Batoum.<a id="FNanchor_904_904"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_904_904">[904]</a> The signatory Powers of the
Treaty of Berlin seem to have tacitly consented, with
the exception of Great Britain, which protested. Again,
in October 1908, Austria-Hungary, in defiance of article<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_576">[Pg 576]</a></span>
25 of the Treaty of Berlin, 1878, proclaimed her sovereignty
over Bosnia and Herzegovina, which hitherto
had been under her occupation and administration,
and simultaneously Bulgaria, in defiance of article 1
of the same treaty, declared herself independent.<a id="FNanchor_905_905"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_905_905">[905]</a>
Thus the standard value of the Declaration of the Conference
of London of 1871 has become doubtful again.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_904_904"></a><a href="#FNanchor_904_904" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[904]</span></a> See
 Martens, N.R.G. 2nd Ser. XIV. p. 170, and
Rolin-Jaequemyns in R.I. XIX. (1887), pp. 37-49.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_905_905"></a><a href="#FNanchor_905_905" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[905]</span></a> See

606; and Blociszewski in R.G. XVII. (1910), pp. 417-449. There is hardly
any doubt that, if Austria-Hungary had not ignored the above-mentioned
Declaration contained in the protocol of January 17, 1871, and had
approached the Powers in the matter, the abrogation of article 25 of the
Treaty of Berlin would have been granted and she would have been allowed
to annex Bosnia and Herzegovina after having indemnified Turkey. This is
to be inferred from the fact that, when Austria-Hungary proclaimed her
sovereignty over the provinces, Turkey accepted compensation, and the
Powers, which first had protested and demanded an international
conference, consented to the abrogation of the Treaty of Berlin.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_906_906"></a><a href="#FNanchor_906_906" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[906]</span></a> But such voidance must not be confounded with the voidance

such State as succeeds to the extinct State. That
some treaties devolve upon the successor has been
shown above (§ <a href="#When_a_State_merges82" class="pginternal">82</a>), but many treaties do not. On<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_577">[Pg 577]</a></span>
this ground all political treaties, such as treaties of

void.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Impossibility of Execution.</p></div>
<p>§ 542. <a id="All_treaties_whose542"></a>All treaties whose execution becomes impossible
subsequent to their conclusion are thus
rendered void. A frequently quoted example is that
of three States concluding a treaty of alliance and
subsequent war breaking out between two of the contracting

third party to execute the treaty, and it becomes void.<a id="FNanchor_907_907"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_907_907">[907]</a>
It must, however, be added that the impossibility of
execution may be temporary only, and that then the

</h4>
<p class="indh1">See the literature quoted at the commencement of § <a href="#The_binding_force_of534" class="pginternal">534</a>.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Grounds of Cancellation.</p></div>
<p>§ 545. <a id="A_treaty_although_it_has545"></a>A treaty, although it has neither expired,
nor been dissolved, nor become void, may nevertheless
lose its binding force by cancellation. The causes of
cancellation are four—namely, inconsistency with International
Law created subsequent to the conclusion of
the treaty, violation by one of the contracting parties,
subsequent change of status of one of them, and war.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Inconsistency with subsequent International Law.</p></div>
<p>§ 546. Just as treaties have no binding force when
concluded with reference to an illegal object, so they
lose their binding force when through a progressive
development of International Law they become inconsistent
with the latter. Through the abolition of privateering
among the signatory Powers of the Declaration
of Paris of 1856, for example, all treaties between
any of these Powers based on privateering as a recognised
institution of International Law were <i>ipso facto</i>
cancelled.<a id="FNanchor_908_908"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_908_908">[908]</a> But it must be emphasised that subsequent
Municipal Law can certainly have no such influence
upon existing treaties. On occasions, indeed, subsequent
Municipal Law creates for a State a conflict
between its treaty obligations and such law. In such
case this State must endeavour to obtain a release by
the other contracting party from these obligations.<a id="FNanchor_909_909"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_909_909">[909]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_908_908"></a><a href="#FNanchor_908_908" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[908]</span></a> This must be maintained in spite of the fact that Protocol
No. 24—see Martens, N.R.G. XV. (1857), pp. 768-769—contains the
following: "Sur une observation faite par M.M. les Plénipotentiaires de
la Russie, le Congrès reconnaît que la présente résolution, ne pouvant
avoir d'effet retroactif, ne saurait invalider les Conventions
antérieures." This expression of opinion can only mean that previous
treaties with such States as were not and would not become parties to
the Declaration of Paris are not <i>ipso facto</i> cancelled by the
Declaration.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_909_909"></a><a href="#FNanchor_909_909" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[909]</span></a> That Municipal Courts must apply the subsequent Municipal
Law although it conflicts with previous treaty obligations, there is no
doubt, as has been pointed out above, § <a href="#If_the_Law21" class="pginternal">21</a>. See The Cherokee Tobacco, 11
Wall 616; Whitney <i>v.</i> Robertson, 124 United States 190; Botiller <i>v.</i>
Dominguez, 130 United States 238. See also Moore, V. § 774.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_579">[Pg 579]</a></span></p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Violation by one of the Contracting Parties.</p></div>
<p>§ 547. <a id="Vi547"></a>Violation of a treaty by one of the contracting
States does not <i>ipso facto</i> cancel such treaty, but it
is in the discretion of the other party to cancel it on
the ground of violation. There is no unanimity among
writers on International Law in regard to this point,
in so far as a minority makes a distinction between
essential and non-essential stipulations of the treaty,
and maintains that violation of essential stipulations
only creates a right for the other party to cancel the
treaty. But the majority of writers rightly oppose
this distinction, maintaining that it is not always
possible to distinguish essential from non-essential
stipulations, that the binding force of a treaty protects
non-essential stipulations as well as essential ones,
and that it is for the faithful party to consider for
itself whether violation of a treaty, even in its least
essential parts, justifies the cancelling of the treaty.
The case, however, is different when a treaty expressly
stipulates that it should not be considered broken by
violation of merely one or another part of it. And it
must be emphasised that the right to cancel the treaty
on the ground of its violation must be exercised within
a reasonable time after the violation has become known.
If the Power possessing such right does not exercise it
in due time, it must be taken for granted that such right
has been waived. A mere protest, such as the protest of
England in 1886 when Russia withdrew from article
59 of the Treaty of Berlin of 1878, which stipulated
the freedom of the port of Batoum, neither constitutes
a cancellation nor reserves the right of cancellation.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Subsequent Change of Status of one of the Contracting
Parties.</p></div>
<p>§ 548. <a id="A_cause_which548"></a>A cause which <i>ipso facto</i> cancels treaties is
such subsequent change of status of one of the contracting
States as transforms it into a dependency of
another State. As everything depends upon the merits
of each case, no general rule can be laid down as regards
the question when such change of status must be considered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_580">[Pg 580]</a></span>
to have taken place, or, further, as regards
the other question as to the kind of treaties cancelled
by such change.<a id="FNanchor_910_910"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_910_910">[910]</a> Thus, for example, when a State
becomes a member of a Federal State, it is obvious that
all its treaties of alliance are <i>ipso facto</i> cancelled, for in
a Federal State the power of making war rests with the
Federal State, and not with the several members. And
the same is valid as regards a hitherto full-Sovereign
State which comes under the suzerainty of another
State. On the other hand, a good many treaties retain
their binding force in spite of such a change in the
status of a State, all such treaties, namely, as concern
matters in regard to which the State has not lost its
sovereignty through the change. For instance, if the
constitution of a Federal State stipulates that the
matter of extradition remains fully in the competence
of the member-States, all treaties of extradition of members
concluded with third States previous to their
becoming members of the Federal State retain their
binding force.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Renewal of Treaties.</p></div>
<p>§ 550. Renewal of treaties is the term for the prolongation
of such treaties before their expiration as were
concluded for a definite period of time only. Renewal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_581">[Pg 581]</a></span>
can take place through a new treaty, and the old treaty
may then be renewed as a body or in parts only. But
the renewal can also take place automatically, many
treaties concluded for a certain period stipulating expressly
that they are considered renewed for another
period in case neither of the contracting parties has
given notice.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Reconfirmation.</p></div>
<p>§ 551. Reconfirmation is the term for the express
statement made in a new treaty that a certain previous
treaty, whose validity has or might have become doubtful,
is still, and remains, valid. Reconfirmation takes
place after such changes of circumstances as might be
considered to interfere with the validity of a treaty;
for instance, after a war, as regards such treaties as
have not been cancelled by the outbreak of war. Reconfirmation
can be given to the whole of a previous
treaty or to parts of it only. Sometimes reconfirmation
is given in this very precise way, that a new treaty
stipulates that a previous treaty shall be incorporated
in itself. It must be emphasised that in such a case
those parties to the new treaty which have not been
parties to the previous treaty do not now become so
by its reconfirmation, the latter applying to the previous
contracting parties only.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Redintegration.</p></div>
<p>§ 552. Treaties which have lost their binding force
through expiration or cancellation may regain it through
redintegration. A treaty becomes redintegrated by the
mutual consent of the contracting parties regularly
given in a new treaty. Thus it is usual for treaties of
peace to redintegrate all those treaties cancelled through
the outbreak of war whose stipulations the contracting
parties do not want to alter.</p>
<p>Without doubt, redintegration does not necessarily
take place exclusively by a treaty, as theoretically it must
be considered possible for the contracting parties tacitly
to redintegrate an expired or cancelled treaty by a line<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_582">[Pg 582]</a></span>
of conduct which indicates apparently their intention
to redintegrate the treaty. However, I do not know of
any instance of such tacit redintegration.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Authentic Interpretation, and the Compromise Clause.</p></div>
<p>§ 553. <a id="Ne553"></a>Neither customary nor conventional rules of
International Law exist concerning interpretation of
treaties. Grotius and the later authorities applied the
rules of Roman Law respecting interpretation in general
to interpretation of treaties. On the whole, such application
is correct in so far as those rules of Roman
Law are full of common sense. But it must be emphasised
that interpretation of treaties is in the first instance
a matter of consent between the contracting
parties. If they choose a certain interpretation, no
other has any basis. It is only when they disagree that
an interpretation based on scientific grounds can ask
a hearing. And these scientific grounds can be no
other than those provided by jurisprudence. The best
means of settling questions of interpretation, provided
the parties cannot come to terms, is arbitration, as the
appointed arbitrators will apply the general rules of
jurisprudence. Now in regard to interpretation given
by the parties themselves, there are two different ways
open to them. They may either agree informally upon
the interpretation and execute the treaty accordingly;
or they may make an additional new treaty and stipulate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_583">[Pg 583]</a></span>
therein such interpretation of the previous treaty
as they choose. In the latter case one speaks of
"authentic" interpretation in analogy with the authentic
interpretation of Municipal Law given expressly
by a statute. Nowadays treaties very often contain
the so-called "compromise clause" as regards interpretation—namely,
the clause that, in case the parties
should not agree on questions of interpretation, these
questions shall be settled by arbitration. Italy and
Switzerland regularly endeavour to insert that clause
in their treaties.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Rules of Interpretation which recommend themselves.</p></div>
<p>§ 554. <a id="It554"></a>It is of importance to enumerate some rules
of interpretation<a id="FNanchor_911_911"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_911_911">[911]</a> which recommend themselves on
account of their suitability.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_911_911"></a><a href="#FNanchor_911_911" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[911]</span></a> The whole matter of interpretation of treaties is dealt
with in an admirable way by Phillimore, II. §§ 64-95; see also Moore, V.
§ 763, and Wharton, II. § 133.</p></div>
<p>(1) All treaties must be interpreted according to
their reasonable in contradistinction to their literal
sense. An excellent example illustrating this rule is
the following, which is quoted by several writers:—In
the interest of Great Britain the Treaty of Peace of
Utrecht of 1713 stipulated in its article 9 that the port
and the fortifications of Dunkirk should be destroyed
and never be rebuilt. France complied with this
stipulation, but at the same time began building an
even larger port at Mardyck, a league off Dunkirk.
Great Britain protested on the ground that France in
so acting was violating the reasonable, although not
the literal, sense of the Peace of Utrecht, and France
in the end recognised this interpretation and discontinued
the building of the new port.</p>
<p>(2) The terms used in a treaty must be interpreted
according to their usual meaning in the language of
every-day life, provided they are not expressly used in
a certain technical meaning or another meaning is not
apparent from the context.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_584">[Pg 584]</a></span></p>
<p>(3) It is taken for granted that the contracting
parties intend something reasonable, something adequate
to the purpose of the treaty, and something not inconsistent
with generally recognised principles of International
Law nor with previous treaty obligations towards
third States. If, therefore, the meaning of a
stipulation is ambiguous, the reasonable meaning is
to be preferred to the unreasonable, the more reasonable
to the less reasonable, the adequate meaning to the
meaning not adequate for the purpose of the treaty,
the consistent meaning to the meaning inconsistent
with generally recognised principles of International
Law and with previous treaty obligations towards third
States.</p>
<p>(4) The principle <i>in dubio mitius</i> must be applied in
interpreting treaties. If, therefore, the meaning of a
stipulation is ambiguous, such meaning is to be preferred
as is less onerous for the obliged party, or as
interferes less with the parties' territorial and personal
supremacy, or as contains less general restrictions upon
the parties.</p>
<p>(5) Previous treaties between the same parties, and
treaties between one of the parties and third parties,
may be alluded to for the purpose of clearing up the
meaning of a stipulation.</p>
<p>(6) If there is a discrepancy between the clear
meaning of a stipulation, on the one hand, and, on the
other, the intentions of one of the parties declared
during the negotiations preceding the signing of a
treaty, the decision must depend on the merits of the
special case. If, for instance, the discrepancy was
produced through a mere clerical error or by some other
kind of mistake, it is obvious that an interpretation is
necessary in accordance with the real intentions of the
contracting parties.</p>
<p>(7) <a id="In7of554"></a>In case of a discrepancy between the clear<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_585">[Pg 585]</a></span>
meaning of a stipulation, on the one hand, and, on the
other, the intentions of all the parties unanimously declared
during the negotiations preceding the signing of
the treaty, the meaning which corresponds to the real
intentions of the parties must prevail over the meaning
of the text. If, therefore—as in the case of the Declaration
of London of 1909—the Report of the Drafting
Committee contains certain interpretations and is unanimously
accepted as authoritative by all the negotiators
previous to the signing of the treaty, their interpretations
must prevail.</p>
<p>(8) If two meanings of a stipulation are admissible
according to the text of a treaty, such meaning is to
prevail as the party proposing the stipulation knew at
the time to be the meaning preferred by the party
accepting it.</p>
<p>(9) <a id="If_it_is_a_matter_of_common_knowledge9of554"></a>If it is a matter of common knowledge that a
State upholds a meaning which is different from the
generally prevailing meaning of a term, and if nevertheless
another State enters into a treaty with the former
in which such term is made use of, such meaning must
prevail as is upheld by the former. If, for instance,
States conclude commercial treaties with the United
States of America in which the most-favoured-nation
clause<a id="FNanchor_912_912"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_912_912">[912]</a> occurs, the particular meaning which the United
States attribute to this clause must prevail.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_912_912"></a><a href="#FNanchor_912_912" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[912]</span></a> See
 below, § <a href="#Most_of_the_commercial580" class="pginternal">580</a>.</p></div>
<p>(10) If the meaning of a stipulation is ambiguous
and one of the contracting parties, at a time before a
case arises for the application of the stipulation, makes
known what meaning it attributes to the stipulation,
the other party or parties cannot, when a case for the
application of the stipulation occurs, insist upon a
different meaning. They ought to have previously protested
and taken the necessary steps to secure an
authentic interpretation of the ambiguous stipulation.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_586">[Pg 586]</a></span>
Thus, when in 1911 it became obvious that Germany
and other continental States attributed to article 23(<i>h</i>)
of the Hague Regulations respecting the Laws and
Usages of War on Land a meaning different from the
one preferred by Great Britain, the British Foreign
Office made the British interpretation of this article
known.</p>
<p>(11) It is to be taken for granted that the parties
intend the stipulations of a treaty to have a certain
effect and not to be meaningless. Therefore, such
interpretation is not admissible as would make a stipulation
meaningless or inefficient.</p>
<p>(12) All treaties must be interpreted so as to exclude
fraud and so as to make their operation consistent
with good faith.</p>
<p>(13) The rules commonly applied by the Courts as
regards the interpretation and construction of Municipal
Laws are in so far only applicable to the interpretation
and construction of treaties, and in especial
of law-making treaties, as they are general rules of
jurisprudence. If, however, they are particular rules,
sanctioned only by the Municipal Law or by the practice
of the Courts of a particular country, they may not
be applied.</p>
<p>(14) If a treaty is concluded in two languages, for
instance, a treaty between Great Britain and France
in English and French, and if there is a discrepancy
between the meaning of the two different texts, each
party is only bound by the text of its own language.
But a party cannot claim any advantage from the
text of the language of the other party.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_587">[Pg 587]</a></span></p>

<p>§ 555. <a id="La555"></a>Law-making treaties<a id="FNanchor_913_913"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_913_913">[913]</a> have been concluded
ever since International Law came into existence. It was
not until the nineteenth century, however, that such law-making
treaties existed as are of world-wide importance.
Although at the Congress at Münster and Osnabrück
all the then existing European Powers, with the exception
of Great Britain, Russia, and Poland, were represented,
the Westphalian Peace of 1648, to which France,
Sweden, and the States of the German Empire were
parties, and which recognised the independence of
Switzerland and the Netherlands, on the one hand, and,
on the other, the practical sovereignty of the then existing
355 States of the German Empire, was not of world-wide
importance, in spite of the fact that it contains
various law-making stipulations. And the same may
be said with regard to all other treaties of peace between
1648 and 1815. The first law-making treaty of world-wide
importance was the Final Act of the Vienna Congress,
1815, and the last, as yet, is the Declaration of
London of 1909. But it must be particularly noted
that not all of these are <i>pure</i> law-making treaties, since
many contain other stipulations besides those which
are law-making.</p>

Russia, Sardinia, and Turkey, is a pure law-making
treaty of the greatest importance, stipulating four rules
with regard to sea warfare—namely, that privateering
is abolished; that the neutral flag covers enemy goods
with the exception of contraband of war; that neutral
goods, contraband excepted, cannot be confiscated even
when sailing under the enemy flag; that a blockade
must be effective to be binding.</p>

and that of July 6, 1906, are pure law-making treaties
for the amelioration of the conditions of the wounded
of armies in the field. The Geneva Convention of 1864
was originally signed only by Switzerland, Baden, Belgium,
Denmark, France, Holland, Italy, Prussia, and
Spain, but in time all other civilised States have acceded
except Costa Rica, Lichtenstein, and Monaco. A
treaty<a id="FNanchor_919_919"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_919_919">[919]</a> containing articles additional to the Geneva
Convention of 1864 was signed at Geneva on October 20,
1868, but was not ratified. A better fate was in store
for the Geneva Convention<a id="FNanchor_920_920"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_920_920">[920]</a> of 1906, which was signed
by the delegates of thirty-five States, many of which
have already granted ratification. Colombia, Costa Rica,
Cuba, Nicaragua, Turkey, and Venezuela have already
acceded. It is of importance to emphasise that the
Convention of 1864 is not entirely replaced by the Convention
of 1906, in so far as the former remains in force
between those Powers which are parties to it without
being parties to the latter. And it must be remembered
that the Final Act of the First as well as of the Second
Peace Conference contains a convention for the adaptation
to sea warfare of the principles of the Geneva
Convention.</p>

of July 29, 1899, was a pure law-making treaty comprising
three separate conventions—namely, a convention
for the peaceful adjustment of international differences,
a convention concerning the law of land warfare,
and a convention for the adaptation to maritime
warfare of the principles of the Geneva Convention of
1864,—and three Declarations—namely, a Declaration
prohibiting, for a term of five years, the discharge of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_592">[Pg 592]</a></span>
projectiles and explosives from balloons, a Declaration
concerning the prohibition of the use of projectiles the
only object of which is the diffusion of asphyxiating or
deleterious gases, and a Declaration concerning the
prohibition of so-called dum-dum bullets. All these
conventions, however, and the first of these declarations
have been replaced by the General Act of the Second
Hague Peace Conference, and only the last two declarations
are still in force. All the States which were represented
at the Conference are now parties to these

<div class="sidenote"><p>Conception of Alliances.</p></div>
<p>§ 569. <a id="Alliances_in_the_strict569"></a>Alliances in the strict sense of the term are
treaties of union between two or more States for the
purpose of defending each other against an attack in
war, or of jointly attacking third States, or for both
purposes. The term "alliance" is, however, often
made use of in a wider sense, and it comprises in such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_596">[Pg 596]</a></span>
cases treaties of union for various purposes. Thus, the
so-called "Holy Alliance," concluded in 1815 between
the Emperors of Austria and Russia and the King of
Prussia, and afterwards joined by almost all of the
Sovereigns of Europe, was a union for such vague purposes
that it cannot be called an alliance in the strict
sense of the term.</p>
<p>History relates innumerable alliances between the
several States. They have always played, and still
play, an important part in politics. At the present time
the triple alliance between Germany, Austria, and Italy
since 1879 and 1882, the alliance between Russia and
France since 1899, and that between Great Britain
and Japan since 1902, renewed in 1905 and 1911, are
illustrative examples.<a id="FNanchor_935_935"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_935_935">[935]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_935_935"></a><a href="#FNanchor_935_935" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[935]</span></a> The following is the text of the Anglo-Japanese treaty of
Alliance of 1911:—
</p><p>
The Government of Great Britain and the Government of Japan, having in
view the important changes which have taken place in the situation since
the conclusion of the Anglo-Japanese agreement of the 12th August 1905,
and believing that a revision of that Agreement responding to such
changes would contribute to general stability and repose, have agreed
upon the following stipulations to replace the Agreement above
mentioned, such stipulations having the same object as the said
Agreement, namely:—
</p><p>
(<i>a</i>) The consolidation and maintenance of the general peace in the
regions of Eastern Asia and of India;
</p><p>
(<i>b</i>) The preservation of the common interests of all Powers in China by
insuring the independence and integrity of the Chinese Empire and the
principle of equal opportunities for the commerce and industry of all
nations in China;
</p><p>
(<i>c</i>) The maintenance of the territorial rights of the High Contracting
Parties in the regions of Eastern Asia and of India, and the defence of
their special interests in the said regions:—
</p><p>
<span class="smcap">Article I.</span>
</p><p>
It is agreed that whenever, in the opinion of either Great Britain or
Japan, any of the rights and interests referred to in the preamble of
this Agreement are in jeopardy, the two Governments will communicate
with one another fully and frankly, and will consider in common the
measures which should be taken to safeguard those menaced rights or
interests.
</p><p>
<span class="smcap">Article II.</span>
</p><p>
If by reason of unprovoked attack or aggressive action, wherever
arising, on the part of any Power or Powers, either High Contracting
Party should be involved in war in defence of its territorial rights or
special interests mentioned in the preamble of this Agreement, the other
High Contracting Party will at once come to the assistance of its ally,
and will conduct the war in common, and make peace in mutual agreement
with it.
</p><p>
<span class="smcap">Article III.</span>
</p><p>
The High Contracting Parties agree that neither of them will, without
consulting the other, enter into separate arrangements with another
Power to the prejudice of the objects described in the preamble of this
Agreement.
</p><p>
<span class="smcap">Article IV.</span>
</p><p>
Should either High Contracting Party conclude a treaty of general
arbitration with a third Power, it is agreed that nothing in this
Agreement shall entail upon such Contracting Party an obligation to go
to war with the Power with whom such treaty of arbitration is in force.
</p><p>
<span class="smcap">Article V.</span>
</p><p>
The conditions under which armed assistance shall be afforded by either
Power to the other in the circumstances mentioned in the present
Agreement, and the means by which such assistance is to be made
available, will be arranged by the Naval and Military authorities of the
High Contracting Parties, who will from time to time consult one another
fully and freely upon all questions of mutual interest.
</p><p>
<span class="smcap">Article VI.</span>
</p><p>
The present Agreement shall come into effect immediately after the date
of its signature, and remain in force for ten years from that date.
</p><p>
In case neither of the High Contracting Parties should have notified
twelve months before the expiration of the said ten years the intention
of terminating it, it shall remain binding until the expiration of one
year from the day on which either of the High Contracting Parties shall
have denounced it. But if, when the date fixed for its expiration
arrives, either ally is actually engaged in war, the alliance shall,
<i>ipso facto</i>, continue until peace is concluded.
</p><p>
In faith whereof the undersigned, duly authorised by their respective
Governments, have signed this Agreement, and have affixed thereto their
Seals.

<div class="sidenote"><p>Parties to Alliance.</p></div>
<p>§ 570. <a id="Subjects_of_alliances570"></a>Subjects of alliances are said to be full-Sovereign
States only. But the fact cannot be denied
that alliances have been concluded by States under
suzerainty. Thus, the convention of April 16, 1877,
between Roumania, which was then under Turkish
suzerainty, and Russia, concerning the passage of Russian
troops through Roumanian territory in case of war with
Turkey, was practically a treaty of alliance.<a id="FNanchor_936_936"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_936_936">[936]</a> Thus,
further, the former South African Republic, although,
at any rate according to the views of the British
Government, a half-Sovereign State under British
suzerainty, concluded an alliance with the former Orange
Free State by treaty of March 17, 1897.<a id="FNanchor_937_937"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_937_937">[937]</a></p>

<p>A neutralised State can be the subject of an alliance
for the purpose of defence, whereas the entrance into
an offensive alliance on the part of such State would
involve a breach of its neutrality.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Different kinds of Alliances.</p></div>
<p>§ 571. As already mentioned, an alliance may be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_598">[Pg 598]</a></span>
offensive or defensive, or both. All three kinds may be
either general alliances, in which case the allies are
united against any possible enemy whatever, or particular
alliances against one or more individual enemies.
Alliances, further, may be either permanent or temporary,
and in the latter case they expire with the
period of time for which they were concluded. As
regards offensive alliances, it must be emphasised that
they are valid only when their object is not immoral.<a id="FNanchor_938_938"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_938_938">[938]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_938_938"></a><a href="#FNanchor_938_938" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[938]</span></a> See
 above, § <a href="#It_is_a_customarily_recognised505" class="pginternal">505</a>.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Conditions of Alliances.</p></div>
<p>§ 572. Alliances may contain all sorts of conditions.
The most important are the conditions regarding the
assistance to be rendered. It may be that assistance
is to be rendered with the whole or a limited part of
the military and naval forces of the allies, or with the
whole or a limited part of their military or with the
whole or a limited part of their naval forces only.
Assistance may, further, be rendered in money only,
so that one of the allies is fighting with his forces while
the other supplies a certain sum of money for their
maintenance. A treaty of alliance of such a kind
must not be confounded with a simple treaty of subsidy.
If two States enter into a convention that one of the
parties shall furnish the other permanently in time of
peace and war with a limited number of troops in
return for a certain annual payment, such convention
is not an alliance, but a treaty of subsidy only. But
if two States enter into a convention that in case of
war one of the parties shall furnish the other with a
limited number of troops, be it in return for payment
or not, such convention really constitutes an alliance.
For every convention concluded for the purpose of
lending succour in time of war implies an alliance.
It is for this reason that the above-mentioned<a id="FNanchor_939_939"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_939_939">[939]</a> treaty
of 1877 between Russia and Roumania concerning
the passage of Russian troops through Roumanian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_599">[Pg 599]</a></span>
territory in case of war against Turkey was really a
treaty of alliance.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_939_939"></a><a href="#FNanchor_939_939" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[939]</span></a> See
 above, § <a href="#Subjects_of_alliances570" class="pginternal">570</a>.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p><i>Casus Fœderis.</i></p></div>
<p>§ 573. <i><a id="Casus573"></a>Casus fœderis</i> is the event upon the occurrence
of which it becomes the duty of one of the allies
to render the promised assistance to the other. Thus
in case of a defensive alliance the <i>casus fœderis</i> occurs
when war is declared or commenced against one of the
allies. Treaties of alliance very often define precisely
the event which shall be the <i>casus fœderis</i>, and then
the latter is less exposed to controversy. But, on the
other hand, there have been many alliances concluded
without such specialisation, and, consequently, disputes
have arisen later between the parties as to the <i>casus
fœderis</i>.</p>
<p>That the <i>casus fœderis</i> is not influenced by the fact
that a State, subsequent to entering into an alliance,
concludes a treaty of general arbitration with a third
State, has been pointed out above, § <a href="#According_to_the_principle522" class="pginternal">522</a>.</p>

numerous.<a id="FNanchor_940_940"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_940_940">[940]</a> It suffices to give the following chief
examples: the performance of a particular act on
the part of a certain State, as the discharge of a debt
or the cession of a territory; certain rights of a State;
the undisturbed possession of the whole or a particular
part of the territory; a particular form of Constitution;
a certain status, as permanent neutrality<a id="FNanchor_941_941"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_941_941">[941]</a> or independence<a id="FNanchor_942_942"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_942_942">[942]</a>
or integrity<a id="FNanchor_943_943"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_943_943">[943]</a>; a particular dynastic succession;
the fulfilment of a treaty concluded by a third State.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_940_940"></a><a href="#FNanchor_940_940" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[940]</span></a> The important part that treaties of guarantee play in
politics may be seen from a glance at Great Britain's guarantee
treaties. See Munro, "England's Treaties of Guarantee," in <i>The Law

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_942_942"></a><a href="#FNanchor_942_942" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[942]</span></a> Thus Great Britain, France, and Russia have guaranteed, by
the Treaty with Denmark of July 13, 1863, the independence (but also the
monarchy) of Greece (Martens, N.R.G. XVII. Part. II. p. 79). The United
States of America has guaranteed the independence of Cuba by the Treaty
of Havana of May 22, 1903 (Martens, N.R.G. 2nd Ser. XXXII. p. 79), and
of Panama by the Treaty of Washington of November 18, 1903 (Martens,
N.R.G. 2nd Ser. XXXI. p. 599).</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_943_943"></a><a href="#FNanchor_943_943" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[943]</span></a> Thus the integrity of Norway is guaranteed by Great
Britain, Germany, France, and Russia by the Treaty of Christiania of
November 2, 1907; see Martens, N.R.G. 3rd Ser. II. p. 9. A condition of
this integrity is that Norway does not cede any part of her territory to
any foreign Power.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Effect of Treaties of Guarantee.</p></div>
<p>§ 575. The effect of guarantee treaties is the creation
of the duty of the guarantors to do what is in their
power in order to secure the guaranteed objects. The
compulsion to be applied by a guarantor for that purpose
depends upon the circumstances; it may eventually
be war. But the duty of the guarantor to render, even
by compulsion, the promised assistance to the guaranteed
depends upon many conditions and circumstances.
Thus, first, the guaranteed must request the guarantor
to render assistance. When, for instance, the possession
of a certain part of its territory is guaranteed
to a State which after its defeat in a war with a third<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_601">[Pg 601]</a></span>
State agrees as a condition of peace to cede such piece
of territory to the victor without having requested the
intervention of the guarantor, the latter has neither a
right nor a duty to interfere. Thus, secondly, the
guarantor must at the critical time be able to render
the required assistance. When, for instance, its hands
are tied through waging war against a third State, or
when it is so weak through internal troubles or other
factors that its interference would expose it to a serious
danger, it is not bound to fulfil the request for assistance.
So too, when the guaranteed has not complied
with previous advice given by the guarantor as to the
line of its behaviour, it is not the guarantor's duty
to render assistance afterwards.</p>
<p>It is impossible to state all the circumstances and
conditions upon which the fulfilment of the duty of the
guarantor depends, as every case must be judged upon
its own merits. And it is certain that, more frequently
than in other cases, changes in political constellations
and the general developments of events may involve
such vital change of circumstances as to justify<a id="FNanchor_944_944"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_944_944">[944]</a> a
State in refusing to interfere in spite of a treaty
of guarantee. It is for this reason that treaties of
guarantee to secure permanently a certain object to a
State are naturally of a more or less precarious value
to the latter. The practical value, therefore, of a
guarantee treaty, whatever may be its formal character,
would as a rule seem to extend to the early years only
of its existence while the original conditions still obtain.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Effect of Collective Guarantee.</p></div>
<p>§ 576. In contradistinction to treaties constituting
a guarantee on the part of one or more States severally,
the effect of treaties constituting a <i>collective</i> guarantee
on the part of several States requires special consideration.
On June 20, 1867, Lord Derby maintained<a id="FNanchor_945_945"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_945_945">[945]</a> in
the House of Lords concerning the collective guarantee<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_602">[Pg 602]</a></span>
by the Powers of the neutralisation of Luxemburg that
in case of a collective guarantee each guarantor had
only the duty to act according to the treaty when all
the other guarantors were ready to act likewise; that,
consequently, if one of the guarantors themselves
should violate the neutrality of Luxemburg, the duty
to act according to the treaty of collective guarantee
would not accrue to the other guarantors. This opinion
is certainly not correct,<a id="FNanchor_946_946"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_946_946">[946]</a> and I do not know of any
publicist who would or could approve of it. There
ought to be no doubt that in a case of collective guarantee
one of the guarantors alone cannot be considered bound
to act according to the treaty of guarantee. For a
collective guarantee can have the meaning only that
the guarantors should act in a body. But if one of the
guarantors themselves violates the object of his own
guarantee, the body of the guarantors remains, and
it is certainly their duty to act against such faithless
co-guarantor. If, however, the majority,<a id="FNanchor_947_947"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_947_947">[947]</a> and therefore
the body of the guarantors, were to violate the
very object of their guarantee, the duty to act against
them would not accrue to the minority.</p>

<p>Different, however, is the case in which a number of
Powers have <i>collectively and severally</i> guaranteed a certain
object. Then, not only as a body but also individually,
it is their duty to interfere in any case of violation of
the object of guarantee.</p>

<p>§ 576<i>a</i>. <a id="Different_from_real576a"></a>Different from real Guarantee Treaties are
such treaties as declare the policy of the parties with
regard to the maintenance of their territorial <i>status quo</i>.
Whereas treaties guaranteeing the maintenance of the
territorial <i>status quo</i> engage the guarantors to do what
they can to maintain such <i>status quo</i>, treaties declaring
the policy of the parties with regard to the maintenance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_603">[Pg 603]</a></span>
of their territorial <i>status quo</i> do not contain any legal
engagements, but simply state the firm resolution of
the parties to uphold the <i>status quo</i>. In contradistinction
to real guarantee treaties, such treaties declaring
the policy of the parties may fitly be called Pseudo-Guarantee
Treaties, and although their political value
is very great, they have scarcely any legal importance.
For the parties do not bind themselves to pursue a
policy for maintaining the <i>status quo</i>, they only declare
their firm resolution to that end. Further, the parties
do not engage themselves to uphold the <i>status quo</i>, but
only to communicate with one another, in case the
<i>status quo</i> is threatened, with a view to agreeing upon
such measures as they may consider advisable for the
maintenance of the <i>status quo</i>. To this class of pseudo-guarantee
treaties belong:—</p>

between France and Spain on the one hand, and, on
the other hand, between Great Britain and Spain, concerning
the territorial <i>status quo</i> in the Mediterranean.
Each party declares that its general policy with regard
to the Mediterranean is directed to the maintenance of
the territorial <i>status quo</i>, and that it is therefore resolved
to preserve intact its rights over its insular and maritime
possessions within the Mediterranean. Each party declares,
further, that, should circumstances arise which
would tend to alter the existing territorial <i>status quo</i>,
it will communicate with the other party in order to
afford it the opportunity to concert, if desired, by
mutual agreement the course of action which the two
parties shall adopt in common.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Commercial Treaties in General.</p></div>
<p>§ 578. <a id="Commercial_treaties578"></a>Commercial treaties are treaties concerning
the commerce and navigation of the contracting States
and concerning the subjects of these States who are
engaged in commerce and navigation. Incidentally, however,
they also contain clauses concerning consuls and
various other matters. They are concluded either for a
limited or an unlimited number of years, and either for
the whole territory of one or either party or only for a
part of such territory—<i>e.g.</i>, by Great Britain for the
United Kingdom alone, or for Canada alone, and the
like. All full-Sovereign States are competent to enter
into commercial treaties, but it depends upon the
special case whether half- and part-Sovereign States are
likewise competent. Although competent to enter upon
commercial treaties, a State may, by an international
compact, be restricted in its freedom with regard to
its commercial policy. Thus, according to articles 1
to 5 of the General Act of the Berlin Congo Conference<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_606">[Pg 606]</a></span>
of February 26, 1885, all the Powers which have possessions
in the Congo district must grant complete freedom
of commerce to all nations. Again, to give another example,
France and Germany are by article 11 of the
Peace of Frankfort of May 10, 1871, compelled to grant
one another most-favoured-nation treatment in their
commercial relations, in so far as favours which they
grant to Great Britain, Belgium, Holland, Switzerland,
Austria, and Russia are concerned.</p>
<p>The details of commercial treaties are for the most
part purely technical and are, therefore, outside the
scope of a general treatise on International Law. There
are, however, two points of great importance which
require discussion—namely, the meaning of coasting
trade and of the most-favoured-nation clause.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Meaning of Coasting Trade in Commercial Treaties.</p></div>
<p>§ 579. <a id="The_meaning_of_the_term579"></a>The meaning of the term coasting-trade<a id="FNanchor_952_952"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_952_952">[952]</a> in
commercial treaties must not be confounded with its
meaning in International Law generally. The meaning
of the term in International Law becomes apparent
through its synonym <i>cabotage</i>—that is, navigation from
cape to cape along the coast combined with trading
between the ports of the coast concerned without going
out into the Open Sea. Therefore, trade between Marseilles
and Nice, between Calais and Havre, between
London and Liverpool, and between Dublin and Belfast
is coasting-trade, but trade between Marseilles and
Havre, and between London and Dublin is not. It is a
universally recognised rule<a id="FNanchor_953_953"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_953_953">[953]</a> of International Law that
every littoral State can exclude foreign merchantmen
from the <i>cabotage</i> within its maritime belt. Cabotage
is the contrast to the over-sea<a id="FNanchor_954_954"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_954_954">[954]</a> carrying trade, and has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_607">[Pg 607]</a></span>
nothing to do with the question of free trade from or
to a port on the coast to or from a port abroad. This
question is one of commercial policy, and International
Law does not prevent a State from restricting to
vessels of its subjects the export from or the import
to its ports, or from allowing such export or import
under certain conditions only.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_952_952"></a><a href="#FNanchor_952_952" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[952]</span></a> See
 Oppenheim in <i>The Law Quarterly Review</i>, XXIV. (1908),
pp. 328-334.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_953_953"></a><a href="#FNanchor_953_953" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[953]</span></a> See
 above, § <a href="#Theory_and_practice_agree187" class="pginternal">187</a>.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_954_954"></a><a href="#FNanchor_954_954" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[954]</span></a> It must be emphasised that navigation and trade from abroad
to several ports of the same coast successively—for instance, from
Dover to Calais and then to Havre—is not coasting-trade but over-sea
trade, provided that all the passengers and cargo are shipped from
abroad.</p></div>
<p>There is no doubt that originally the meaning of
coasting-trade in commercial treaties was identical with
its meaning in International Law generally, but there
is likewise no doubt that the practice of the States
gives now a much more extended meaning to the term
coasting-trade as used in commercial treaties. Thus
France distinguishes between cabotage <i>petit</i> and <i>grand</i>;
whereas <i>petit</i> cabotage is coasting-trade between ports
in the same sea, <i>grand</i> cabotage is coasting-trade between
a French port situated in the Atlantic Ocean and
a French port situated in the Mediterranean, and—according
to a statute of September 21, 1793—both
<i>grand</i> and <i>petit</i> cabotage are exclusively reserved for
French vessels. Thus, further, the United States of
America has always considered trade between one of
her ports in the Atlantic Ocean and one in the Pacific
to be coasting-trade, and has exclusively reserved it for
vessels of her own subjects; she considers such trade
coasting-trade even when the carriage takes place not
exclusively by sea around Cape Horn, but partly by
sea and partly by land through the Isthmus of Panama.
Great Britain has taken up a similar attitude. Section
2 of the Navigation Act of 1849 (12 &amp; 13 Vict. c. 29)
enacted "that no goods or passengers shall be carried
<i>coastwise</i> from one part of the United Kingdom to another,
or from the Isle of Man to the United Kingdom,
except in British ships," and thereby declared trade
between a port of England or Scotland to a port of Ireland
or the Isle of Man to be coasting-trade exclusively<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_608">[Pg 608]</a></span>
reserved for British ships in spite of the fact that the
Open Sea flows between these ports. And although
the Navigation Act of 1849 is no longer in force, and
this country now does admit foreign ships to its coasting-trade,
it nevertheless still considers all trade between
one port of the United Kingdom and another to be
coasting-trade, as becomes apparent from Section 140
of the Customs Laws Consolidation Act of July 24, 1876
(39 &amp; 40 Vict. c. 36). Again, Germany declared by a
statute of May 22, 1881, coasting-trade to be trade
between any two German ports, and reserved it for
German vessels, although vessels of such States can be admitted
as on their part admit German vessels to their own
coasting-trade. Thus trade between Koenigsberg in the
Baltic and Hamburg in the North Sea is coasting-trade.</p>
<p>These instances are sufficient to demonstrate that
an extension of the original meaning of coasting-trade
has really taken place and has found general recognition.
A great many commercial treaties have been
concluded between such countries as established that
extension of meaning and others, and these commercial
treaties no doubt make use of the term coasting-trade
in this its extended meaning. It must, therefore, be
maintained that the term coasting-trade or cabotage as
used in commercial treaties has acquired the following
meaning: <i>Sea-trade between any two ports of the same
country whether on the same coast or different coasts,
provided always that the different coasts are all of them
the coasts of one and the same country as a political and
geographical unit in contradistinction to the coasts of
Colonial dependencies of such country</i>.</p>
<p>In spite of this established extension of the term
coasting-trade, it did not include colonial trade until
nearly the end of the nineteenth century.<a id="FNanchor_955_955"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_955_955">[955]</a> Indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_609">[Pg 609]</a></span>
when Russia, by <i>ukase</i> of 1897, enacted that trade
between any of her ports should be considered coasting
trade and be reserved for Russian vessels, this did
not comprise a further extension of the conception
of coasting-trade. The reason is that Russia, although
her territory extends over different parts of the globe,
is a political and geographical unit, and there is one
stretch of territory only between St. Petersburg and
Vladivostock. But when, in 1898 and 1899, the United
States of America declared trade between any of her
ports and those of Porto Rico, the Philippines, and the
Hawaiian Islands to be coasting-trade, and consequently
reserved it exclusively for American vessels,
the distinction between coasting-trade and over-sea or
colonial trade fell to the ground. It is submitted that
this American extension of the conception of coasting-trade
as used in her commercial treaties before 1898 is
inadmissible<a id="FNanchor_956_956"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_956_956">[956]</a> and contains a violation of the treaty
rights of the other contracting parties. Should these
parties consent to the American extension of the meaning
of coasting-trade, and should other countries follow
the American lead and apply the term coasting-trade
indiscriminately to trade along their coasts <i>and</i> to
their colonial trade, the meaning of the term would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_610">[Pg 610]</a></span>
then become <i>trade between any two ports which are under
the sovereignty of the same State</i>. The distinction between
coasting-trade and colonial trade would then
become void, and the last trace of the synonymity between
coasting-trade and cabotage would have disappeared.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_955_955"></a><a href="#FNanchor_955_955" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[955]</span></a> See
 details in Oppenheim, loc. cit. pp. 331-332, but it is
of value to draw attention here to a French statute of April 2, 1889.
Whereas a statute of April 9, 1866, had thrown open the trade between
France and Algeria to vessels of all nations, article 1 of the statute
of April 2, 1889, enacts: <i>La navigation entre la France et l'Algérie ne
pourra s'effectuer que sous pavillon français</i>. This French statute does
not, as is frequently maintained, declare the trade between France and
Algeria to be coasting-trade, but it nevertheless reserves such trade
exclusively for French vessels. The French Government, in bringing the
bill before the French Parliament, explained that the statute could not
come into force before February 1, 1892, because art. 2 of the treaty
with Belgium of May 14, 1882, and art. 21 of the treaty with Spain of
February 6, 1882—both treaties to expire on February 1,
1892—stipulated the same treatment for Belgian and Spanish as for
French vessels, <i>cabotage excepted</i>. It is quite apparent that, if
France had declared trade between French and Algerian ports to be
coasting-trade in the meaning of her commercial treaties, the expiration
of the treaties with Belgium and Spain need not have been awaited for
putting the law of April 2, 1889, into force.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_956_956"></a><a href="#FNanchor_956_956" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[956]</span></a> In the case of Huus <i>v.</i> New York and Porto Rico Steamship
Co. (1901), 182 United States 392, the Court was compelled to confirm
the extension of the term coasting-trade to trade between any American
port and Porto Rico, because this extension was recognised by section 9
of the Porto Rican Act, and because in case of a conflict between
Municipal and International Law—see
 above, § <a href="#If_the_Law21" class="pginternal">21</a>—the Courts are bound
to apply their Municipal Law.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Meaning of most-favoured-nation Clause.</p></div>
<p>§ 580. <a id="Most_of_the_commercial580"></a>Most of the commercial treaties of the nineteenth
century contain a stipulation which is characterised
as the most-favoured-nation clause. The wording
of this clause is by no means the same in all treaties,
and its general form has therefore to be distinguished
from several others which are more specialised in their
wording. According to the most-favoured-nation clause
in its general form, all favours which either contracting
party has granted in the past or will grant in the future
to any third State must be granted to the other party.
But the real meaning of this clause in its general form
has ever been controverted since the United States of
America entered into the Family of Nations and began
to conclude commercial treaties embodying the clause.
Whereas in former times the clause was considered
obviously to have the effect of causing all favours
granted to any one State <i>at once and unconditionally</i>
to accrue to all other States having most-favoured-nation
treaties with the grantor, the United States contended
that these favours could accrue to such of the
other States only as <i>fulfilled the same conditions under
which these favours had been allowed to the grantee</i>.
The majority of the commercial treaties of the United
States, therefore, do not contain the most-favoured-nation
clause in its general form, but in what is called
its conditional, qualified, or reciprocal, form. In this form
it stipulates that all favours granted to third States shall
accrue to the other party unconditionally, in case the
favours have been allowed unconditionally to the
grantee, but only under the same compensation, in case<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_611">[Pg 611]</a></span>
they have been granted conditionally. The United
States, however, has always upheld the opinion, and
the supreme Court of the United States has confirmed<a id="FNanchor_957_957"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_957_957">[957]</a>
this interpretation, that, even if a commercial treaty
contains the clause in its general, and not in its qualified,
form, it must always be interpreted as though it were
worded in its qualified form.</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_957_957"></a><a href="#FNanchor_957_957" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[957]</span></a> See
 Bartram <i>v.</i> Robertson, 122 United States 116, and
Whitney <i>v.</i> Robertson, 124 United States 190.</p></div>
<p>Now nobody doubts that according to the qualified
form of the clause a favour granted to any State can
only accrue to other States having most-favoured-nation
treaties with the grantor, provided they fulfil
the same conditions and offer the same compensations
as the grantee. Again, nobody doubts that, if the
clause is worded in its so-called unconditional form
stipulating the accrument of a favour to other States
whether it was allowed to the grantee gratuitously or
conditionally against compensation, all favours granted
to any State accrue immediately and without condition
to all the other States. However, as regards the clause
in its general form, what might, broadly speaking, be
called the European is confronted by the American
interpretation. This American interpretation is, I believe,
unjustifiable, although it is of importance to
mention that two European writers of such authority
as Martens (II. p. 225) and Westlake (I. p. 283) approve
of it.</p>
<p>It has been suggested<a id="FNanchor_958_958"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_958_958">[958]</a> that the controversy should
be brought before the Hague Court of Arbitration, yet
the United States will never consent to this. Those
States which complain of the American interpretation
had therefore better notify their commercial treaties
with the United States and insert in new treaties the
most-favoured-nation clause in such a form as puts
matters beyond all doubt. So much is certain, a State<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_612">[Pg 612]</a></span>
that at present enters upon a commercial treaty with
the United States comprising the clause in its general
form cannot complain<a id="FNanchor_959_959"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_959_959">[959]</a> of the American interpretation,
which, whatever may be its merits, is now a matter of
common knowledge.<a id="FNanchor_960_960"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_960_960">[960]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Object of the Unions.</p></div>
<p>§ 581. The development of international intercourse
has called into existence innumerable treaties for the
purpose of satisfying economic and other non-political
interests of the several States. Each nation concludes
treaties of commerce, of navigation, of extradition,
and of many other kinds with most of the other
nations, and tries in this way, more or less successfully,
to foster its own interests. Many of these interests
are of such a particular character and depend upon such
individual circumstances and conditions that they can
only be satisfied and fostered by special treaties from
time to time concluded by each State with other States.
Yet experience has shown that the several States
have also many non-political interests in common
which can better be satisfied and fostered by a general
treaty between a great number of States than by special<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_613">[Pg 613]</a></span>
treaties singly concluded between the several parties.
Therefore, since the second half of the nineteenth
century, such general treaties have more and more come
into being, and it is certain that their number will in
time increase. Each of these treaties creates what is
called a Union among the contracting parties, since
these parties have united for the purpose of settling
certain subjects in common. The number of States
which are members of these Unions varies, of course,
and whereas some of them will certainly become in
time universal in the same way as the Universal Postal
Union, others will never reach that stage. But all
the treaties which have created these Unions are general
treaties because a lesser or greater number of States
are parties, and these treaties have created so-called
Unions, although the term "Union" is not always
made use of.<a id="FNanchor_961_961"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_961_961">[961]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_961_961"></a><a href="#FNanchor_961_961" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[961]</span></a> A general treatise on Public International Law cannot
attempt to go into the details of these Unions; it is really a matter
for monographs or for a treatise on International Administrative Law,
such as Neumayer's "Internationales Verwaltungsrecht," which is to
comprise three volumes, and of which the first volume appeared in 1910.

<div class="sidenote"><p>Post and Telegraphs.</p></div>
<p>§ 582. <a id="Whereas_previously582"></a>Whereas previously the States severally
concluded treaties concerning postal and telegraphic
arrangements, they entered into Unions for this
purpose during the second part of the nineteenth
century:—</p>
<p>(1) Twenty-one States entered on October 9, 1874,
at Berne, into a general postal convention<a id="FNanchor_962_962"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_962_962">[962]</a> for the
purpose of creating a General Postal Union. This
General turned into the Universal Postal Union through
the Convention of Paris<a id="FNanchor_963_963"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_963_963">[963]</a> of June 1, 1878, to which
thirty States were parties. This convention has several
times been revised by the congresses of the Union,
which have to meet every five years. The last revision
took place at the Congress of Rome, 1906, where, on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_614">[Pg 614]</a></span>
May 26, a new Universal Postal Convention<a id="FNanchor_964_964"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_964_964">[964]</a> was
signed by all the members of the Family of Nations for

concerning the conflict of laws relative to procedure
in civil cases was concluded at the Hague. But this
treaty was replaced by the Convention<a id="FNanchor_1013_1013"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1013_1013">[1013]</a> of the Hague of
July 17, 1905, which is signed by Germany, Austria-Hungary,
Belgium, Denmark, Spain, France, Italy,
Luxemburg, Norway, Holland, Portugal, Roumania,
Russia, Sweden, and Switzerland.</p>

<p>(2) On June 12, 1902, likewise at the Hague, were
signed three conventions<a id="FNanchor_1014_1014"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1014_1014">[1014]</a> for the purpose of regulating
the conflict of laws concerning marriage, divorce, and
guardianship. The signatory Powers are Germany,
Austria-Hungary, Belgium, Spain, France, Italy, Luxemburg,
Holland, Portugal, Roumania, Sweden, and
Switzerland.</p>

<p>(3) Again at the Hague, on July 17, 1905, were signed
two conventions for the purpose of regulating the conflict
of laws concerning the effect of marriage upon the
personal relations and the property of husband and wife,
and concerning the placing of adults under guardians
or curators. The signatory Powers are Germany, France,
Italy, Holland, Portugal, Roumania, and Sweden.<a id="FNanchor_1015_1015"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1015_1015">[1015]</a></p>

<p>(1) On October 30, 1886, Great Britain, Germany,
Argentina, Austria-Hungary, Belgium, Denmark, Spain,
the United States of America, France, Greece, Italy,
Japan, Mexico, Norway, Holland, Portugal, Roumania,
Russia, Sweden, and Switzerland signed a convention at
Berlin for the purpose of creating an International
Geodetic Association. Already in 1864 a number of
States had entered at Berlin into an Association concerning
geodetic work in Central Europe, and in 1867
the scope of the association was expanded to the whole
of Europe, but it was not until 1886 that the geodetic
work of the whole world was made the object of the
Geodetic Association. The convention of 1886, however,
was revised and a new convention was signed at
Berlin on October 11, 1895.<a id="FNanchor_1020_1020"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1020_1020">[1020]</a> The Association, which

<p>(2) On July 28, 1903, was signed at Strasburg a
convention for the purpose of creating an International
Seismologic Association. This convention was revised
on August 15, 1905, at Berlin.<a id="FNanchor_1021_1021"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1021_1021">[1021]</a> The following States

States of America, France, Greece, Italy, Japan, Mexico,
Norway, Holland, Portugal, Roumania, Russia, Servia,
and Switzerland. The Association, which arranges an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_626">[Pg 626]</a></span>

Christiania for the International Hydrographic and
Biologic Investigation of the North Sea.<a id="FNanchor_1022_1022"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1022_1022">[1022]</a> The parties

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

<div class="agate">PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK
</div><div>
To protect the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg”), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg™ License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™
electronic works
</div><div>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div><div>
1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div><div>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div><div>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div><div>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div><div>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div><blockquote><div>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div></blockquote><div>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div><div>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div><div>
1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.
</div><div>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.
</div><div>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div><div>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div><div>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:
</div><ul>
    <li>• You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    </li>
    <li>• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    </li>
    <li>• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </li>
    <li>• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    </li>
</ul><div>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div><div>
1.F.
</div><div>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div><div>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div><div>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
