Between the extremes of a simple\nand comparatively unimportant act of discourtesy\ncommitted by one State against another, on the one\nhand, and, on the other, so gross an insult as must\nnecessarily lead to war, there are many other grounds\nvarying in nature and importance. State differences\nare correctly divided into legal and political. Legal\ndifferences arise from acts for which States have to\nbear responsibility, be it acts of their own or of their\nParliaments, judicial and administrative officials, armed\nforces, or individuals living on their territory. [1] Political\ndifferences are the result of a conflict of political interests.\nBut although this distinction is certainly\ntheoretically correct and of practical importance, frequently\nin practice a sharp line cannot be drawn. For\nin many cases States either hide their political interests\nbehind a claim for an alleged injury, or make a positive, [Pg 4] but comparatively insignificant, injury a pretext for\nthe carrying out of political ends. Nations which\nhave been for years facing each other armed to the\nteeth, waiting for a convenient moment to engage in\nhostilities, are only too ready to obliterate the boundary\nline between legal and political differences. Between\nsuch nations a condition of continuous friction prevails\nwhich makes it difficult, if not impossible, in every\ncase which arises to distinguish the legal from the\npolitical character of the difference.",

It is often maintained that the Law of Nations\nis concerned with legal differences only, political\ndifferences being a matter not of law but of politics.\nNow it is certainly true that only legal differences can\nbe settled by a juristic decision of the underlying\njuristic question, whatever may be the way in which\nsuch decision is arrived at. But although political\ndifferences cannot be the objects of juristic decision,\nthey can be settled short of war by amicable or compulsive\nmeans. And legal differences, although within\nthe scope of juristic decision, can be of such kinds as\nto prevent the parties from submitting them to such\ndecision, without being of a nature that they cannot\nbe settled peaceably at all. Moreover, although the\ndistinction between legal and political differences is\ncertainly correct in theory and of importance in practice,\nnevertheless, in practice, a sharp line frequently cannot\nbe drawn, as has just been pointed out. Therefore the\nLaw of Nations is not exclusively concerned with legal\ndifferences, for in fact all amicable means of settling\nlegal differences are likewise means of settling political\ndifferences, and so are two of the compulsive means of\nsettling differences—namely, pacific blockade and intervention."

(articles 11-12). The parties may\nappoint Assessors, Agents, and Counsel (articles 10,\n13, 14).",

                                        "(3) The parties may agree upon the rules of procedure\nto be followed by the Commission, but if they do not\nprovide such rules themselves, the rules of procedure,\ncomprised in articles 19-32 are applicable (article 17),\nand, in any case, the Commission is to settle such\ndetails of the procedure as are either not covered by the\ntreaty of the parties or by articles 19-32, and is to\narrange all the formalities required for dealing with the\nevidence (article 18).",

The Report of the\nCommission is read in open Court, the Agents and Counsel\nof the parties being present or duly summoned to\nattend; a copy of the Report is furnished to each\nparty (article 34).

Great Britain demanded from Russia not only an apology and\nample damages, but also severe punishment of the officer responsible for\nthe outrage. As Russia maintained that the firing was caused by the\napproach of some Japanese torpedo-boats, and that she could therefore\nnot punish the officer in command, the parties agreed upon the\nestablishment of an International Commission of Inquiry, which, however,\nwas charged not only to ascertain the facts of the incident but also to\npronounce an opinion concerning the responsibility for the incident and\nthe degree of blame attaching to the responsible persons. The Commission\nconsisted of five naval officers of high rank—namely, one British, one\nRussian, one American, one French, and one Austrian, who sat at Paris in\nFebruary 1905. The report of the Commission states that no torpedo-boats\nhad been present, that the opening of fire on the part of the Baltic\nfleet was not justifiable, that Admiral Rojdestvensky, the commander of\nthe Baltic fleet, was responsible for the incident, but that these facts\nwere \"not of a nature to cast any discredit upon the military qualities\nor the humanity of Admiral Rojdestvensky or of the personnel of his\nsquadron.\" In consequence of the last part of this report Great Britain\ncould not insist upon any punishment to be meted out to the responsible\nRussian Admiral, but Russia paid a sum of £65,000 to indemnify the\nvictims of the incident and the families of the two dead fishermen.

But\nalthough good offices can easily develop into mediation,\nthey must not be confounded with it. The\ndifference between them is that, whereas good offices\nconsist in various kinds of action tending to call negotiations\nbetween the conflicting States into existence,\nmediation consists in a direct conduct of negotiations\nbetween the differing parties on the basis of proposals\nmade by the mediator. Good offices seek to induce\nthe conflicting parties, who are either not at all inclined\nto negotiate with each other or who have negotiated\nwithout effecting an understanding, to enter or to [Pg 12] re-enter into such negotiations. Good offices can also\nconsist in advice, in submitting a proposal of one of\nthe parties to the other, and the like, but they never\ntake part in the negotiations themselves. On the\nother hand, the mediator is the middleman who does\ntake part in the negotiations. He makes certain propositions\non the basis of which the States at variance\nmay come to an understanding. He even conducts\nthe negotiations himself, always anxious to reconcile\nthe opposing claims and to appease the feeling of resentment\nbetween the parties. All the efforts of the\nmediator may often, of course, be useless, the differing\nparties being unable or unwilling to consent to an\nagreement. But if an understanding is arrived at, the\nposition of the mediator as a party to the negotiation,\nalthough not a participator in the difference, frequently\nbecomes clearly apparent either by the drafting of a\nspecial act of mediation which is signed by the States\nat variance and the mediator, or by the fact that in\nthe convention between the conflicting States, which\nstipulates the terms of their understanding, the\nmediator is mentioned."

A real legal\nduty to offer good offices or mediation is not thereby\ncreated; only the expediency and desirability of such\noffer are recognised. In regard to the legal duty of conflicting\nStates to ask for good offices or mediation, it is\nobvious that, although literally such duty is agreed\nupon, the condition \"as far as circumstances allow\"\nmakes it more or less illusory, as it is in the discretion\nof the parties to judge for themselves whether or not\nthe circumstances of the special case allow their having\nrecourse to good offices and mediation.",

And, finally, in case of dispute\nbetween two Powers, one of them may always address\nto the International Bureau of the Permanent Court\nof Arbitration a note containing a declaration that it\nwould be ready to submit the dispute to arbitration,\nwhereupon the Bureau must at once inform the other\nPower of this declaration (article 48, paragraphs 3 and 4).

It is, therefore, necessary for such conflicting\nStates as intend to have the conflict determined\nby arbitration to conclude a treaty by which they\nagree to this course. Such treaty of arbitration involves\nthe obligation of both parties to submit in good\nfaith to the decision of the arbitrators. Frequently [Pg 17] a treaty of arbitration will be concluded after the outbreak\nof a difference, but it also frequently happens\nthat States concluding treaties stipulate therein by\nthe so-called Compromise Clause, [12] that any difference\narising between the parties respecting matters regulated\nby such treaty shall be determined by arbitration. Two\nor more States can also conclude a so-called general\ntreaty of arbitration, or treaty of permanent arbitration,\nstipulating that all or certain kinds of differences\nin future arising between them shall be settled by\nthis method. Thus article 7 of the Commercial Treaty\nbetween Holland and Portugal [13] of July 5, 1894,\ncontains such a general treaty of arbitration, as it\nstipulates arbitration not only for differences respecting\nmatters of commerce, but for all kinds of differences\narising in the future between the parties, provided\nthese differences do not concern their independence\nor autonomy.

Article 3 has,\nhowever, been struck out by the American Senate,\nwith the consequence that these treaties have lost\ntheir intrinsic value, even should they be ratified.",
                                        "It should be mentioned that, whereas most arbitration\ntreaties limit arbitration in one or more ways,\nexempting cases which concern the independence, the\nhonour, or the vital interests of the parties, Argentina [20] and Chili in 1902, Denmark and Holland in 1903,\nDenmark and Holland in 1905, Denmark and Portugal\nin 1907, Argentina and Italy in 1907, the Central\nAmerican Republics of Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, [Pg 22] Nicaragua, and San Salvador in 1907, Italy and\nHolland in 1907 entered into general arbitration treaties\naccording to which all differences without any exception\nshall be settled by arbitration.

There can be no doubt that arbitration is,\nand every day becomes more and more, of great importance.\nHistory proves that in antiquity and during\nthe Middle Ages arbitration was occasionally [22] made use\nof as a peaceable means of settling international differences.\nBut, although an International Law made its\nappearance in modern times, during the sixteenth,\nseventeenth, and eighteenth centuries very few cases\nof arbitration occurred. It was not until the end of\nthe eighteenth century that arbitration was frequently\nmade use of. There are 177 cases from 1794 to the\nend of 1900. [23] This number shows that the inclination\nof States to agree to arbitration has increased, and\nthere can be no doubt that arbitration has a great\nfuture. States and the public opinion of the whole\nworld become more and more convinced that there\nare a good many international differences which may\nwell be determined by arbitration without any danger\nwhatever to the national existence, independence,\ndignity, and prosperity of the States concerned. A\nnet of so-called Peace Societies has spread over the\nwhole world, and their members unceasingly work for\nthe promotion of arbitration. The Parliaments of\nseveral countries have repeatedly given their vote in\nfavour of arbitration; and the Hague Peace Conference\nof 1899 created a Permanent Court of Arbitration,\na step by which a new epoch of the development [Pg 23] of International Law was inaugurated. It is certain that\narbitration will gradually increase its range, although\nthe time is by no means in sight when all international\ndifferences will find their settlement by arbitration.",

Of the 97 articles of the Hague Convention\nfor the peaceful adjustment of international differences,\nno fewer than 44—namely, articles 37-90—deal with [Pg 24] arbitration in three chapters, headed \"On Arbitral\nJustice,\" \"On the Permanent Court of Arbitration,\"\nand \"On Arbitral Procedure.\" The first chapter,\narticles 37-40, contains rules on arbitral justice in\ngeneral, which, however, with one exception, are not\nof a legal but of a merely doctrinal character. Thus the\ndefinition in article 37, first paragraph, \"International\narbitration has for its object the determination of controversies\nbetween States by judges of their own choice\nand upon the basis of respect for law,\" is as doctrinal as\nthe assertion of article 38: \"In questions of a judicial\ncharacter, and especially in questions regarding the\ninterpretation or application of International Treaties\nor Conventions, arbitration is recognised by the contracting\nPowers as the most efficacious and at the same\ntime the most equitable method of deciding controversies\nwhich have not been settled by diplomatic\nmethods. Consequently it would be desirable that,\nin disputes regarding the above-mentioned questions,\nthe contracting Powers should, if the case arise, have\nrecourse to arbitration, in so far as circumstances\npermit.\" And the provision of article 39, that an\nagreement of arbitration may be made respecting\ndisputes already in existence or arising in the future\nand may relate to every kind of controversy or solely\nto controversies of a particular character, is as doctrinal\nas the reservation of article 40, which runs: \"Independently\nof existing general or special treaties imposing\nthe obligation to have recourse to arbitration on the\npart of any of the contracting Powers, these Powers\nreserve to themselves the right to conclude, either before\nthe ratification of the present Convention or afterwards,\nnew general or special agreements with a view to extending\nobligatory arbitration to all cases which they\nconsider possible to submit to it.\" The only rule of\nlegal character is that of article 37 (second paragraph), [Pg 25] enacting the already existing customary rule of International\nLaw, that \"the agreement of arbitration\nimplies the obligation to submit in good faith to the\narbitral sentence.\"",
                                        "On the signatory Powers no obligation whatever\nto submit any difference to arbitration is imposed.\nEven differences of a judicial character, and especially\nthose regarding the interpretation or application of\ntreaties, for the settlement of which the signatory\nPowers, in article 38, acknowledge arbitration as the\nmost efficacious and at the same time the most equitable\nmethod, need not necessarily be submitted to\narbitration.",

                                        "The principle found, firstly, indirect recognition by\nthe Convention respecting the Limitation of the Employment\nof Force for the Recovery of Contract Debts. [25] Since article I of this Convention stipulates that recourse\nto the employment of force for the recovery of\ncontract debts claimed from the Government of one\ncountry by the Government of another country as\nbeing due to its nationals is not allowed unless the\ndebtor State refuses arbitration, compulsory arbitration\nhas in this instance been victorious.",

Nevertheless, the characteristics of\ncompulsive means of settling international differences\nmake it a necessity to draw a sharp line between these [Pg 35] means and war. It is, firstly, characteristic of compulsive\nmeans that, although they frequently consist\nof harmful measures, they are neither by the conflicting\nnor by other States considered as acts of war,\nand consequently all relations of peace, such as diplomatic\nand commercial intercourse, the execution of\ntreaties, and the like, remain undisturbed. Compulsive\nmeans are in theory and practice considered\npeaceable, although not amicable, means of settling\ninternational differences. It is, further, characteristic\nof compulsive means that they are even at their worst\nconfined to the application of certain harmful measures\nonly, whereas belligerents in war may apply any amount\nand any kinds of force, with the exception only of those\nmethods forbidden by International Law.

Acts of reprisal may nowadays be performed\nonly by State organs such as armed forces, or men-of-war,\nor administrative officials, in compliance with a\nspecial order of their State. But in former times\nprivate individuals used to perform acts of reprisal.\nSuch private acts of reprisal seem to have been in\nvogue in antiquity, for there existed a law in Athens\naccording to which the relatives of an Athenian murdered\nabroad had, in case the foreign State refused\npunishment or extradition of the murderer, the right\nto seize and to bring before the Athenian Courts three\ncitizens of such foreign State (so-called ἀνδροληψία).\nDuring the Middle Ages, and even in modern times to [Pg 42] the end of the eighteenth century, States used to grant\nso-called \"Letters of Marque\" to such of their subjects\nas had been injured abroad either by a foreign State\nitself or its citizens without being able to get redress.\nThese Letters of Marque authorised the bearer to acts\nof self-help against the State concerned, its citizens\nand their property, for the purpose of obtaining satisfaction\nfor the wrong sustained. In later times,\nhowever, States themselves also performed acts of\nreprisal. Thereby acts of reprisal on the part of private\nindividuals fell more and more into disuse, and finally\ndisappeared totally with the end of the eighteenth\ncentury. The distinction between general and special\nreprisals, which used formerly to be drawn, is based\non the fact that in former times a State could either\nauthorise a single private individual to perform an act\nof reprisal ( special reprisals), or command its armed\nforces to perform all kinds of such acts ( general reprisals).\nThe term \"General Reprisals\" is by Great Britain\nnowadays used for the authorisation of the British\nfleet to seize in time of war all enemy ships and goods.\nPhillimore (III. § 10) cites the following Order in Council\nof March 27, 1854: \"Her Majesty having determined\nto afford active assistance to her ally, His Highness\nthe Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, for the protection\nof his dominions against the encroachments and unprovoked\naggression of His Imperial Majesty the Emperor\nof All the Russias, Her Majesty is therefore pleased, by\nand with the advice of Her Privy Council, to order,\nand it is hereby ordered, that general reprisals be granted\nagainst the ships, vessels, and goods of the Emperor of\nAll the Russias, and of his subjects, or others inhabiting\nwithin any of his countries, territories or dominions, so\nthat Her Majesty's fleets may lawfully seize all ships,\nvessels, and goods,\" &c."

It was not until the second quarter\nof the nineteenth century that the first case occurred\nof a so-called pacific blockade—that is, a blockade\nduring time of peace—as a compulsive means of settling\ninternational differences; and all such cases are\neither cases of intervention or of reprisals. [46] The\nfirst case, one of intervention, happened in 1827, when,\nduring the Greek insurrection, Great Britain, France,\nand Russia intervened in the interest of the independence\nof Greece and blockaded those parts of the\nGreek coast which were occupied by Turkish troops.\nAlthough this blockade led to the battle of Navarino,\nin which the Turkish fleet was destroyed, the Powers [Pg 49] maintained, nevertheless, that they were not at war\nwith Turkey. In 1831, France blockaded the Tagus\nas an act of reprisal for the purpose of exacting redress\nfrom Portugal for injuries sustained by French subjects.\nGreat Britain and France, exercising intervention\nfor the purpose of making Holland consent to\nthe independence of revolting Belgium, blockaded in\n1833 the coast of Holland. In 1838, France blockaded\nthe ports of Mexico as an act of reprisal, but Mexico\ndeclared war against France in answer to this pacific\nblockade. Likewise as an act of reprisal, and in the\nsame year, France blockaded the ports of Argentina;\nand in 1845, conjointly with Great Britain, France\nblockaded the ports of Argentina a second time. In\n1850, in the course of her differences with Greece on\naccount of the case of Don Pacifico, [47] Great Britain\nblockaded the Greek ports, but for Greek vessels only.\nAnother case of intervention was the pacific blockade\ninstituted in 1860 by Sardinia, in aid of an insurrection\nagainst the then Sicilian ports of Messina and Gaeta,\nbut the following year saw the conversion of the pacific\nblockade into a war blockade. In 1862 Great Britain\nby way of reprisal for the plundering of a wrecked\nBritish merchantman, blockaded the Brazilian port of\nRio de Janeiro. The blockade of the island of Formosa\nby France during her differences with China in 1884\nand that of the port of Menam by France during her\ndifferences with Siam in 1893 are likewise cases of\nreprisals. On the other hand, cases of intervention\nare the blockade of the Greek coast in 1886 by Great\nBritain, Austria-Hungary, Germany, Italy, and Russia,\nfor the purpose of preventing Greece from making war\nagainst Turkey; and further, the blockade of the\nisland of Crete in 1897 by the united Powers. The last\ncase occurred in 1902, when Great Britain, Germany, [Pg 50] and Italy blockaded, by way of reprisal, the coast of\nVenezuela. [48]",

But\nwhen States are driven into or deliberately wage war\nfor political reasons, no legally recognised act of self-help\nis in such case performed by the war. And the\nsame laws of war are valid, whether wars are waged on\naccount of legal or of political differences.",

The majority of the European\ncontinental writers for the last three generations have\npropagated the doctrine that no relation of enmity\nexists between belligerents and such private subjects,\nor between the private subjects of the respective belligerents.\nThis doctrine goes back to Rousseau, Contrat\nSocial , I. c. 4. In 1801, on the occasion of the opening [Pg 64] of the French Prize Court, the famous lawyer and\nstatesman Portalis adopted Rousseau's [63] doctrine by\ndeclaring that war is a relation between States and not\nbetween individuals, and that consequently the subjects\nof the belligerents are only enemies as soldiers,\nnot as citizens. And although this new doctrine did\nnot, as Hall (§ 18) shows, spread at once, it has since\nthe second half of the nineteenth century been proclaimed\non the European continent by the majority\nof writers.

[64] It is\nimpossible to sever the citizens from their State, and\nthe outbreak of war between two States cannot but\nmake their citizens enemies. But the point is unworthy\nof dispute, because it is only one of terms\nwithout any material consequences. [65] For, apart from\nthe terminology, the parties agree in substance upon\nthe rules of the Law of Nations regarding such private\nsubjects as do not directly or indirectly belong to the\narmed forces. [66] Nobody doubts that such private individuals\nare safe as regards their life and liberty, provided\nthey behave peacefully and loyally; and that,\nwith certain exceptions, their private property must\nnot be touched. On the other hand, nobody doubts\nthat, according to a generally recognised custom of\nmodern warfare, the belligerent who has occupied a [Pg 65] part or the whole of his opponent's territory, and who\ntreats such private individuals leniently according to\nthe rules of International Law, may punish them for any\nhostile act, since they do not enjoy the privileges of\nmembers of armed forces. Although, on the one hand,\nInternational Law by no means forbids, and, as a law\nbetween States, is not competent to forbid, private\nindividuals to take up arms against an enemy, it gives,\non the other hand, the right to the enemy to treat\nhostilities committed by private [67] individuals as acts\nof illegitimate warfare. A belligerent is under a duty\nto respect the life and liberty of private enemy individuals,\nbut he can carry out this duty under the\ncondition only that these private individuals abstain\nfrom hostilities against himself. Through military\noccupation in war such private individuals fall under\nthe authority [68] of the occupant, and he may therefore\ndemand that they comply with his orders regarding\nthe safety of his forces. The position of private enemy\nindividuals is made known to them through the proclamations\nwhich the commander-in-chief of an army\noccupying the territory usually publishes. Thus\nGeneral Sir Redvers Buller, when entering the territory\nof the South African Republic in 1900, published the\nfollowing proclamation:",

First,\nthere are no longer the forces of two States in the\nfield, because the defeated belligerent State has ceased\nto exist through the military occupation of its territory,\nthe downfall of its established Government, the capture\nof the main part and the routing of the remnant of its\nforces. And, secondly, there is no longer in progress\na contention between armed forces. For although the\nguerilla bands are still fighting when attacked, or when\nattacking small bodies of enemy soldiers, they try to\navoid a pitched battle, and content themselves with\nthe constant harassing of the victorious army, the destroying\nof bridges and railways, cutting off communications\nand supplies, attacking convoys, and the like,\nalways in the hope that some event or events may\noccur which will induce the victorious army to withdraw\nfrom the conquered territory.

It is, however, not advisable that\nthe victor should cease such treatment as long as those\nbands are under responsible commanders and observe [Pg 72] themselves the laws and usages of war. For I can see\nno advantage or reason why, although in strict law\nit could be done, those bands should be treated as\ncriminals. Such treatment would only call for acts\nof revenge on their part, without in the least accelerating\nthe pacification of the country. And it is, after all,\nto be taken into consideration that those bands act\nnot out of criminal but patriotic motives. With patience\nand firmness the victor will succeed in pacifying these\nbands without recourse to methods of harshness."

Ends of\nwar are those objects for the realisation of which a war\nis made.

The roots of the present\nLaws of War are to be traced back to practices of\nbelligerents which arose and grew gradually during\nthe latter part of the Middle Ages. The unsparing\ncruelty of the war practices during the greater part\nof the Middle Ages began gradually to be modified\nthrough the influence of Christianity and chivalry.\nAnd although these practices were cruel enough during\nthe fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth centuries,\nthey were mild compared with those of still earlier\ntimes. Decided progress was made during the eighteenth,\nand again during the nineteenth century, after\nthe close of the Napoleonic wars, especially in the years\nfrom 1850 to 1900. The laws of war evolved in this\nway: isolated milder practices became by-and-by\nusages, so-called usus in bello , manner of warfare, Kriegs-Manier , and these usages through custom and\ntreaties turned into legal rules. And this evolution\nis constantly going on, for, besides the recognised\nLaws of War, there are usages in existence which have\na tendency to become gradually legal rules of warfare.\nThe whole growth of the laws and usages of war is\ndetermined by three principles. There is, first, the\nprinciple that a belligerent should be justified in applying\nany amount and any kind of force which is necessary [Pg 79] for the realisation of the purpose of war—namely, the\noverpowering of the opponent. There is, secondly, the\nprinciple of humanity at work, which says that all such\nkinds and degrees of violence as are not necessary for\nthe overpowering of the opponent should not be permitted\nto a belligerent. And, thirdly and lastly, there\nis at work the principle of chivalry which arose in the\nMiddle Ages and introduced a certain amount of fairness\nin offence and defence, and a certain mutual respect.\nAnd, in contradistinction to the savage cruelty\nof former times, belligerents have in modern times\ncome to the conviction that the realisation of the\npurpose of war is in no way hampered by indulgence\nshown to the wounded, the prisoners, and the private\nindividuals who do not take part in the fighting. Thus\nthe influence of the principle of humanity has been\nand is still enormous upon the practice of warfare.\nAnd the methods of warfare, although by the nature\nof war to a certain degree cruel and unsparing, become\nless cruel and more humane every day. But it must\nbe emphasised that the whole evolution of the laws and\nusages of war could not have taken place but for the\ninstitution of standing armies, which dates from the\nfifteenth century. The humanising of the practices\nof war would have been impossible without the discipline\nof standing armies; and the important distinction\nbetween members of armed forces and private\nindividuals could not have arisen without the existence\nof standing armies."

A new Geneva Convention was signed on\nJuly 6, 1906, by thirty-five States, and several others\nhave already acceded. There is no doubt that the\nwhole civilised world will soon be a party to this new\nGeneva Convention.

These instructions, which were drafted by\nProfessor Francis Lieber, of the Columbia College of [Pg 81] New York, represent the first endeavour to codify the\nLaws of War, and they are even nowadays of great\nvalue and importance. In 1874 an International Conference,\ninvited by the Emperor Alexander II. of\nRussia, met at Brussels for the purpose of discussing\na draft code of the Laws of War on Land as prepared by\nRussia. The body of the articles agreed upon at this\nConference, and known as the \"Brussels Declarations,\"\nhave, however, never become law, as ratification was\nnever given by the Powers. But the Brussels Declarations\nwere made the basis of deliberations on the\npart of the Institute of International Law, which at\nits meeting at Oxford in 1880 adopted a Manual [81] of the\nLaws of War consisting of a body of 86 rules under the\ntitle Les Lois de la Guerre sur Terre , and a copy of\nthis draft code was sent to all the Governments of\nEurope and America. It was, however, not until the\nHague Peace Conference of 1899 that the Powers reassembled\nto discuss again the codification of the Laws\nof War. At this Conference the Brussels Declarations\nwere taken as the basis of the deliberations; but\nalthough the bulk of its articles was taken over, several\nimportant modifications were introduced in the Convention,\nwhich was finally agreed upon and ratified,\nonly a few Powers abstaining from ratification.",

It originated and found recognition in those\ntimes when warfare was not regulated by laws of war—that\nis universally binding customs and international\ntreaties, but only by usages ( Manier, i.e. Brauch ), and it\nsays that necessity in war overrules usages of warfare.\nIn our days, however, warfare is no longer regulated\nby usages only, but to a greater extent by laws, firm\nrules recognised either by international treaties or by\nuniversal custom. [88] These conventional and customary [Pg 85] rules cannot be overruled by necessity, unless they are\nframed in such a way as not to apply to a case of\nnecessity in self-preservation. Thus, for instance, the\nrules that poisoned arms and poison are forbidden, and\nthat it is not allowed treacherously to kill or wound\nindividuals belonging to the hostile army, do not lose\ntheir binding force even if escape from extreme danger\nor the realisation of the purpose of war would result\nfrom an act of this kind.

As the Law of Nations recognises the status\nof war and its effects as regards rights and duties\nbetween the two or more belligerents on the one hand,\nand, on the other, between the belligerents and neutral\nStates, the question arises what kind of States are [Pg 91] legally qualified to make war and to become thereby\nbelligerents. Publicists who discuss this question at\nall speak mostly of a right of States to make war, a jus belli . But if this so-called right is examined, it\nturns out to be no right at all, as there is no corresponding\nduty in those against whom the right is said\nto exist. [108] A State which makes war against another\nexercises one of its natural functions, and the only\nquestion is whether such State is or is not legally\nqualified to exercise such function. Now, according\nto the Law of Nations full-Sovereign States alone\npossess the legal qualification to become belligerents;\nhalf-and part-Sovereign States are not legally qualified\nto become belligerents. Since neutralised States,\nas Switzerland, Belgium, and Luxemburg, are full-Sovereign\nStates, they are legally qualified to become\nbelligerents, although their neutralisation binds them\nnot to make use of their qualification except for defence.\nIf they become belligerents because they are\nattacked, they do not lose their character as neutralised\nStates, but if they become belligerents for offensive\npurposes they ipso facto lose this character.",

As International Law grew up amongst the\nStates of Christendom, and as the circle of the members\nof the Family of Nations includes only civilised, although\nnot necessarily Christian, States, all writers on International\nLaw agree that in wars between themselves\nthe members of the Family of Nations should not make\nuse of barbarous forces—that is, troops consisting of [Pg 99] individuals belonging to savage tribes and barbarous\nraces.

There is no reason whatever why,\nfor instance, the members of a regiment eventually\nformed by the United States of America out of negroes\nbred and educated in America, or why members of\nIndian regiments under English commanders, if employed\nin wars between members of the Family of\nNations, should not enjoy the privileges due to the\nmembers of armed forces according to International Law.",

[126] From the fifteenth century, when privateering began to\ngrow up, down to the eighteenth century, belligerents\nused to grant such Letters of Marque to private ships\nowned by their subjects and by the subjects of neutral\nStates.

A case which happened in 1870, soon after\nthe outbreak of the Franco-German war, gave occasion\nfor the question whether converted merchantmen\ncould be considered a part of the armed naval forces\nof a belligerent. As the North-German Confederation\nowned only a few men-of-war, the creation of a volunteer\nfleet was intended. The King of Prussia, as President\nof the Confederation, invited the owners of private\nGerman vessels to make them a part of the German [Pg 101] navy under the following conditions: Every ship\nshould be assessed as to her value, and 10 per cent.\nof such value should at once be paid in cash to the\nowner as a price for the charter of the ship. The\nowner should engage the crew himself, but the latter\nshould become for the time of the war members of the\nGerman navy, wear the German naval uniform, and\nthe ship should sail under the German war flag and\nbe armed and adapted for her purpose by the German\nnaval authorities. Should the ship be captured or\ndestroyed by the enemy, the assessed value should be\npaid to her owners in full; but should it be restored\nafter the war undamaged, the owner should retain the\n10 per cent. received as charter price. All such vessels\nshould only try to capture or destroy French men-of-war,\nand if successful the owner should receive\na sum between £1500 and £7500 as premium. The\nFrench Government considered this scheme a disguised\nevasion of the Declaration of Paris which\nabolished privateering, and requested the intervention\nof Great Britain. The British Government brought\nthe case before the Law Officers of the Crown, who\ndeclared the German scheme to be substantially different\nfrom the revival of privateering, and consequently\nthe British Government refused to object to\nit. The scheme, however, was never put into practice. [129]",

France [131] has made arrangements with certain steamship companies\naccording to which their mail-boats have to be [Pg 102] constructed on plans approved by the Government,\nhave to be commanded by officers of the French navy,\nand have to be incorporated in the French navy at the\noutbreak of war.

Since the belligerents, for the realisation of\nthe purpose of war, are entitled to many kinds of\nmeasures against enemy persons and enemy property,\nthe question must be settled as to what persons and\nwhat property are vested with enemy character.\nNow it is, generally speaking, correct to say that,\nwhereas the subjects of the belligerents and the property\nof such subjects bear enemy character, the subjects of\nneutral States and the property of such subjects do [Pg 107] not bear enemy character. This rule has, however,\nimportant exceptions. For under certain circumstances\nand conditions enemy persons and property of\nenemy subjects may not bear, and, on the other hand,\nsubjects of neutral States and their property may\nbear, enemy character.

The Second Peace Conference of 1907\nproduced three articles on the matter—16, 17, and 18—in\nConvention V., accepted by all the signatory Powers,\nexcept Great Britain which, upon signing the Convention,\nentered a reservation against these three\narticles, and although these articles are only of minor\nimportance, they have to be taken into consideration.\nOn the other hand, the as yet unratified Declaration\nof London comprises a number of rules which, apart\nfrom two points, offer a common basis for the practice\nof all maritime States. At the first glance it would\nseem that only the four articles—57 to 60—of Chapter\nVI. headed \"Enemy Character,\" treat of the subject\nunder survey, but a closer examination shows that\narticle 46, dealing with a certain kind of unneutral\nservice, articles 55 and 56, dealing with transfer to\na neutral flag, and, lastly, article 63, dealing with\nforcible resistance to the right of visitation, are also\nconcerned with enemy character. In spite of these\nstipulations, which are accepted by all the Powers\nconcerned, there remain two important points unsettled, [Pg 108] since neither the Second Hague Peace Conference of\n1907 nor the Naval Conference of London of 1908-9\nsucceeded in agreeing upon a compromise concerning\nthe old controversy as to whether nationality exclusively,\nor domicile also, should determine the neutral\nor enemy character of individuals and their goods, and\nfurther, whether or not neutral vessels acquire enemy\ncharacter by embarking in time of war, with permission\nof the enemy, upon such trade with the latter as was\nclosed to them in time of peace (Rule of 1756). According\nto article 7 of Convention XII. of the Second Hague\nPeace Conference, concerning the establishment of an\nInternational Prize Court, likewise not yet ratified,\nthis Court would in time have to evolve a uniform\npractice of all the maritime States on these two points.",

Thus Grotius (III.\nc. 4, §§ 6 and 7) teaches that foreigners must share the\nfate of the population living on enemy territory, and\nBynkershoek [144] distinctly teaches that foreigners residing\nin enemy country bear enemy character. English [145] and American practice assert, therefore, that foreigners,\nwhether subjects of the belligerents or of neutral\nStates, acquire enemy character by being domiciled\n( i.e. resident) in enemy country, because they have\nthereby identified themselves with the enemy population\nand contribute, by paying taxes and the like,\nto the support of the enemy Government.

Not\neven France supported the German proposals, although\naccording to the French conception foreigners residing\nin enemy country do not acquire enemy character, and\ntherefore the German proposals were only a logical consequence\nof the French conception. This French conception\nof enemy character dates from the judgment of\nthe Conseil des Prises in the case of Le Hardy contre La\nVoltigeante [147] (1802), which laid down the rule that\nneutral subjects residing in enemy country do not lose\ntheir neutral character, and enemy subjects residing in\nneutral countries do not lose their enemy character.

The question of the transfer of enemy vessels\nto subjects of neutral States, either shortly before or\nduring the war, must be regarded as forming part of\nthe larger question of enemy character, for the point\nto be decided is whether such transfer [161] divests these\nvessels of their enemy character. It is obvious that,\nif this point is answered in the affirmative, the owners\nof enemy vessels can evade the danger of having their\nproperty seized and confiscated by selling their vessels\nto subjects of neutral States. Before the Declaration\nof London, which is, however, not yet ratified, the\nmaritime Powers had not agreed upon common rules [Pg 118] concerning this subject. According to French [162] practice no transfer of enemy vessels to neutrals could\nbe recognised, and a vessel thus transferred retained\nenemy character; but this concerned only transfer after\nthe outbreak of war, any legitimate transfer anterior\nto the outbreak of war did give neutral character to\na vessel. According to British and American practice,\non the other hand, neutral vessels could well be transferred\nto a neutral flag before or after the outbreak of\nwar and lose thereby their enemy character, provided\nthat the transfer took place bona fide , [163] was not effected\neither in a blockaded port [164] or while the vessel was in\ntransitu , [165] the vendor did not retain an interest in the\nvessel or did not stipulate a right to recover or repurchase\nthe vessel after the conclusion of the war, [166] and the transfer was not made in transitu in contemplation\nof war.

However, if the bill of sale is\nnot on board the transferred vessel, and if the transfer\nwas effected less than sixty days before the outbreak\nof hostilities, the transfer is presumed to be void, unless\nthe vessel can prove that such transfer was not effected [Pg 119] in order to avoid capture. To provide commerce with\na guarantee that a transfer should not easily be treated\nas void on the ground that it was effected for the purpose\nof evading capture, it is stipulated that, in case\nthe transfer was effected more than thirty days before\nthe outbreak of hostilities, there is an absolute presumption\nof its validity, provided the transfer was\nunconditional, complete, and in conformity with the\nlaws of the countries concerned, and further, provided\nthat neither the control of, nor the profits arising\nfrom, the employment of the vessels remain in the\nsame hands as before the transfer. But even in this\ncase a vessel is suspect if the transfer took place less\nthan sixty days before the outbreak of hostilities, and\nif her bill of sale is not on board. Hence she may be\nseized and brought into a port of a prize court for\ninvestigation, and she cannot claim damages for the\ncapture, even if the Court releases her.",

And such proof is excluded, and an\nabsolute presumption is established that the transfer\nis void, if the transfer has been made in a blockaded\nport or while the vessel was in transitu , further, if\na right to repurchase or recover the vessel is reserved\nto the vendor, and lastly, if the requirements of the\nMunicipal Law governing the right to fly the flag\nunder which the vessel is sailing have not been\nfulfilled.",

According to the former practice of the States\na condition of war could de facto arise either through\na declaration of war; or through a proclamation and\nmanifesto of a State that it considered itself at war\nwith another State; or through the committal by one\nState of certain hostile acts of force against another\nState. History presents many instances of wars commenced\nin one of these three ways. Although Grotius [Pg 122] (III. c. 3, § 5) laid down the rule that a declaration of\nwar is necessary for its commencement, the practice of\nthe States shows that this rule was not accepted, and\nmany wars have taken place between the time of\nGrotius and our own without a previous [172] declaration\nof war. Indeed many writers, [173] following the example\nof Grotius, have always asserted the existence of a\nrule that a declaration is necessary for the commencement\nof war, but it cannot be denied that until the\nSecond Peace Conference of 1907 such a rule was neither\nsanctioned by custom nor by a general treaty of the\nPowers. Moreover many writers [174] distinctly approved\nof the practice of the Powers. This does not mean\nthat in former times a State would have been justified\nin opening hostilities without any preceding conflict.\nThere was, and can be, no greater violation of the Law of\nNations than for a State to begin hostilities in time of\npeace without previous controversy and without having\nendeavoured to settle the conflict by negotiation. [175] But if negotiation had been tried without success, a\nState did not act treacherously in case it resorted to\nhostilities without a declaration of war, especially after\ndiplomatic intercourse had been broken off. The rule,\nadopted by the First Peace Conference of 1899—see\narticle 2 of the Conventions for the peaceful settlement\nof international differences of 1899 and 1907—which\nstipulates that, as far as circumstances allow , before the\nappeal to arms recourse must be had to the good offices\nor mediation of friendly Powers, did not essentially\nalter matters, for the formula as far as circumstances [Pg 123] allow leaves practically everything to the discretion of\nthe Power bent on making war.",

The Institute of International Law, at its\nmeeting at Ghent in 1906, adopted three principles [176] according to which war should not be commenced\nwithout either a declaration of war or an ultimatum,\nand in either case a certain delay sufficient to ensure\nagainst treacherous surprise must be allowed before the\nbelligerent can have recourse to actual hostilities. The\nSecond Peace Conference at the Hague in 1907 took\nthe matter up and produced the Convention (III.)\nrelative to the commencement of hostilities which\ncomprises four articles and has been signed by all the\nPowers represented at the Conference, except China\nand Nicaragua, both of which, however, acceded later.",

Thus a State [Pg 127] might deliberately order hostilities to be commenced\nwithout a previous declaration of war or qualified\nultimatum. Further, the armed forces of two States\nhaving a grievance against one another might engage\nin hostilities without having been authorised thereto\nand without the respective Governments ordering them\nto desist from further hostilities.

In former times they could\nat once be detained as prisoners of war, and many\nStates, therefore, concluded in time of peace special\ntreaties for the time of war expressly stipulating a\nspecified period during which their subjects should be\nallowed to leave each other's territory unmolested. [187] Through the influence of such treaties, which became\npretty general during the eighteenth century, it\nbecame an international practice that, as a rule,\nenemy subjects must be allowed to withdraw within\na reasonable period, and no instance of the former\nrule has occurred during the nineteenth [188] century.\nAlthough some [189] writers even nowadays maintain that\naccording to strict law the old rule is still in force, it\nmay safely [190] be maintained that there is now a customary\nrule of International Law, according to which\nall such subjects of the enemy as have not according to\nthe Municipal Law of their country to join the armed\nforces of the enemy must be allowed a reasonable\nperiod for withdrawal. On the other hand, such enemy\nsubjects as are active or reserve officers, or reservists,\nand the like, may be prevented from leaving the [Pg 132] country and detained as prisoners of war, for the\nprinciple of self-preservation must justify belligerents\nin refusing to furnish each other with resources which\nincrease their means of offence and defence. [191] However\nthat may be, a belligerent need not allow [192] enemy subjects\nto remain on his territory, although this is frequently\ndone. Thus, during the Crimean War Russian\nsubjects in Great Britain and France were allowed to\nremain there, as were likewise Russians in Japan and\nJapanese in Russia during the Russo-Japanese War,\nand Turks in Italy during the Turco-Italian War.\nOn the other hand, France expelled all Germans during\nthe Franco-German war in 1870; the former South\nAfrican Republics expelled most British subjects when\nwar broke out in 1899; Russia, although during the\nRusso-Japanese War she allowed Japanese subjects\nto remain in other parts of her territory, expelled\nthem from her provinces in the Far East; and in\nMay 1912, eight months after the outbreak of the\nTurko-Italian War, Turkey decreed the expulsion of\nall Italians, certain classes excepted. In case a belligerent\nallows the residence of enemy subjects on his\nterritory, he can, of course, give the permission\nunder certain conditions only, such as an oath to\nabstain from all hostile acts or a promise not to leave a\ncertain region, and the like. And it must be especially\nobserved that an enemy subject who is allowed to stay\nin the country after the outbreak of war must not, in\ncase the forces of his home State militarily occupy the\npart of the country inhabited by him, join these forces\nor assist them in any way. If, nevertheless, he does\nso, he is liable to be punished for treason [193] by the local\nSovereign after the withdrawal of the enemy forces.",

In former times International Law empowered\nStates at the outbreak of war to lay an embargo\nupon all enemy merchantmen in their harbours in order\nto confiscate them. And enemy merchantmen on the\nsea could at the outbreak of war be captured and confiscated\nalthough they did not even know of the outbreak\nof war. As regards enemy merchantmen in\nthe harbours of the belligerents, it became, from the\noutbreak of the Crimean War in 1854, a usage, if not a\ncustom, that no embargo [227] could be laid on them for\nthe purpose of confiscating them, and that a reasonable\ntime must be granted them to depart unmolested; but\nno rule was in existence until the Second Peace Conference\nof 1907 which prescribed immunity from confiscation\nfor such enemy merchantmen at sea as did not\nknow of the outbreak of war. This Conference took\nthe matter into consideration, and produced a Convention\n(VI.) relative to the status of enemy merchantmen\nat the outbreak of hostilities [228] which is signed by\nall the Powers represented at the Conference, except [Pg 141] the United States of America, [229] China, and Nicaragua;\nbut Nicaragua acceded later. In coming to an agreement\non the subject, two facts had to be taken into\nconsideration. There is, firstly, the fact that in all\nmaritime countries numerous merchantmen are now\nbuilt from special designs in order that they may\nquickly, at the outbreak of or during war, be converted\ninto cruisers; it would therefore be folly on the part\nof a belligerent to grant any lenient treatment to such\nvessels. There is, secondly, the fact, that a belligerent\nfleet cannot nowadays remain effective for long without\nbeing accompanied by a train of colliers, transport\nvessels, and repairing vessels; it is, therefore, of the\ngreatest importance for a belligerent to have as many\nmerchantmen as possible at his disposal for the purpose\nof making use of them for such assistance to the fleet.\nFor this reason, Convention VI. represents a compromise,\nand it distinguishes between vessels in the harbours\nof the belligerents and vessels on the sea. Its\nprovisions are the following:—",
                                        "[Footnote 227: See\n above, § 40 .]",
                                        "[Footnote 228: See Lémonon, pp. 647-661; Higgins, pp. 300-307; Nippold,\nII. pp. 146-153; Scott, Conferences , pp. 556-568; Dupuis, Guerre ,\nNos. 74-81; Scott in A.J. II. (1908), pp. 260-269.]",
                                        "[Footnote 229: The United States of America refused to sign the Convention\nbecause she considers its stipulations retrogressive as they are less\nliberal than the practice which has prevailed since 1854. But\ncircumstances have changed since that time, and the two facts explained\nin the text would seem to have compelled the maritime Powers to adopt\nrules somewhat less liberal. This was the more necessary since no\nagreement could be arrived at concerning the question of the locality in\nwhich belligerents should be allowed to convert merchantmen into\ncruisers.]",
                                        "(1) Article 1 of the Convention enacts that, in case\nan enemy merchantman is at the beginning of the war\nin the port of a belligerent, it is desirable that she should\nbe allowed freely to depart, either immediately or after\na sufficient term of grace, and, after being furnished\nwith a passport, to proceed either direct to her port of\ndestination or to such other port as may be determined.\nIt is obvious that, since only the desirability of free\ndeparture of such vessels is stipulated, a belligerent is\nnot compelled to grant free departure; nevertheless\nthere must be grave reasons for not acting in accordance [Pg 142] with what is considered desirable by article 1. And\nit must be specially observed that a belligerent may\nmake a distinction in the treatment of several enemy\nvessels in his harbours, and may grant free departure to\none or more of them, and refuse it to others, according\nto his discretion.",
                                        "(2) The former usage that enemy merchantmen in\nthe harbours of the belligerents at the outbreak of war\nmay not be confiscated, has been made a binding rule by article 2 which enacts that such vessels as were not\nallowed to leave, or were by force majeure prevented\nfrom leaving during the term of grace, may not be confiscated,\nbut may only be detained under the obligation\nthat they shall be restored, without indemnity, after the\nconclusion of peace, or they may be requisitioned on\ncondition of indemnities to be paid to the owners.",
                                        "(3) Enemy merchantmen which have left their last\nport of departure before the outbreak of war and which,\nwhile ignorant of the outbreak of war, are met at sea by\ncruisers of the belligerents, may, according to article 3,\nbe captured, but they may not be confiscated, for they\nmust be restored after the war is ended, although no\nindemnities need be paid. Indemnities are only to\nbe paid in case the vessels have been requisitioned or\ndestroyed, for a belligerent is empowered to requisition\nor destroy such vessels provided he takes care to preserve\nthe ship papers and makes arrangements for the\nsafety of the persons on board.",
                                        "It is obvious that, in case such vessels are not\nignorant of the outbreak of war—having, for instance,\nreceived the news by wireless telegraphy—they may not\nany longer claim the privileges stipulated by article 3.\nAnd this article stipulates expressly that after having\ntouched a port of their own or of a neutral country,\nsuch vessels are no longer privileged.",
                                        "(4) Enemy goods on board such enemy merchantmen [Pg 143] as are in the harbour of a belligerent at the outbreak\nof war or at sea and are in ignorance of the outbreak\nof war are, according to article 4, privileged to\nthe same extent as the vessels concerned.",
                                        "(5) Enemy merchantmen whose construction indicates\nthat they are intended to be converted into\ncruisers may be seized and confiscated in the harbours\nof the belligerents, as well as at sea, although ignorant\nof the outbreak of war, for article 5 stipulates expressly\nthat Convention VI. does not affect such vessels.",

Although [246] since the seventeenth century\nseveral hundreds of special treaties have been concluded\nbetween different States regarding the tending\nof each other's wounded and the exemption of army\nsurgeons from captivity, no general rule of the Law\nof Nations on these points was in existence until the\nsecond half of the nineteenth century other than one\nprohibiting the killing, mutilation, or ill-treatment of [Pg 155] the wounded. A change for the better was initiated\nby Jean Henry Dunant, a Swiss citizen from Geneva,\nwho was an eye-witness of the battle of Solferino in\n1859, where many thousands of wounded died who\ncould, under more favourable circumstances, have been\nsaved. When he published, in 1861 and 1863, his\npamphlet, Un Souvenir de Solférino , the Geneva Société\nd'utilité publique , under the presidency of Gustave\nMoynier, created an agitation in favour of better\narrangements for the tending of the wounded on the\nbattlefield, and convoked an international congress at\nGeneva in 1863, where thirty-six representatives of\nnearly all the European States met and discussed the\nmatter. In 1864 the Bundesrath, the Government\nof the Federal State of Switzerland, took the matter\nin hand officially, and invited all European and several\nAmerican States to send official representatives to a\nCongress at Geneva for the purpose of discussing and\nconcluding an international treaty regarding the\nwounded. This Congress met in 1864, and sixteen\nStates were represented. Its result was the international\n\"Convention [247] for the Amelioration of the\nCondition of Soldiers wounded in Armies in the Field,\"\ncommonly called \"Geneva Convention,\" signed on\nAugust 22, 1864. By-and-by States other than the\noriginal signatories joined the Convention, and finally\nthe whole body of the civilised States of the world,\nwith the exception of Costa Rica, Monaco, and Lichtenstein,\nbecame parties. That the rules of the Convention\nwere in no wise perfect, and needed to be supplemented\nregarding many points, soon became apparent. A\nsecond International Congress met at the invitation\nof Switzerland in 1868 at Geneva, where additional\narticles [248] to the original Convention were discussed and [Pg 156] signed. These additional articles have, however, never\nbeen ratified. The First Hague Peace Conference in\n1899 unanimously formulated the wish that Switzerland\nshould shortly take steps for the assemblage of another\ninternational congress in order to revise the Geneva\nConvention.

If they\nwere spared, they were as a rule made slaves and only\nexceptionally liberated. But belligerents also exchanged\ntheir prisoners or liberated them for ransom.\nDuring the first part of the Middle Ages prisoners of [Pg 166] war could likewise be killed or made slaves. Under\nthe influence of Christianity, however, their fate in time\nbecame mitigated. Although they were often most\ncruelly treated during the second part of the Middle\nAges, they were not as a rule killed and, with the disappearance\nof slavery in Europe, they were no longer\nenslaved. By the time modern International Law\ngradually came into existence, killing and enslaving\nprisoners of war had disappeared, but they were still\noften treated as criminals and as objects of personal revenge.\nThey were not considered in the power of the\nState by whose forces they were captured, but in the\npower of those very forces or of the individual soldiers\nthat had made the capture. And it was considered\nlawful on the part of captors to make as much profit\nas possible out of their prisoners by way of ransom,\nprovided no exchange of prisoners took place. So\ngeneral was this practice that a more or less definite\nscale of ransom became usual. Thus, Grotius (III.\nc. 14, § 9) mentions that in his time the ransom of a\nprivate was the amount of his one month's pay. And\nsince the pecuniary value of a prisoner as regards\nransom rose in proportion with his fortune and his\nposition in life and in the enemy army, it became usual\nfor prisoners of rank and note not to belong to the\ncapturing forces but to the Sovereign, who had, however,\nto recompense the captors. During the seventeenth\ncentury, the custom that prisoners were considered\nin the power of their captors died away. They were\nnow considered to be in the power of the Sovereign\nby whose forces they were captured. But rules of\nthe Law of Nations regarding their proper treatment\nwere hardly in existence. The practice of liberating\nprisoners in exchange, or for ransom only, continued.\nSpecial cartels were often concluded at the outbreak\nof or during a war for the purpose of stipulating a scale [Pg 167] of ransom according to which either belligerent could\nredeem his soldiers and officers from captivity. The\nlast [256] instance of such cartels is that between England\nand France in 1780, stipulating the ransom for members\nof the naval and military forces of both belligerents.",

The\nconviction in time became general that captivity\nshould only be the means of preventing prisoners from\nreturning to their corps and taking up arms again,\nand should, as a matter of principle, be distinguished\nfrom imprisonment as a punishment for crimes. The\nTreaty of Friendship [257] concluded in 1785 between\nPrussia and the United States of America was probably\nthe first to stipulate (article 24) the proper treatment\nof prisoners of war, prohibiting confinement in convict\nprisons and the use of irons, and insisting upon their\nconfinement in a healthy place, where they may have\nexercise, and where they may be kept and fed as troops.\nDuring the nineteenth century the principle that\nprisoners of war should be treated by their captor in\na manner analogous to that meted out to his own\ntroops became generally recognised, and the Hague\nRegulations have now, by articles 4 to 20, enacted\nexhaustive rules regarding captivity.",

They may only be imprisoned as an unavoidable\nmatter of safety, and only while the circumstances\nwhich necessitate the measure continue to exist.\nThey may, therefore, be detained in a town, fortress,\ncamp, or any other locality, and they may be bound\nnot to go beyond a certain fixed boundary. But they\nmay not be kept in convict prisons. Except in the case\nof officers, their labour may be utilised by the Government\naccording to their rank and aptitude, but their\ntasks must not be excessive and must have nothing to\ndo with military operations. Work done by them for\nthe State must be paid for in accordance with tariffs\nin force for soldiers of the national army employed on\nsimilar tasks, or, in case there are no such tariffs in\nforce, at rates proportional to the work executed. But\nprisoners of war may also be authorised to work for\nother branches of the public service or for private\npersons under conditions of employment to be settled\nby the military authorities, and they may likewise\nbe authorised to work on their own account. All\nwages they receive go towards improving their position,\nand a balance must be paid to them at the time of\ntheir release, after deducting the cost of their maintenance.\nBut whether they earn wages or not, the\nGovernment is bound under all circumstances to\nmaintain them, and provide quarters, food, and clothing\nfor them on the same footing as for its own troops.\nOfficer prisoners must receive the same pay as officers\nof corresponding rank in the country where they are\ndetained, the amount to be repaid by their Government\nafter the conclusion of peace. All prisoners of war\nmust enjoy every latitude in the exercise of their\nreligion, including attendance at their own church\nservice, provided only they comply with the regulations [Pg 169] for order issued by the military authorities. If a\nprisoner wants to make a will, it must be received by\nthe authorities or drawn up on the same conditions as\nfor soldiers of the national army. And the same rules\nare valid regarding death certificates and the burial of\nprisoners of war, and due regard must be paid to their\ngrade and rank. Letters, money orders, valuables, and\npostal parcels destined for or despatched by prisoners\nof war must enjoy free postage, and gifts and relief in\nkind for prisoners of war must be admitted free from\nall custom and other duties as well as payments for\ncarriage by Government railways (article 16).",

According to a former rule of the Law\nof Nations all enemy property, public or private,\nwhich a belligerent could get hold of on the battlefield\nwas booty and could be appropriated. Although\nsome modern publicists [272] who wrote before the Hague\nPeace Conference of 1899 teach the validity of this rule,\nit is obvious from articles 4 and 14 of the Hague Regulations\nthat it is now obsolete as regards private [273] enemy property except military papers, arms, horses,\nand the like.

Thus weapons,\nmunition, and valuable pieces of equipment which are\nfound upon the dead, the wounded, and the prisoners,\nwhether they are public or private property, may be\nseized, as may also the war-chest and State papers in\npossession of a captured commander, enemy horses,\nbatteries, carts, and everything else that is of value.\nTo whom the booty ultimately belongs is not for\nInternational but for Municipal Law [274] to determine,\nsince International Law simply states that public\nenemy property on the battlefield can be appropriated\nby belligerents.

[286] This means that every belligerent may\nmake his enemy pay as far as possible for the continuation\nof the war. But this principle, though it is as old\nas war and will only die with war itself, has not the\nsame effect in modern times on the actions of belligerents\nas it formerly had. For thousands of years\nbelligerents used to appropriate all private and public\nenemy property they could obtain, and, when modern\nInternational Law grew up, this practice found legal\nsanction. But after the end of the seventeenth century\nthis practice grew milder under the influence of the\nexperience that the provisioning of armies in enemy\nterritory became more or less impossible when the\ninhabitants were treated according to the old principle.\nAlthough belligerents retained in strict law the right to\nappropriate all private besides all public property, it\nbecame usual to abstain from enforcing such right, [Pg 184] and in lieu thereof to impose contributions of cash\nand requisitions in kind upon the inhabitants of the\ninvaded country. [287] And when this usage developed,\nno belligerent ever thought of paying in cash for requisitions,\nor giving a receipt for them. But in the\nnineteenth century another practice became usual.\nCommanders then often gave a receipt for contributions\nand requisitions, in order to avoid abuse and to\nprevent further demands for fresh contributions and\nrequisitions by succeeding commanders without knowledge\nof the former impositions. And there are instances\nof cases during the nineteenth century on\nrecord in which belligerents actually paid in cash for\nall requisitions they made. The usual practice at the\nend of the nineteenth century was that commanders\nalways gave a receipt for contributions, and that they\neither paid in cash for requisitions or acknowledged\nthem by receipt, so that the respective inhabitants\ncould be indemnified by their own Government after\nconclusion of peace. However, no restriction whatever\nwas imposed upon commanders with regard to the\namount of contributions and requisitions, and with\nregard to the proportion between the resources of a\ncountry and the burden imposed. The Hague Regulations\nhave now settled the matter of contributions\nand requisitions in a progressive way by enacting\nrules which put the whole matter on a new basis.\nThat war must support war remains a principle under\nthese regulations also. But they are widely influenced\nby the demand that the enemy State as such, and not\nthe private enemy individuals, should be made to support\nthe war, and that only so far as the necessities of\nwar demand it should contributions and requisitions be\nimposed. Although certain public moveable property [Pg 185] and the produce of public immoveables may be appropriated\nas heretofore, requisitions must be paid for in\ncash or, if this is impossible, acknowledged by receipt.",

They may not be made by individual soldiers\nor officers, but only by the commander in the locality.\nAll requisitions must be paid for in cash, and if this\nis impossible, they must be acknowledged by receipt,\nand the payment of the amount must be made as soon\nas possible. The principle that requisitions must be\npaid for by the enemy is thereby absolutely recognised,\nbut, of course, commanders-in-chief may levy contributions—see\nbelow, § 148 —in case they do not possess cash\nfor the payment of requisitions.

[Pg 186] Although the Hague Regulations do not specially\nmention quartering, article 52 is nevertheless to be\napplied to it, since quartering is nothing else than a\nspecial kind of requisition.

Likewise, soldiers or civilians charged\nwith the delivery of despatches for their own army or\nfor that of the enemy and carrying out their mission\nopenly are not spies. And it matters not whether\ndespatch-bearers make use of balloons or of other\nmeans of communication. Thus, a soldier or civilian\ntrying to carry despatches from a force besieged in a\nfortress to other forces of the same belligerent, whether\nmaking use of a balloon or riding or walking at night,\nmay not be treated as a spy. On the other hand,\nspying can well be carried out by despatch-bearers or\nby persons in a balloon, whether they make use of the\nballoon of a despatch-bearer or rise in a balloon for\nthe special purpose of spying. [309] The mere fact that a [Pg 198] balloon is visible does not protect the persons using it\nfrom being treated as spies; since spying can be\ncarried out under false pretences quite as well as\nclandestinely.

As he was not seeking\ninformation, [311] and therefore was not a spy according to\narticle 29 of the Hague Regulations, a conviction for\nespionage would not, if such a case occurred to-day, be\njustified.

He can\nnow not only make use of the resources of the enemy\ncountry for military purposes, but can also keep it for\nthe time being as a pledge of his military success, and\nthereby impress upon the enemy the necessity of submitting\nto terms of peace. And in regard to occupation,\nInternational Law respecting warfare has progressed\nmore than in any other department. In former times\nenemy territory that was occupied by a belligerent\nwas in every point considered his State property, with\nwhich and with the inhabitants therein he could do\nwhat he liked. He could devastate the country with fire\nand sword, appropriate all public and private property [Pg 205] therein, kill the inhabitants, or take them away into\ncaptivity, or make them take an oath of allegiance.\nHe could, even before the war was decided and his\noccupation was definitive, dispose of the territory by\nceding it to a third State, and an instance of this\nhappened during the Northern War (1700-1718), when\nin 1715 Denmark sold the occupied Swedish territories\nof Bremen and Verden to Hanover. That an occupant\ncould force the inhabitants of the occupied territory\nto serve in his own army and to fight against their\nlegitimate sovereign, was indubitable. Thus, during\nthe Seven Years' War, Frederick II. of Prussia repeatedly\nmade forcible levies of thousands of recruits\nin Saxony, which he had occupied. But during the\nsecond half of the eighteenth century things gradually\nbegan to undergo a change. That the distinction between\nmere temporary military occupation of territory,\non the one hand, and, on the other, real acquisition of\nterritory through conquest and subjugation, became\nmore and more apparent, is shown by the fact that\nVattel (III. § 197) drew attention to it. However, it was\nnot till long after the Napoleonic wars in the nineteenth\ncentury that the consequences of this distinction were\ncarried to their full extent by the theory and practice\nof International Law. So late as 1808, after the\nRussian troops had militarily occupied Finland, which\nwas at that time a part of Sweden, Alexander I. of\nRussia made the inhabitants take an oath of allegiance, [324] although it was only by article 4 of the Peace Treaty of\nFrederikshamm [325] of September 17, 1809, that Sweden\nceded Finland to Russia. The first writer who drew\nall the consequences of the distinction between mere\nmilitary occupation and real acquisition of territory was\nHeffter in his treatise Das Europaeische Völkerrecht der\nGegenwart (§ 131), which made its appearance in 1844. [Pg 206] And it is certain that it took the whole of the nineteenth\ncentury to develop such rules regarding occupation as\nare now universally recognised and in many respects\nenacted by articles 42-56 of the Hague Regulations.",

What concerns us here are\nthe rights and duties of the occupying belligerent in\nrelation to his political administration of the territory\nand to his political authority over its inhabitants. [326] The principle underlying these modern rules is that,\nalthough the occupant does in no wise acquire sovereignty\nover such territory through the mere fact\nof having occupied it, he actually exercises for the\ntime being a military authority over it. As he thereby\nprevents the legitimate Sovereign from exercising his\nauthority and claims obedience for himself from the\ninhabitants, he has to administer the country not only\nin the interest of his own military advantage, but also,\nso far as possible at any rate, for the public benefit of\nthe inhabitants.

[Pg 207] Invasion is the marching or riding of troops—or\nthe flying of a military air vessel—into enemy country.\nOccupation is invasion plus taking possession of enemy\ncountry for the purpose of holding it, at any rate temporarily.\nThe difference between mere invasion and\noccupation becomes apparent by the fact that an\noccupant sets up some kind of administration, whereas\nthe mere invader does not. A small belligerent force\ncan raid enemy territory without establishing any\nadministration, but quickly rush on to some place in\nthe interior for the purpose of reconnoitring, of destroying\na bridge or depôt of munitions and provisions, and\nthe like, and quickly withdraw after having realised its\npurpose. [327] Although it may correctly be asserted that,\nso long and in so far as such raiding force is in possession\nof a locality and sets up a temporary administration\ntherein, it occupies this locality, yet it certainly does\nnot occupy the whole territory, and even the occupation\nof such locality ceases the moment the force\nwithdraws.",

                                        "However this may be, as a rule occupation will be\ncoincident with invasion. The troops march into a\ndistrict, and the moment they get into a village or\ntown—unless they are actually fighting their way—they\ntake possession of the Municipal Offices, the\nPost Office, the Police Stations, and the like, and\nassert their authority there. From the military point\nof view such villages and towns are now \"occupied.\"\nArticle 42 of the Hague Regulations enacts that\nterritory is considered occupied when it is actually\nplaced under the authority of the hostile army, and\nthat such occupation applies only to the territory where\nthat authority is established and in a position to assert\nitself. This definition of occupation is not at all precise,\nbut it is as precise as a legal definition of such kind of [Pg 208] fact as occupation can be. If, as some publicists [328] maintain, only such territory were actually occupied,\nin which every part is held by a sufficient number of\nsoldiers to enforce immediately and on the very spot\nthe authority of an occupant, an effective occupation\nof a large territory would be impossible, since then not\nonly in every town, village, and railway station, but\nalso in every isolated habitation and hut the presence\nof a sufficient number of soldiers would be necessary.\nReasonably no other conditions ought to be laid down\nas necessary to constitute effective occupation in war\nthan those under which in time of peace a Sovereign\nis able to assert his authority over a territory. What\nthese conditions are is a question of fact which is to be\nanswered according to the merits of the special case.\nWhen the legitimate Sovereign is prevented from\nexercising his powers and the occupant, being able to\nassert his authority, actually establishes an administration\nover a territory, it matters not with what\nmeans and in what ways his authority is exercised.\nFor instance, when in the centre of a territory a large\nforce is established from which flying columns are\nconstantly sent round the territory, such territory is\nindeed effectively occupied, provided there are no\nenemy forces present, and, further, provided these\ncolumns can really keep the territory concerned under\ncontrol. [329] Again, when an army is marching on through\nenemy territory, taking possession of the lines of communication\nand the open towns, surrounding the\nfortresses with besieging forces, and disarming the [Pg 209] inhabitants in open places of habitation, the whole\nterritory left behind the army is effectively occupied,\nprovided some kind of administration is established,\nand further provided that, as soon as it becomes\nnecessary to assert the authority of the occupant, a\nsufficient force can within reasonable time be sent to\nthe locality affected. The conditions vary with those\nof the country concerned. When a vast country is\nthinly populated, a smaller force is necessary to occupy\nit, and a smaller number of centres need be garrisoned\nthan in the case of a thickly populated country. Thus,\nthe occupation of the former Orange Free State and\nthe former South African Republic became effective\nin 1901 some time after their annexation by Great\nBritain and the degeneration of ordinary war into\nguerilla war, although only about 250,000 British\nsoldiers had to keep up the occupation of a territory of\nabout 500,000 square miles. The fact that all the\ntowns and all the lines of communication were in the\nhands and under the administration of the British\narmy, that the inhabitants of smaller places were taken\naway into concentration camps, that the enemy forces\nwere either in captivity or dispersed into comparatively\nsmall guerilla bands, and finally, that wherever such\nbands tried to make an attack, a sufficient British\nforce could within reasonable time make its appearance,\nwas quite sufficient to assert British authority [330] over [Pg 210] that vast territory, although it was more than a year\nbefore peace was finally established.",

It is evident that in times when a belligerent\ncould destroy all public and private enemy property he\nwas able to seize, no special rule existed regarding\nprivate enemy ships and private enemy property\ncarried by them on the sea. But the practice of sea\nwarfare frequently went beyond the limits of even so\nwide a right, treating neutral goods on enemy ships as\nenemy goods, and treating neutral ships carrying enemy\ngoods as enemy ships. It was not until the time of the Consolato del Mare in the fourteenth century that a\nset of clear and definite rules with regard to private\nenemy vessels and private enemy property on sea in\ncontradistinction to neutral ships and neutral goods\nwas adopted. According to this famous collection of\nmaritime usages observed by the communities of the\nMediterranean, there is no doubt that a belligerent\nmay seize and appropriate all private enemy ships and\ngoods. But a distinction is made in case of either ship\nor goods being neutral. Although an enemy ship may\nalways be appropriated, neutral goods thereon have to\nbe restored to the neutral owners. On the other hand,\nenemy goods on neutral ships may be appropriated, but [Pg 219] the neutral ships carrying such goods must be restored\nto their owners. However, these rules of the Consolato\ndel Mare were not at all generally recognised, although\nthey were adopted by several treaties between single\nStates during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.\nNeither the communities belonging to the Hanseatic\nLeague, nor the Netherlands and Spain during the War\nof Independence, nor England and Spain during their\nwars in the sixteenth century, adopted these rules.\nAnd France expressly enacted by Ordinances of 1543\n(article 42) and 1583 (article 69) that neutral goods on\nenemy ships as well as neutral ships carrying enemy\ngoods should be appropriated. [344] Although France\nadopted in 1650 the rules of the Consolato del Mare ,\nLouis XIV. dropped them again by the Ordinance of\n1681 and re-enacted that neutral goods on enemy ships\nand neutral ships carrying enemy goods should be\nappropriated. Spain enacted the same rules in 1718.\nThe Netherlands, in contradistinction to the Consolato\ndel Mare , endeavoured by a number of treaties to foster\nthe principle that the flag covers the goods, so that\nenemy goods on neutral vessels were exempt from,\nwhereas neutral goods on enemy vessels were subject\nto, appropriation. On the other hand, throughout the\neighteenth and during the nineteenth century down to\nthe beginning of the Crimean War in 1854, England\nadhered to the rules of the Consolato del Mare . Thus,\nno generally accepted rules of International Law\nregarding private property on sea were in existence. [345] Matters were made worse by privateering, which was\ngenerally recognised as lawful, and by the fact that\nbelligerents frequently declared a coast blockaded\nwithout having a sufficient number of men-of-war on [Pg 220] the spot to make the blockade effective. It was not\nuntil the Declaration of Paris in 1856 that general rules\nof International Law regarding private property on\nsea came into existence.",

Although this alteration of attitude on the\npart of the belligerents was originally intended for the\nCrimean War only and exceptionally, it led after the\nconclusion of peace in 1856 to the famous and epoch-making\nDeclaration of Paris, [346] which enacted the four\nrules—(1) that privateering is abolished, (2) that the\nneutral flag covers enemy goods [347] with the exception\nof contraband of war, (3) that neutral goods, contraband\nof war excepted, are not liable to capture under the\nenemy flag, (4) that blockades, in order to be binding,\nmust be effective, which means maintained by a force\nsufficient really to prevent access to the coast of the\nenemy.

Public opinion in Great Britain was\nnot, and is not, prepared to consent to the abolition of\nthis rule. And there is no doubt that the abolition of\nthe rule would involve a certain amount of danger to a\ncountry like Great Britain whose position and power\ndepend chiefly upon her navy. The possibility of\nannihilating an enemy's commerce by annihilating his\nmerchant fleet is a powerful weapon in the hands of a\ngreat naval Power. Moreover, if enemy merchantmen\nare not captured, they can be fitted out as cruisers, or at\nleast be made use of for the transport of troops, munitions, [Pg 223] and provisions.

It is a matter for politicians, not for jurists,\nto decide whether Great Britain must in the interest of\nself-preservation oppose the abolition of the rule that\nsea-borne private enemy property may be confiscated.",
                                        "However this may be, since the end of the nineteenth\ncentury it has not been the attitude of Great Britain\nalone which stands in the way of the abolition of the\nrule. Since the growth of navies among continental\nPowers, these Powers have learnt to appreciate the\nvalue of the rule in war, and the outcry against the\ncapture of merchantmen has become less loud. To-day,\nit may perhaps be said that, even if Great Britain were\nto propose the abolition of the rule, it is probable that a\ngreater number of the maritime States would refuse to\naccede. For it should be noted that at the Second\nPeace Conference, France, Russia, Japan, Spain,\nPortugal, Mexico, Colombia, and Panama, besides\nGreat Britain, voted against the abolition of the rule.\nAnd there is noticeable a slow, but constant, increase\nin the number of continental publicists [354] who oppose [Pg 224] the abolition of the once so much objected to practice\nof capturing enemy merchantmen.",

                                        "(2) It is forbidden to lay automatic contact mines\noff the coasts and ports of the enemy, with the sole\nobject of intercepting commercial navigation (article 2). [361]",
                                        "(3) When anchored automatic contact mines are\nemployed, every possible precaution must be taken for\nthe security of peaceful navigation. The belligerents\nmust provide, as far as possible, for these mines becoming\nharmless after a limited time has elapsed, and,\nwhere the mines cease to be under observation, to\nnotify the danger zones as soon as military exigencies\npermit, by notice to mariners, which must also be\ncommunicated to the Governments through the diplomatic\nchannel (article 3). [Pg 229]",
                                        "(4) At the close of the war, each Power must remove\nthe mines laid by it. As regards anchored automatic\ncontact mines laid by one of the belligerents off the\ncoasts of the other, their position must be notified\nto the other party by the Power which laid them, and\neach Power must proceed with the least possible delay\nto remove the mines in its own waters (article 5).",
                                        "(5) The Convention remains in force for seven years,\nbut, unless denounced, it continues in force afterwards\n(article 11). According to article 12, however, the\ncontracting Powers agree to reopen the question of the\nemployment of automatic contact mines after six and\na half years unless the Third Peace Conference has\nalready taken up and settled the matter.",

Enemy vessels engaged in scientific discovery\nand exploration were, according to a general international\nusage in existence before the Second Peace\nConference of 1907, granted immunity from attack and\nseizure in so far and so long as they themselves abstained\nfrom hostilities. The usage grew up in the\neighteenth century. In 1766, the French explorer\nBougainville, who started from St. Malo with the\nvessels La Boudeuse and L'Étoile on a voyage round\nthe world, was furnished by the British Government\nwith safe-conducts. In 1776, Captain Cook's vessels Resolution and Discovery , sailing from Plymouth for the\npurpose of exploring the Pacific Ocean, were declared [Pg 233] exempt from attack and seizure on the part of French\ncruisers by the French Government. Again, the\nFrench Count Lapérouse, who started on a voyage of\nexploration in 1785 with the vessels Astrolabe and Boussole , was secured immunity from attack and\nseizure. During the nineteenth century this usage\nbecame quite general, and had almost ripened into a\ncustom; examples are the Austrian cruiser Novara (1859) and the Swedish cruiser Vega (1878). No\nimmunity, however, was granted to vessels charged\nwith religious or philanthropic missions. A remarkable\ncase occurred during the Franco-German war.\nIn June, 1871, the Palme , a vessel belonging to the\nMissionary Society of Basle, was captured by a French\nman-of-war, and condemned by the Prize Court of\nBordeaux. The owners appealed and the French\nConseil d'État set the vessel free, not because the\ncapture was not justified but because equity demanded\nthat the fact that Swiss subjects owning sea-going\nvessels were obliged to have them sailing under the flag\nof another State, should be taken into consideration.

                                        "§ 192. It has already been stated above, in § 185 ,\nthat the capture of a private enemy vessel has to\nbe confirmed by a Prize Court, and that it is only\nthrough the latter's adjudication that the vessel becomes\nfinally appropriated. The origin [379] of Prize\nCourts is to be traced back to the end of the Middle\nAges. During the Middle Ages, after the Roman Empire\nhad broken up, a state of lawlessness established itself\non the High Seas. Piratical vessels of the Danes\ncovered the North Sea and the Baltic, and navigation\nof the Mediterranean Sea was threatened by Greek and\nSaracen pirates. Merchantmen, therefore, associated\nthemselves for mutual protection and sailed as a\nmerchant fleet under a specially elected chief, the [Pg 239] so-called Admiral. They also occasionally sent out a\nfleet of armed vessels for the purpose of sweeping\npirates from certain parts of the High Seas. Piratical\nvessels and goods which were captured were divided\namong the captors according to a decision of their\nAdmiral. During the thirteenth century the maritime\nStates of Europe themselves endeavoured to keep\norder on the Open Sea. By-and-by armed vessels were\nobliged to be furnished with Letters Patent or Letters\nof Marque from the Sovereign of a maritime State and\ntheir captures submitted to the official control of such\nState as had furnished them with their Letters. A\nboard, called the Admiralty, was instituted by maritime\nStates, and officers of that Board of Admiralty exercised\ncontrol over the armed vessels and their captures,\ninquiring in each case [380] into the legitimation of the\ncaptor and the nationality of the captured vessel and\nher goods. And after modern International Law had\ngrown up, it was a recognised customary rule that in\ntime of war the Admiralty of maritime belligerents\nshould be obliged to institute a Court [381] or Courts\nwhenever a prize was captured by public vessels or\nprivateers in order to decide whether the capture was\nlawful or not. These Courts were called Prize Courts.\nThis institution has come down to our times, and\nnowadays all maritime States either constitute permanent\nPrize Courts, or appoint them specially in\neach case of an outbreak of war. The whole institution\nis essentially one in the interest of neutrals, since\nbelligerents want to be guarded by a decision of a\nCourt against claims of neutral States regarding alleged\nunjustified capture of neutral vessels and goods. The [Pg 240] capture of any private vessel, whether prima facie belonging\nto an enemy or a neutral, must, therefore, be\nsubmitted to a Prize Court. Article 1 of Convention XII.\n(as yet unratified) of the Second Peace Conference now\nexpressly enacts the old customary rule that \"the\nvalidity of the capture of a merchantman or its cargo,\nwhen neutral or enemy property is involved, is decided\nbefore a Prize Court.\" It must, however, be emphasised\nthat the ordinary Prize-Courts are not International\nCourts, but National Courts instituted by\nMunicipal Law, and that the law they administer is\nMunicipal Law, [382] based on custom, statutes, or special\nregulations of their State. Every State is, however,\nbound by International Law to enact only such statutes\nand regulations [383] for its Prize Courts as are in conformity\nwith International Law. A State may, therefore,\ninstead of making special regulations, directly\norder its Prize Courts to apply the rules of International\nLaw, and it is understood that, when no statutes are\nenacted or regulations are given, Prize Courts have to\napply International Law. Prize Courts may be instituted\nby belligerents in any part of their territory\nor the territories of allies, but not on neutral territory.\nIt would nowadays constitute a breach of neutrality on\nthe part of a neutral State to allow the institution on its\nterritory of a Prize Court.

Since through adjudication by the Prize\nCourts the ownership of captured private enemy vessels [Pg 243] becomes finally transferred to the belligerent whose\nforces made the capture, it is evident that after transfer\nthe captured vessel as well as her cargo may be destroyed.\nOn the other hand, it is likewise evident\nthat, since a verdict of a Prize Court is necessary before\nthe appropriation of the prize becomes final, a captured\nmerchantman must not as a rule be destroyed instead\nof being conducted to the port of a Prize Court. There\nare, however, exceptions to the rule, but no unanimity\nexists in theory or practice as regards those exceptions.\nWhereas some [387] consider the destruction of a prize\nallowable only in case of imperative necessity, others [388] allow it in nearly every case of convenience. Thus, the\nGovernment of the United States of America, on the\noutbreak of war with England in 1812, instructed the\ncommanders of her vessels to destroy at once all captures,\nthe very valuable excepted, because a single cruiser,\nhowever successful, could man a few prizes only, but\nby destroying each capture would be able to continue\ncapturing, and thereby constantly diminish the enemy\nmerchant fleet. [389] During the Civil War in America the\ncruisers of the Southern Confederated States destroyed\nall enemy prizes because there was no port open for\nthem to bring prizes to. And during the Russo-Japanese\nWar, Russian cruisers destroyed twenty-one\ncaptured Japanese merchantmen. [390] According to\nBritish practice, [391] the captor is allowed to destroy the\nprize in only two cases—namely, first, when the prize is\nin such a condition as prevents her from being sent to\nany port of adjudication; and, secondly, when the capturing\nvessel is unable to spare a prize crew to navigate [Pg 244] the prize into such a port. The Règlement international\ndes prises maritimes of the Institute of International\nLaw enumerates in § 50 five cases in which destruction\nof the capture is allowed—namely (1) when the condition\nof the vessel and the weather make it impossible\nto keep the prize afloat; (2) when the vessel navigates so\nslowly that she cannot follow the captor and is therefore\nexposed to an easy recapture by the enemy; (3)\nwhen the approach of a superior enemy force creates the\nfear that the prize might be recaptured by the enemy; (4)\nwhen the captor cannot spare a prize crew; (5) when the\nport of adjudication to which the prize might be taken\nis too far from the spot where the capture was made.\nBe that as it may, [392] in every case of destruction of\nthe vessel the captor must remove crew, ship papers,\nand, if possible, the cargo, before the destruction of\nthe prize, and must afterwards send crew, papers, and\ncargo to a port of a Prize Court for the purpose of satisfying\nthe latter that both the capture and the destruction\nwere lawful.",

A prize is lost—(1) when the captor intentionally\nabandons her, (2) when she escapes through\nbeing rescued by her own crew, or (3) when she is recaptured.\nJust as through capture the prize becomes,\naccording to International Law, the property of the\nbelligerent whose forces made the capture, provided\na Prize Court confirms the capture, so such property\nis lost when the prize vessel becomes abandoned, or\nescapes, or is recaptured. And it seems to be obvious,\nand everywhere recognised by Municipal Law, that as\nsoon as a captured enemy merchantman succeeds in\nescaping, the proprietorship of the former owners [Pg 247] revives ipso facto . But the case is different when a\ncaptured vessel, whose crew has been taken on board\nthe capturing vessel, is abandoned and afterwards\nmet and taken possession of by a neutral vessel or by\na vessel of her home State. It is certainly not for\nInternational Law to determine whether or not the\noriginal proprietorship revives through abandonment.\nThis is a matter for Municipal Law. The case of\nrecapture is different from escape. Here too Municipal\nLaw has to determine whether or no the former proprietorship\nrevives, since International Law lays down\nthe rule only that recapture takes the vessel out of the\nproperty of the enemy and brings her into the property\nof the belligerent whose forces made the recapture.\nMunicipal Law of the individual States has settled\nthe matter in different ways. Thus, Great Britain, by\nsection 40 of the Naval Prize Act, 1864, enacted that\nthe recaptured vessel, except when she has been used\nby the captor as a ship of war, shall be restored to her\nformer owner on his paying one-eighth to one-fourth,\nas the Prize Court may award, of her value as prize\nsalvage, no matter if the recapture was made before or\nafter the enemy Prize Court had confirmed the capture.

As regards the use of a false flag, it is by\nmost publicists considered perfectly lawful for a man-of-war\nto use a neutral's or the enemy's flag (1) when\nchasing an enemy vessel, (2) when trying to escape, and\n(3) for the purpose of drawing an enemy vessel into\naction. [421] On the other hand, it is universally agreed [Pg 263] that immediately before an attack a vessel must fly\nher national flag. Halleck (I. p. 568) relates the\nfollowing instance: In 1783 the Sybille , a French\nfrigate of thirty-eight guns, enticed the British man-of-war Hussar by displaying the British flag and intimating\nherself to be a distressed prize of a British captor. The Hussar approached to succour her, but the latter at\nonce attacked the Hussar without showing the French\nflag. She was, however, overpowered and captured,\nand the commander of the Hussar publicly broke the\nsword of the commander of the Sybille , whom he justly\naccused of perfidy, although the French commander\nwas acquitted when subsequently brought to trial by\nthe French Government. Again, Halleck (I. p. 568)\nrelates: In 1813 two merchants of New York carried\nout a plan for destroying the British man-of-war Ramillies in the following way. A schooner with some\ncasks of flour on deck was expressly laden with several\ncasks of gunpowder having trains leading from a\nspecies of gunlock, which, by the action of clockwork,\nwent off at a given time after it had been set.\nTo entice the Ramillies to seize her, the schooner came\nup, and the Ramillies then sent a boat with thirteen\nmen and a lieutenant to cut her off. Subsequently\nthe crew of the schooner abandoned her and she blew\nup with the lieutenant and his men on board.",

British practice—see Holland, Prize\nLaw , § 200—permits the use of false colours. U.S. Naval War Code,\narticle 7, forbids it altogether, whereas as late as 1898, during the\nwar with Spain in consequence of the Cuban insurrection, two American\nmen-of-war made use of the Spanish flag (see Perels, p. 183). And during\nthe war between Turkey and Russia, in 1877, Russian men-of-war in the\nBlack Sea made use of the Italian flag (see Martens, II. § 103, p. 566).\nThe question of the permissibility of the use of a neutral or enemy flag\nis answered in the affirmative, among others, by Ortolan, II. p. 29;\nFiore, III.

The question\nwhether or not such requisitions and contributions\nwould be lawful became of interest through an article\non naval warfare of the future, published in 1882 by\nthe French Admiral Aube in the Revue des Deux Mondes (vol. 50, p. 331). Aube pointed out that one of the tasks\nof the fleet in sea warfare of the future would be to\nattack and destroy by bombardment fortified and unfortified\nmilitary and commercial enemy coast towns,\nor at least to compel them mercilessly to requisitions\nand contributions. As during the British naval\nmanœuvres of 1888 and 1889 imaginary contributions\nwere imposed upon several coast towns, Hall (§ 140*) took\ninto consideration the question under what conditions\nrequisitions and contributions would be lawful in sea\nwarfare. He concluded, after careful consideration\nand starting from the principles regarding requisitions\nand contributions in land warfare, that such requisitions\nand contributions may be levied, provided a force is\nlanded which actually takes possession of the respective\ncoast town and establishes itself there, although only\ntemporarily, until the imposed requisitions and contributions [Pg 265] have been complied with; that, however,\nno requisitions or contributions could be demanded by\na single message sent on shore under threatened penalty\nof bombardment in case of refusal. There is no doubt\nthat Hall's arguments are, logically, correct; but it\nwas not at all certain that the naval Powers would\nadopt them, since neither the Institute of International\nLaw nor the U.S. Naval War Code had done so. [423] The\nSecond Hague Peace Conference has now settled the\nmatter through the Convention (IX.) concerning bombardment\nby naval forces in time of war which\namongst its thirteen articles includes two—3 and 4—dealing\nwith requisitions and contributions. This\nConvention has been signed, although with some\nreservations, by all the Powers represented at the\nConference except Spain, China, and Nicaragua, but\nChina and Nicaragua acceded later.

There is no doubt whatever that enemy\ncoast towns which are defended may be bombarded\nby naval forces, acting either independently or in\nco-operation with a besieging army. But before the\nSecond Peace Conference of 1907 the question was not\nsettled as to whether or not open and undefended coast\nplaces might be bombarded by naval forces. The\nInstitute of International Law in 1895, at its meeting\nat Cambridge, appointed a committee to investigate\nthe matter. The report [424] of this committee, drafted\nby Professor Holland with the approval of the Dutch\nGeneral Den Beer Portugael, and presented in 1896\nat the meeting at Venice, [425] is of such interest that it is\nadvisable to reproduce here a translation of the following\nchief parts:—",

The opinion of the Prince de Joinville\nhas been taken up by Admiral Aube in an article which appeared\nin the Revue des Deux Mondes in 1882. After having\nremarked that the ultimate object of war is to inflict the greatest\npossible damage to the enemy and that \"La richesse est le nerf\nde la guerre,\" he goes on as follows:—\"Tout ce qui frappe\nl'ennemi dans sa richesse devient non seulement légitime, mais\ns'impose comme obligatoire. Il faut donc s'attendre à voir les\nflottes cuirassées, maîtresses de la mer, tourner leur puissance\nd'attaque et déstruction, à défaut d'adversaires se dérobant à\nleurs coups, contre toutes les villes du littoral, fortifiées ou non, [Pg 267] pacifiques ou guerrières, les incendier, les ruiner, et tout au\nmoins les rançonner sans merci.

One of your\nreporters observed in a series of letters addressed to the Times that such acts are contrary to the rules of International Law as\nwell as to the practice of the present century. He maintained\nthat bombardment of an open town ought to be allowed only for\nthe purpose of obtaining requisitions in kind necessary for the\nenemy fleet and contributions instead of requisitions, further\nby the way of reprisal, and in case the town defends itself\nagainst occupation by enemy troops approaching on land....\nMost of the admirals and naval officers of England who took\npart in the lively correspondence which arose in the Times and\nother journals during the months of August and September 1880\ntook up a contrary attitude....",

Of special interest are articles 4 and 5 of\nthese rules, which run as follows:—",
                                        "Article 4. In virtue of the general principles above, the\nbombardment by a naval force of an open town, that is to say\none which is not defended by fortifications or by other means\nof attack or of resistance for immediate defence, or by detached\nforts situated in proximity, for example of the maximum distance\nof from four to ten kilometres, is inadmissible except in the\nfollowing cases:—",
                                        "(1) For the purpose of obtaining by requisitions or contributions\nwhat is necessary for the fleet. These requisitions\nor contributions must in every case remain within the limits\nprescribed by articles 56 and 58 of the Manual of the Institute.",
                                        "(2) For the purpose of destroying sheds, military erections, [Pg 268] depôts of war munitions, or of war vessels in a port. Further,\nan open town which defends itself against the entrance of troops\nor of disembarked marines can be bombarded for the purpose\nof protecting the disembarkation of the soldiers and of the\nmarines, if the open town attempts to prevent it, and as an\nauxiliary measure of war to facilitate the result made by the\ntroops and the disembarked marines, if the town defends itself.\nBombardments of which the object is only to exact a ransom are\nspecially forbidden, and, with the stronger reason, those which\nare intended only to bring about the submission of the country\nby the destruction, for which there is no other motive, of the\npeaceful inhabitants or of their property.",
                                        "Article 5. An open town cannot be exposed to a bombardment\nfor the only reasons:—",
                                        "( a ) That it is the capital of the State or the seat of the\nGovernment (but naturally these circumstances do not guarantee\nit in any way against a bombardment).",

                                        "The First Peace Conference did not settle the\nmatter, but expressed the desire \"that the proposal to\nsettle the question of bombardment of ports, towns,\nand villages by a naval force may be referred to a subsequent\nConference for consideration.\" The Second\nPeace Conference, however, by Convention IX.—see\nabove, § 212 , p. 265—has provided detailed rules concerning\nall the points in question, and the following\nis now the law concerning bombardment by naval\nforces:—",
                                        "(1) The bombardment of undefended ports, towns,\nvillages, dwellings, or other buildings is under all\ncircumstances and conditions prohibited (article 1). To\ndefine the term \"undefended,\" article 1 expressly enacts\nthat \"a place cannot be bombarded solely because\nautomatic submarine contact mines are anchored off\nthe harbour,\" but Great Britain, France, Germany,\nand Japan entered a reservation against this, since\nthey correctly consider such a place to be \"defended.\" [Pg 269]",
                                        "(2) Although undefended places themselves are\nexempt, nevertheless military works, military or naval\nestablishments, depôts of arms or war material, workshops\nor plant which could be utilised for the needs of\nthe hostile fleet or army, and men-of-war in the harbour\nof undefended places may be bombarded. And no responsibility\nis incurred for any unavoidable damage\ncaused thereby to the undefended place or its inhabitants.\nAs a rule, however, the commander must,\nbefore resorting to bombardment of these works, ships,\nand the like, give warning to the local authorities so\nthat they can destroy the works and vessels themselves.\nOnly if, for military reasons, immediate action\nis necessary and no delay can be allowed to the enemy,\nmay bombardment be resorted to without previous\nwarning, the commander being compelled to take all due\nmeasures in order that the undefended place itself may\nsuffer as little harm as possible (article 2).",
                                        "The first case in which naval forces acted according\nto these rules occurred during the Turco-Italian war.\nOn February 25, 1912, Admiral Faravelli, the commander\nof an Italian squadron, surprised, at dawn, the\nTurkish gunboat Awni-Illa and a torpedo-boat in the\nport of Beirut. These vessels were called upon to surrender,\nthey were given until nine o'clock a.m. to\ncomply with the demand, and the demand was communicated\nto the Governor and the Consular authorities.\nAt nine o'clock the Turkish vessels were again,\nby signal, summoned to surrender, and as no reply was\nreceived, they were fired at and destroyed, but not\nwithout first having vigorously answered the fire of the\nItalians. Shells missing the vessels and bursting on\nthe quay killed and wounded a number of individuals\nand damaged several buildings. The Turkish Government\nprotested against this procedure as a violation of\nConvention IX. of the Second Peace Conference, but, [Pg 270] provided the official report of Admiral Faravelli\ncorresponds with the facts, the Turkish protest is\nunfounded.",
                                        "(3) In case undefended places do not comply with\nlegitimate requisitions, they likewise may be bombarded;\nsee details above, § 212 .",
                                        "(4) In case of bombardments, all necessary steps\nmust be taken to spare buildings devoted to public\nworship, art, science, or charitable purposes; historical\nmonuments; hospitals, and places where the sick or\nwounded are collected, provided they are not at the\ntime used for military purposes. To enable the attacking\nforce to carry out this injunction, the privileged\nbuildings, monuments, and places must be indicated\nby visible signs, which shall consist of large stiff rectangular\npanels, divided diagonally into two coloured\ntriangular portions, the upper portion black, the\nlower portion white (article 5). Unless military\nexigencies render it impossible the commander of an\nattacking naval force must, before commencing the\nbombardment, do all in his power to warn the authorities\n(article 6).",
                                        "(5) The giving over to pillage of a town or place,\neven when taken by assault, is forbidden (article 7). [Pg 271]"

If the Municipal Law of one\nor both belligerents does contain such a prohibition, it\nis of course within the discretion of one or both of them\nto grant exceptional licences to trade to their own or\nthe other belligerent's subjects, and such licences\nnaturally include certain privileges. Thus, for instance,\nif a belligerent allows enemy subjects to trade\nwith his own subjects, enemy merchantmen engaged in\nsuch trade are exempt from capture and appropriation\nby the grantor. Yet it is not International Law which\ncreates this exemption, but the very licence to trade\ngranted by the belligerent and revocable at any\nmoment; and no non-hostile international relations\nbetween the belligerents themselves originate from\nsuch licences.

Invincible from the harbour, whereupon\nH.M. ships Temeraire and Inflexible , which had just\ncommenced firing, were ordered to suspend fire. So\nsoon as the firing ceased, the boat, instead of going to\nthe Invincible , returned to the harbour. A flag of\ntruce was simultaneously hoisted by the rebels on the\nRas-el-Tin fort. These deceits gave the rebels time to\nleave the works and to retire through the town, abandoning\nthe forts, and withdrawing the whole of their\ngarrison under the flag of truce.\""

Meanwhile,\nhowever, circumstances had entirely changed. When\nGeneral Kléber had on March 17, 1800, received Lord\nKeith's letter of January 8, he addressed a proclamation, [451] in which Lord Keith's letter was embodied, to his\ntroops asking them to prepare themselves for battle\nand actually began hostilities again on March 20.

Usually, although\nnot at all necessarily, the parties embody special conditions\nin the agreement instituting an armistice. If\nand so far as this has not been done, the import of\narmistices is for some parts much controverted. Everybody\nagrees that belligerents during an armistice may,\noutside the line where the forces face each other, do\neverything and anything they like regarding defence\nand preparation of offence; for instance, they may\nmanufacture and import munitions and guns, drill\nrecruits, build fortresses, concentrate or withdraw\ntroops. But no unanimity exists regarding such acts\nas must be left undone or may be done within the very\nline where the belligerent forces face each other. The [Pg 295] majority of writers, led by Vattel (III. § 245), maintain\nthat in the absence of special stipulations it is essentially\nimplied in an armistice that within such line no alteration\nof the status quo shall take place which the other party,\nwere it not for the armistice, could by application of\nforce, for instance by a cannonade or by some other\nmeans, prevent from taking place. These writers\nconsider it a breach of faith for a belligerent to make\nsuch alterations under the protection of the armistice.\nOn the other hand, a small minority of writers, but led\nby Grotius (III. c. 21, § 7) and Pufendorf (VIII. 7, § 7),\nassert that cessation of hostilities and of further advance\nonly are essentially implied in an armistice; all other\nacts, such as strengthening of positions by concentration\nof more troops on the spot, erection and strengthening\nof defences, repairing of breaches of besieged\nfortresses, withdrawing of troops, making of fresh\nbatteries on the part of besiegers without advancing,\nand the like, being allowed. As the Hague Regulations\ndo not mention the matter, the controversy still remains\nunsettled. I believe the opinion of the minority\nto be correct, since an armistice does not mean anything\nelse than a cessation of actual hostilities, and\nit is for the parties who agree upon an armistice to\nstipulate such special conditions as they think necessary\nor convenient. This applies particularly to the other\ncontroversial questions as to revictualling of besieged\nplaces and as to intercourse, commercial and otherwise,\nof the inhabitants of the region where actual\nfighting was going on before the armistice. As regards\nrevictualling, it has been correctly maintained\nthat, if it were not allowed, the position of the besieged\nforces would thereby be weakened by the action\nof the armistice. But I cannot see why this should\nbe an argument to hold revictualling permissible. The\nprinciple vigilantibus jura sunt scripta applies to armistices [Pg 296] as well as to all other legal transactions. It is for\nthe parties to prepare such arrangements as really\nsuit their needs and wants. Thus, during the Franco-German\nWar an armistice for twenty-five days proposed\nin November 1870 fell to the ground on the Germans\nrefusing to grant the revictualling of Paris. [457] It seems\nto be the intention of the Hague Regulations that the\nparties should always stipulate those special conditions\nwhich they need. Article 39 pronounces this intention\nregarding intercourse, commercial and otherwise, during\narmistices, by the following words:—\"It is for the\ncontracting parties to settle in the terms of the armistice\nwhat communications may be held within the theatre\nof war with the population and with each other.\"",

But often the parties stipulate in\nthe agreement the time from which the armistice shall\nbegin. If this is done in so detailed a manner that\nthe very hour of the commencement is mentioned,\nno cause for controversy is given. But sometimes\nthe parties fix only the date by stipulating that the\narmistice shall last from one certain day to another, e.g. from June 15 to July 15. In such case the actual\ncommencement is controversial. Most publicists maintain [Pg 297] that in such case the armistice begins at 12 o'clock\nof the night between the 14th and the 15th of June,\nbut Grotius (III. c. 21, § 4) maintains that it begins at\n12 o'clock of the night between the 15th and the 16th\nof June.

No unanimity regarding this\npoint exists among the writers on International Law,\nmany [461] asserting that in case of violation the other\nparty may at once, without giving notice, re-open\nhostilities; others [462] maintaining that such party may not\ndo this, but has only the right to denounce the armistice.\nThe Hague Regulations endeavour to settle the controversy,\narticle 40 enacting that any serious violation\nof an armistice by one of the parties gives the other the\nright to denounce it, and even, in case of urgency, to\nrecommence hostilities at once. Three rules may be\nformulated from this—(1) violations which are not\nserious do not even give the right to denounce an\narmistice; (2) serious violations do as a rule empower\nthe other party to denounce only the armistice, but\nnot to recommence hostilities at once without notice;\n(3) only in case of urgency is a party justified in recommencing\nhostilities without notice, when the other\nparty has broken an armistice. But since the terms\n\"serious violation\" and \"urgency\" lack precise definition,\nit is practically left to the discretion of the\ninjured party.",

In the former\ncase the injured party has, according to article 41 of [Pg 299] the Hague Regulations, only the right of demanding\npunishment of the offenders, and, if necessary, indemnity\nfor losses sustained.",

Lippencott was, however, acquitted\nby the court-martial, as there was evidence to show\nthat his command to execute Huddy was in accordance\nwith orders of a Board which he was bound to obey.\nThereupon some British officers who were prisoners of\nwar in the hands of the Americans were directed to\ncast lots to determine who should be executed by way\nof reprisal for the execution of Huddy. The lot fell\non Captain Asgill, a young officer only nineteen years\nold, and he would have been executed but for the\nmediation of the Queen of France, who saved his life. [474]",

Under\nthis act, General Dearborn placed in close confinement\ntwenty-three prisoners taken at Fort George. General\nPrevost, under express directions of Lord Bathurst,\nordered the close imprisonment of double the number of\ncommissioned and non-commissioned United States'\nofficers. This was followed by a threat of 'unmitigated\nseverity against the American citizens and villages'\nin case the system of retaliation was pursued. Mr.\nMadison having retorted by putting in confinement a\nsimilar number of British officers taken by the United\nStates, General Prevost immediately retorted by subjecting\nto the same discipline all his prisoners whatsoever....\nA better temper, however, soon came over\nthe British Government, by whom this system had\nbeen instituted. A party of United States' officers,\nwho were prisoners of war in England, were released on [Pg 308] parole, with instructions to state to the President that\nthe twenty-three prisoners who had been charged with\ntreason in England had not been tried, but remained\non the usual basis of prisoners of war.

It was frequently resorted\nto in cases in which belligerent forces depended\nmore or less upon each other's good faith, such as\ncapitulations and armistices for instance. To make\nsure that no perfidy was intended, officers or prominent\nprivate individuals were taken as hostages and could be\nheld responsible with their lives for any perfidy committed\nby the enemy. This practice has totally disappeared,\nand is hardly likely to be revived. But\nthis former practice must not be confounded with the\nstill existing practice of seizing enemy individuals\nfor the purpose of making them the object of reprisals.\nThus, when in 1870, during the Franco-German War,\nCount Bismarck ordered forty French notables to be\nseized and to be taken away into captivity as a retaliation\nupon the French for refusing to liberate the\ncrews of forty captured merchantmen, these forty\nFrench notables were not taken as hostages, but were\nmade the object of reprisals.

A new practice of taking hostages was resorted\nto by the Germans in 1870 during the Franco-German\nWar for the purpose of securing the safety of [Pg 318] forces against possible hostile acts on the part of private\ninhabitants of occupied enemy territory. Well-known\nmen were seized and detained in the expectation that\nthe population would refrain from hostile acts out of\nregard for the fate of the hostages. Thus, when unknown\npeople frequently wrecked the trains transporting\ntroops, the Germans seized prominent enemy\ncitizens and put them on the engines of trains to prevent\nthe latter from being wrecked, a means which always\nproved effective and soon put a stop to further train-wrecking.\nThe same practice was resorted to, although\nfor a short time only, by Lord Roberts [487] in 1900\nduring the South African War. This practice has been\ncondemned by the majority of publicists. But, with all\ndue deference to the authority of so many prominent men\nwho oppose the practice, I cannot agree with their\nopinion. Matters would be different if hostages were\nseized and exposed to dangers for the purpose of preventing\nlegitimate hostilities on the part of members\nof the armed forces of the enemy. [488] But no one can\ndeny that train-wrecking on occupied enemy territory\nby private enemy individuals is an act which a belligerent\nis justified in considering and punishing as war\ntreason. [489] It is for the purpose of guarding against an\nact of illegitimate warfare that these hostages are put\non the engines. The danger they are exposed to comes\nfrom their fellow-citizens, who are informed of the fact\nthat hostages are on the engines and who ought therefore\nto refrain from wrecking the trains. It cannot,\nand will not, be denied that the measure is a harsh one,\nand that it makes individuals liable to suffer for acts [Pg 319] for which they are not responsible. But the safety of\nhis troops and lines of communication is at stake for\nthe belligerent concerned, and I doubt, therefore,\nwhether even the most humane commanders will be\nable to dispense with this measure, since it alone has\nproved effective. And it must further be taken into\nconsideration that the amount of cruelty connected\nwith it is no greater than in reprisals where also innocent\nindividuals must suffer for illegitimate acts for which\nthey are not responsible. And is it not more reasonable\nto prevent train-wrecking by putting hostages on the\nengines than to resort to reprisals for wreckage of trains?\nFor there is no doubt that a belligerent is justified in\nresorting to reprisals [490] in each case of train-wrecking\nby private enemy individuals.

For instance, if the\ncommander of a naval force, in contravention of\nConvention IX. of the Second Peace Conference, were\nto bombard an undefended place, compensation could\nbe claimed for such subjects of the enemy and subjects\nof neutral States as suffered damage through the\nbombardment.",

Since in the case of termination of war\nthrough simple cessation of hostilities no treaty of\npeace embodies the conditions of peace between the\nformer belligerents, the question arises whether the status which existed between the parties before the\noutbreak of war, the status quo ante bellum , should be\nrevived, or the status which exists between the parties at\nthe time when they simply ceased hostilities, the status\nquo post bellum (the uti possidetis ), can be upheld. The\nmajority of publicists [495] correctly maintain that the status which exists at the time of cessation of hostilities\nbecomes silently recognised through such cessation,\nand is, therefore, the basis of the future relations of the\nparties. This question is of the greatest importance\nregarding enemy territory militarily occupied by a\nbelligerent at the time hostilities cease. According to\nthe correct opinion such territory can be annexed by\nthe occupier, the adversary through the cessation of\nhostilities having dropped all rights he possessed over\nsuch territory. On the other hand, this termination of\nwar through cessation of hostilities contains no decision\nregarding such claims of the parties as have not been\nsettled by the actual position of affairs at the termination\nof hostilities, and it remains for the parties to settle\nthem by special agreement or to let them stand over.",

Conquest is taking possession of enemy\nterritory by military force. Conquest is completed as\nsoon as the territory concerned is effectively [496] occupied.\nNow it is obvious that conquest of a part of enemy\nterritory has nothing to do with subjugation, because\nthe enemy may well reconquer it. But even the conquest\nof the whole of the enemy territory need not\nnecessarily include subjugation. For, first, in a war\nbetween more than two belligerents the troops of one\nof them may evacuate their country and join the army\nof allies, so that the armed contention is continued,\nalthough the territory of one of the allies is completely\nconquered. Again, a belligerent, although he has\nannihilated the forces, conquered the whole of the\nterritory of his adversary, and thereby actually brought\nthe armed contention to an end, [497] may nevertheless not\nchoose to exterminate the enemy State by annexing the\nconquered territory, but may conclude a treaty of [Pg 326] peace with the expelled or imprisoned head of the\ndefeated State, re-establish the latter's Government,\nand hand the whole or a part of the conquered territory\nover to it.

[510] It is\nusual, but not at all necessary, to insert an amnesty\nclause in a treaty of peace.

Individuals\nwho have committed such war crimes and\nhave been arrested for them must be liberated.

Formerly even claims\nfor reparation of damages caused by such acts could not\nbe raised after the conclusion of peace, unless the contrary\nwas expressly stipulated, but the matter is different\nnow in accordance with article 3 of Convention IV.\nof the Second Peace Conference.

Whereas, on the whole, the duty of neutrals\nto remain impartial and the duty of belligerents to\nrespect neutral territory became generally recognised\nduring the eighteenth century, the members of the\nFamily of Nations did not come to an agreement during\nthis period regarding the treatment of neutral vessels\ntrading with belligerents. It is true that the right of\nvisit and search for contraband of war and the right to\nseize the latter was generally recognised, but in other\nrespects no general theory and practice was agreed\nupon. France and Spain upheld the rule that neutral\ngoods on enemy ships as well as neutral ships carrying\nenemy goods could be seized by belligerents. Although\nEngland granted from time to time, by special treaties\nwith special States, the rule \"Free ship, free goods,\"\nher general practice throughout the eighteenth century\nfollowed the rule of the Consolato del Mare , according\nto which enemy goods on neutral vessels may be confiscated,\nwhereas neutral goods on enemy vessels must\nbe restored. England, further, upheld the principle\nthat the commerce of neutrals should in time of war\nbe restricted to the same limits as in time of peace, since\nmost States in time of peace reserved cabotage and\ntrade with their colonies to vessels of their own merchant\nmarine. It was in 1756 that this principle first came [Pg 353] into question. In this year, during war with England,\nFrance found that on account of the naval superiority\nof England she was unable to carry on her colonial\ntrade by her own merchant marine, and she, therefore,\nthrew open this trade to vessels of the Netherlands,\nwhich had remained neutral. England, however,\nordered her fleet to seize all such vessels with their\ncargoes on the ground that they had become incorporated\nwith the French merchant marine, and had\nthereby acquired enemy character. From this time\nthe above principle is commonly called the \"rule [535] of 1756.\" England, thirdly, followed other Powers in\nthe practice of declaring enemy coasts to be blockaded\nand condemning captured neutral vessels for breach of\nblockade, although the blockades were by no means\nalways effective.",

Stress must be laid on the fact that the original\nmeaning of the rule of 1756 is different from the meaning it received by\nits extension in 1793. From that year onwards England not only\nconsidered those neutral vessels which embarked upon the French coasting\nand colonial trade thrown open to them during the war with England, as\nhaving acquired enemy character, but likewise those neutral vessels\nwhich carried neutral goods from neutral ports to ports of a French\ncolony. This extension of the rule of 1756 was clearly unjustified, and\nit is not possible to believe that it will ever be revived.]",
                                        "As privateering was legitimate and in general\nuse, neutral commerce was considerably disturbed\nduring every war between naval States. Now in 1780,\nduring war between Great Britain, her American\ncolonies, France, and Spain, Russia sent a circular [536] to England, France, and Spain, in which she proclaimed\nthe following five principles: (1) That neutral\nvessels should be allowed to navigate from port to port\nof belligerents and along their coasts; (2) that enemy\ngoods on neutral vessels, contraband excepted, should\nnot be seized by belligerents; (3) that, with regard to\ncontraband, articles 10 and 11 of the treaty of 1766 [Pg 354] between Russia and Great Britain should be applied in\nall cases; (4) that a port should only be considered\nblockaded if the blockading belligerent had stationed\nvessels there, so as to create an obvious danger for\nneutral vessels entering the port; (5) that these principles\nshould be applied in the proceedings and judgments\non the legality of prizes. In July and August\n1780, Russia [537] entered into a treaty, first with Denmark\nand then with Sweden, for the purpose of enforcing\nthose principles by equipping a number of men-of-war.\nThus the \"Armed Neutrality\" made its appearance.\nIn 1781, the Netherlands, Prussia, and Austria, in 1782\nPortugal, and in 1783 the Two Sicilies joined the league.\nFrance, Spain, and the United States of America accepted\nthe principles of the league without formally\njoining. The war between England, the United States,\nFrance, and Spain was terminated in 1783, and the war\nbetween England and the Netherlands in 1784, but in\nthe treaties of peace the principles of the \"Armed\nNeutrality\" were not mentioned. This league had no\ndirect practical consequences, since England retained\nher former standpoint. Moreover, some of the States\nthat had joined the league acted contrary to some of\nits principles when they themselves went to war—as\ndid Sweden during her war with Russia 1788-1790, and\nFrance and Russia in 1793—and some of them concluded\ntreaties in which were stipulations at variance\nwith those principles. Nevertheless, the First Armed\nNeutrality has proved of great importance, because its\nprinciples have furnished the basis of the Declaration\nof Paris of 1856.",

The Second Armed\nNeutrality was caused by the refusal of England to\nconcede immunity from visit and search to neutral\nmerchantmen under convoy. [538] Sweden was the first\nto claim in 1653, during war between Holland and\nGreat Britain, that the belligerents should not visit\nand search Swedish merchantmen under convoy of\nSwedish men-of-war, provided a declaration was made\nby the men-of-war that the merchantmen had no\ncontraband on board. Other States later raised the\nsame claim, and many treaties were concluded which\nstipulated the immunity from visit and search of neutral\nmerchantmen under convoy. But Great Britain refused\nto recognise the principle, and when, in July 1800, a\nBritish squadron captured a Danish man-of-war and\nher convoy of several merchantmen for having resisted\nvisit and search, Russia invited Sweden, Denmark, and\nPrussia to renew the \"Armed Neutrality,\" and to add\nto its principles the further one, that belligerents should\nnot have a right of visit and search in case the commanding\nofficer of the man-of-war, under whose convoy [Pg 356] neutral merchantmen were sailing, should declare that\nthe convoyed vessels did not carry contraband of war.\nIn December 1800 Russia concluded treaties with\nSweden, Denmark, and Prussia consecutively, by\nwhich the \"Second Armed Neutrality\" became a fact. [539] But it lasted only a year on account of the assassination\nof the Emperor Paul of Russia on March 23, and the\ndefeat of the Danish fleet by Nelson on April 2, 1801,\nin the battle of Copenhagen. Nevertheless, the Second\nArmed Neutrality likewise proved of importance, for it\nled to a compromise in the \"Maritime Convention\"\nconcluded by England and Russia under the Emperor\nAlexander I. on June 17, 1801, at St. Petersburg. [540] By article 3 of this treaty, England recognised, as far as\nRussia was concerned, the rules that neutral vessels\nmight navigate from port to port and on the coasts\nof belligerents, and that blockades must be effective.\nBut in the same article England enforced recognition by\nRussia of the rule that enemy goods on neutral vessels\nmay be seized, and she did not recognise the immunity\nof neutral vessels under convoy from visit and search,\nalthough, by article 4, she conceded that the right of\nvisit and search should be exercised only by men-of-war,\nand not by privateers, in case the neutral vessels concerned\nsailed under convoy.",

                                        "(1) The most prominent and influential factor is\nthe attitude of the United States of America towards\nneutrality from 1793 to 1818. When in 1793 England\njoined the war which had broken out in 1792 between\nthe so-called First Coalition and France, Genêt, the\nFrench diplomatic envoy accredited to the United\nStates, granted Letters of Marque to American merchantmen\nmanned by American citizens in American\nports. These privateers were destined to cruise against\nEnglish vessels, and French Prize Courts were set up\nby the French Minister in connection with French consulates\nin American ports. On the complaint of Great\nBritain, the Government of the United States ordered [Pg 358] these privateers to be disarmed and the French Prize\nCourts to be disorganised. [544] As the trial of Gideon\nHenfield, [545] who was acquitted, proved that the Municipal\nLaw of the United States did not prohibit the\nenlistment of American citizens in the service of a\nforeign belligerent, Congress in 1794 passed an Act\ntemporarily forbidding American citizens to accept\nLetters of Marque from a foreign belligerent and to\nenlist in the army or navy of a foreign State, and forbidding\nthe fitting out and arming of vessels intended\nas privateers for foreign belligerents. Other Acts were\npassed from time to time. Finally, on April 20, 1818,\nCongress passed the Foreign Enlistment Act, which\ndeals definitely with the matter, and is still in force, [546] and which afforded the basis of the British Foreign\nEnlistment Act of 1819. The example of the United\nStates initiated the present practice, according to\nwhich it is the duty of neutrals to prevent the fitting\nout and arming on their territory of cruisers for belligerents,\nto prevent enlistment on their territory for\nbelligerents, and the like.",
                                        "[Footnote 544: See Wharton, III. §§ 395-396.]",

                                        "(2) Of great importance for the development of\nneutrality during the nineteenth century became the\npermanent neutralisation of Switzerland and Belgium.\nThese States naturally adopted and retained throughout\nevery war an exemplary attitude of impartiality\ntowards the belligerents. And each time war broke\nout in their vicinity they took effectual military\nmeasures for the purpose of preventing belligerents\nfrom making use of their neutral territory and\nresources.",
                                        "(3) The third factor is the Declaration of Paris of\n1856, which incorporated into International Law the\nrule \"Free ship, free goods,\" the rule that neutral [Pg 359] goods on enemy ships cannot be appropriated, and\nthe rule that blockade must be effective.",
                                        "(4) The fourth and last factor is the general development\nof the military and naval resources of all\nmembers of the Family of Nations. As all the larger\nStates were, during the second half of the nineteenth\ncentury, obliged to keep their armies and navies at\nevery moment ready for war, it followed as a consequence\nthat, whenever war broke out, each belligerent\nwas anxious not to injure neutral States in order to\navoid their taking the part of the enemy. On the\nother hand, neutral States were always anxious to\nfulfil the duties of neutrality for fear of being drawn\ninto the war. Thus the general rule, that the development\nof International Law has been fostered by the\ninterests of the members of the Family of Nations,\napplies also to the special case of neutrality. But for\nthe fact that it is to the interest of belligerents to\nremain during war on good terms with neutrals, and\nthat it is to the interest of neutrals not to be drawn\ninto war, the institution of neutrality would never have\ndeveloped so favourably as it actually did during the\nnineteenth century."

Whether\nor not a third State will adopt and preserve an attitude\nof impartiality during war is not a matter for International\nLaw but for International Politics. Therefore,\nunless a previous treaty stipulates it expressly, no duty\nexists for a State, according to International Law, to\nremain neutral in war. On the other hand, it ought\nnot to be maintained, although this is done by some\nwriters, [551] that every State has by the Law of Nations a\nright not to remain neutral. The fact is that every\nSovereign State, as an independent member of the\nFamily of Nations, is master of its own resolutions, and [Pg 362] that the question of remaining neutral or not is, in\nabsence of a treaty stipulating otherwise, one of policy\nand not of law. However, all States which do not\nexpressly declare the contrary by word or action, are\nsupposed to be neutral, and the rights and duties\narising from neutrality come into and remain in\nexistence through the mere fact that a State takes up\nand preserves an attitude of impartiality and is not\ndrawn into the war by the belligerents themselves.

As civil war becomes\nreal war through recognition [558] of the insurgents as a [Pg 366] belligerent Power, a distinction must be made as to\nwhether recognition has taken place or not. There is no\ndoubt that a foreign State commits an international\ndelinquency by assisting insurgents in spite of its\nbeing at peace with the legitimate Government. But\nmatters are different after recognition. The insurgents\nare now a belligerent Power, and the civil war is now\nreal war. Foreign States can either become a party\nto the war or remain neutral, and in the latter case\nall duties and rights of neutrality devolve upon them.\nSince, however, recognition may be granted by foreign\nStates independently of the attitude of the legitimate\nGovernment, and since recognition granted by the\nlatter is not at all binding upon foreign Governments,\nit may happen that insurgents are granted recognition\non the part of the legitimate Government, whereas\nforeign States refuse it, and vice versa . [559] In the first\ncase, the rights and duties of neutrality devolve upon\nforeign States as far as the legitimate Government is\nconcerned. Men-of-war of the latter may visit and\nsearch merchantmen of foreign States for contraband;\na blockade declared by the legitimate Government is\nbinding upon foreign States, and the like. But no\nrights and duties of neutrality devolve upon foreign\nStates as regards the insurgents. A blockade declared\nby them is not binding, their men-of-war may not\nvisit and search merchantmen for contraband. On\nthe other hand, if insurgents are recognised by a foreign\nState but not by the legitimate Government, such\nforeign State has all rights and duties of neutrality\nso far as the insurgents are concerned, but not so\nfar as the legitimate Government is concerned. [560] In [Pg 367] practice, however, recognition of insurgents on the\npart of foreign States will, if really justified, always\nhave the effect of causing the legitimate Government\nto grant its recognition also.",

History\nreports many cases in which States, although they\nintended to remain neutral, were obliged by one or\nboth belligerents to make up their minds and choose\nthe belligerent with whom they would throw in their\nlot. For neutrality to come into existence it is, therefore,\nnot sufficient for a third State at the outbreak of\nwar to take up an attitude of impartiality, but it is also\nnecessary that the belligerents recognise this attitude\nby acquiescing in it and by not treating such third\nState as a party to the war. This does not mean, as\nhas been maintained, [562] that neutrality is based on a\ncontract concluded either expressis verbis or by unmistakable\nactions between the belligerents and third\nStates, and that, consequently, a third State might at\nthe outbreak of war take up the position of one which\nis neither neutral nor a party to the war, reserving\nthereby for itself freedom in its future resolutions and\nactions.

                                        "§ 305. A distinction of great practical importance\nwas in former times that between perfect, or absolute,\nand qualified, or imperfect, neutrality. The neutrality\nof a State was qualified if it remained neutral on the\nwhole, but actively or passively, directly or indirectly,\ngave some kind of assistance to one of the belligerents in\nconsequence of an obligation entered into by a treaty\nprevious to the war, and not for the special war exclusively.\nOn the other hand, a neutrality was termed\nperfect if a neutral State neither actively nor passively,\nand neither directly nor indirectly, favoured either\nbelligerent. There is no doubt that in the eighteenth\ncentury, when it was recognised that a State could be\nconsidered neutral, although it was by a previous\ntreaty bound to render more or less limited assistance\nto one of the belligerents, this distinction between\nneutrality perfect and qualified was justified. But\nduring the second half of the nineteenth century it [Pg 371] became controversial whether a so-called qualified\nneutrality was neutrality at all, and whether a State,\nwhich, in fulfilment of a treaty obligation, rendered\nsome assistance to one of the belligerents, violated its\nneutrality. The majority of modern writers [566] maintained,\ncorrectly I think, that a State was either neutral\nor not, and that a State violated its neutrality in case\nit rendered any assistance whatever to one of the\nbelligerents from any motive whatever. For this\nreason, a State which had entered into such obligations\nas those just mentioned would in time of war frequently\nbe in a conflict of duties. For, in fulfilling its treaty\nobligations, it would frequently be obliged to violate its\nduty of neutrality, and vice versa . Several writers, [567] however, maintained that such fulfilment of treaty\nobligations would not contain a violation of neutrality.\nAll doubt in the matter ought now to be removed, since\narticle 2 of Convention V. of the Second Peace Conference\ncategorically enacts that \"belligerents are forbidden\nto move across the territory of a neutral Power troops\nor convoys either of munitions of war or of supplies.\"\nThe principle at the back of this enactment no doubt is\nthat a qualified neutrality has no longer any raison d'être ,\nand that neutrality must in every case be perfect.

When, in 1788, during war between Russia\nand Sweden, Denmark fulfilled her obligations towards\nRussia, she nevertheless declared herself neutral.

Since neutrality is an attitude of impartiality\ndeliberately taken up by a State not implicated in a\nwar, neutrality cannot begin before the outbreak of\nwar becomes known. It is only then that third States\ncan make up their minds whether or not they intend to\nremain neutral. They are supposed to remain neutral,\nand the duties deriving from neutrality are incumbent\nupon them so long as they do not expressis verbis or by\nunmistakable acts declare that they will be parties to\nthe war. It had long been the usual practice on the\npart of belligerents to notify the outbreak of war to\nthird States for the purpose of enabling them to take\nup the necessary attitude of impartiality, but such\nnotification was not formerly in strict law necessary.\nThe mere fact of the knowledge of the outbreak of war\nwhich had been obtained in any way gave a third State\nan opportunity of making up its mind regarding the\nattitude which it intended to take up, and, if it remained\nneutral, its neutrality was to be dated from the time\nof its knowledge of the outbreak of war.

Some writers [584] maintain that no rights\nderive from neutrality for neutrals, and, consequently,\nno duties for belligerents, because everything which\nmust be left undone by a belligerent regarding his\nrelations with a neutral must likewise be left undone\nin time of peace. But this opinion has no foundation.\nIndeed, it is true that the majority of the acts which\nbelligerents must leave undone in consequence of their\nduty to respect neutrality must likewise be left undone\nin time of peace in consequence of the territorial\nsupremacy of every State. However, there are several\nacts which do not belong to this class—for instance,\nthe non-appropriation of enemy goods on neutral vessels. [Pg 380] And those acts which do belong to this class fall nevertheless\nat the same time under another category.\nThus, a violation of neutral territory on the part of a\nbelligerent for military and naval purposes of the war\nis indeed an act prohibited in time of peace, because\nevery State has to respect the territorial supremacy of\nother States; but it is at the same time a violation of\nneutrality, and therefore totally different from other\nviolations of foreign territorial supremacy. This becomes\nquite apparent when the true inwardness of such\nacts is regarded. For every State has a right to demand\nreparation for an ordinary violation of its territorial\nsupremacy, but it need not take any notice of it,\nand it has no duty to demand reparation. Yet in case\na violation of its territorial supremacy constitutes at\nthe same time a violation of its neutrality, the neutral\nState has not only a right to demand reparation, but\nhas a duty [585] to do so. For, if it did not, this would\ncontain a violation of its duty of impartiality, because\nit would be favouring one belligerent to the detriment\nof the other. [586]",

I cannot agree with this opinion\neither. That a hitherto neutral can at any moment\nthrow up neutrality and take part in the war, is just as\ntrue as that a belligerent can at any moment during [Pg 381] the war declare war against a hitherto neutral State.\nYet this only proves that there is no duty to remain\nneutral, and no duty for a belligerent to abstain from\ndeclaring war against a hitherto neutral State. This is\na truism which ought not to be doubted, and is totally\ndifferent from the question as to what duties derive\nfrom neutrality so long as a certain State remains\nneutral at all. The assertion that such duties derive\nfrom neutrality is in no way inconsistent with the fact\nthat neutrality itself can at any moment during the war\ncome to an end through the beginning of war by either\na neutral or a belligerent. This assertion only states\nthe fact that, so long as neutrals intend neutrality and\nso long as belligerents intend to recognise such neutrality\nof third States, duties derive from neutrality for both\nbelligerents and neutrals.",

This would need\nno mention were it not for the purpose of distinction\nbetween hostilities on the one hand, and, on the other,\nmilitary or naval acts of force by a neutral for the\npurpose of repulsing violations of his neutrality committed\nby either belligerent. Hostilities of a neutral\nare acts of force performed for the purpose of attacking\na belligerent. They are acts of war, and they create\na condition of war between such neutral and the belligerent [Pg 387] concerned. If, however, a neutral does not\nattack a belligerent, but only repulses him by force\nwhen he violates or attempts to violate the neutrality of\nthe neutral, such repulse does not comprise hostilities.\nThus, if men-of-war of a belligerent attack an enemy\nvessel in a neutral port and are repulsed by neutral\nmen-of-war, or if belligerent forces try to make their\nway through neutral territory and are forcibly prevented\nby neutral troops, no hostilities have been\ncommitted by the neutral, who has done nothing else\nthan fulfil his duty of impartiality. Article 10 of\nConvention V. enacts categorically that \"the fact of\na neutral Power repelling, even by force, attacks on\nits neutrality, cannot be considered as a hostile act.\"\nAnd stress must be laid on the fact that it is no longer\nlegitimate for a belligerent to pursue [600] military or naval\nforces who take refuge on neutral territory; should,\nnevertheless, a belligerent do this, he must, if possible,\nbe repulsed by the neutral.",

The ends for\nwhich Japan went to war were the expulsion of the\nRussian forces from the Chinese Province of Manchuria\nand the liberation of Korea, which was at the\ntime an independent State, from the influence of\nRussia. Manchuria and Korea became therefore the [Pg 388] theatre of war, although both were neutral territories\nand although neither China nor Korea became parties\nto the war. The hostilities which occurred on these\nneutral territories were in no wise directed against the\nneutrals concerned. This anomalous condition of\nmatters arose out of the inability of both China and\nKorea to free themselves from Russian occupation and\ninfluence. And Japan considered her action, which\nmust be classified as an intervention, justified on\naccount of her vital interests. The Powers recognised\nthis anomalous condition by influencing China not to\ntake part in the war, and by influencing the belligerents\nnot to extend military operations beyond the borders\nof Manchuria. Manchuria and Korea having become\nthe theatre of war, [601] the hostilities committed there by\nthe belligerents against one another cannot be classified\nas a violation of neutrality. The case of the Variag and the Korietz on the one hand, and, on the other, the\ncase of the Reshitelni , may illustrate the peculiar condition\nof affairs:—",

[602] The complaint made by Russia, that in this\ncase the Japanese violated Korean neutrality, would\nseem to be unjustified, since Korea fell within the\nregion and the theatre of war. [Pg 389]",

Since article 21 enacts that\nan admitted prize must leave the neutral port as soon\nas the circumstances which justified its entry are at an\nend, there is no doubt that it may remain if it cannot\nby repair be made seaworthy.

And it is of importance to state the fact\nthat the restriction of article 21 does not apply to\nprizes brought into a neutral port under the rule of\narticle 23. This rule actually enables a belligerent to\nsafeguard all his prizes against recapture, and a neutral\nPower which allows belligerent prizes access to its ports\nunder the rule of article 23 would indirectly render\nassistance to the naval operations of the belligerent\nconcerned. For this reason, Great Britain as well as\nJapan and Siam entered a reservation against article 23.\nBe that as it may, those Powers which have accepted\narticle 23 will not, I believe, object to the sale in the\nneutral port concerned of such sequestrated prizes,\nprovided they have previously been condemned by the\nproper Prize Court."

In this way the Swiss Confederation\nfrequently used to furnish belligerents, and often both\nparties, with thousands of recruits, although she herself\nalways remained neutral. But at the end of the\neighteenth century a movement was started which\ntended to change this practice. In 1793 the United\nStates of America interdicted the levy of troops on her\nterritory for belligerents, and by-and-by many other\nStates followed the example. During the nineteenth\ncentury the majority of writers maintained that the\nduty of impartiality must prevent a neutral from\nallowing the levy of troops. The few [626] writers who\ndiffered made it a condition that a neutral, if he allowed\nsuch levy at all, must allow it to both belligerents alike.\nThe controversy is now finally settled, for articles 4\nand 5 of Convention V. lay down the rules that corps\nof combatants may not be formed, nor recruiting offices\nopened, on the territory of a neutral Power, and that\nneutral Powers must not allow these acts.",

                                        "An armed ship, being contraband of war, is in no\nwise different from other kinds of contraband, provided\nshe is not manned in a neutral port so that she\ncan commit hostilities at once after having reached the\nOpen Sea. A subject of a neutral who builds an armed\nship or arms a merchantman, not to order of a belligerent\nbut intending to sell her to a belligerent, does\nnot differ from a manufacturer of arms who intends to\nsell them to a belligerent. There is nothing to prevent\na neutral from allowing his subjects to sell armed vessels,\nand to deliver them to belligerents, either in a neutral\nport or in a port of the belligerent. In the case of the La Santissima Trinidad [640] (1822), as in that of the Meteor [641] (1866), American courts have recognised this. [642]",

It is\nnot necessary to go into all the details [644] of this case. It\nsuffices to say that in 1862, during the American Civil\nWar, the attention of the British Government was drawn\nby the Government of the United States to the fact that\na vessel for warlike purposes was built in England to\norder of the insurgents. This vessel, afterwards called\nthe Alabama , left Liverpool in July 1862 unarmed,\nbut was met at the Azores by three other vessels, also\ncoming from England, which supplied her with guns and\nammunition, so that she could at once begin to prey\nupon the merchantmen of the United States. On the\nconclusion of the Civil War, the United States claimed\ndamages from Great Britain for the losses sustained by [Pg 407] her merchant marine through the operations of the Alabama and other vessels likewise built in England.\nNegotiations went on for several years, and finally the\nparties entered, on May 8, 1871, into the Treaty of\nWashington [645] for the purpose of having their difference\nsettled by arbitration, five arbitrators to be nominated—Great\nBritain, the United States, Brazil, Italy, and\nSwitzerland, each choosing one.

                                        "(1) A belligerent man-of-war can abuse asylum,\nfirstly, by ascertaining whether and what kind of\nenemy vessels are in the same neutral port, accompanying\nthem when they leave, and attacking them\nimmediately they reach the Open Sea. To prevent\nsuch abuse, in the eighteenth century several neutral\nStates arranged that, if belligerent men-of-war or\nprivateers met enemy vessels in a neutral port, they\nwere not to be allowed to leave together, but an interval\nof at least twenty-four hours was to elapse between the\nsailing of the vessels. During the nineteenth century\nthis so-called twenty-four hours rule was enforced by\nthe majority of States, and the Second Peace Conference,\nby article 16 of Convention XIII., has made it a general\nrule [672] by enacting:—\"When war-ships belonging to\nboth belligerents are present simultaneously in a neutral\nport or roadstead, a period of not less than twenty-four\nhours must elapse between the departure of the ship\nbelonging to one belligerent and the departure of the\nship belonging to the other. The order of departure is\ndetermined by the order of arrival, unless the ship which\narrived first is so circumstanced that an extension of\nits stay is permissible. A belligerent war-ship may\nnot leave a neutral port or roadstead until twenty-four\nhours after the departure of a merchant ship flying the\nflag of its adversary.\"",
                                        "(2) Asylum can, secondly, be abused by wintering\nin a port in order to wait for other vessels of the same\nfleet, or by similar intentional delay. There is no\ndoubt that neutrals must prohibit this abuse by ordering\nsuch belligerent men-of-war to leave the neutral\nports. Following the example set by Great Britain in\n1862, [673] several maritime States have adopted the rule\nof not allowing a belligerent man-of-war to stay in their [Pg 422] neutral ports for more than twenty-four hours, except\non account of damage or stress of weather. Other\nStates, such as France, do not, however, object to a\nmore prolonged stay in their ports. Article 12 of\nConvention XIII. prescribes the twenty-four hours rule\nonly for those neutral countries which have not special\nprovisions to the contrary in their Municipal Laws. [674]",
                                        "(3) Asylum can, thirdly, be abused by repairing\na belligerent man-of-war which has become unseaworthy.\nAlthough small repairs are allowed, [675] a neutral\nwould violate his duty of impartiality by allowing such\nrepairs as would make good the unseaworthiness of a\nbelligerent man-of-war. During the Russo-Japanese\nWar this was generally recognised, and the Russian\nmen-of-war Askold and Grossovoi in Shanghai, the Diana in Saigon, and the Lena in San Francisco had\ntherefore to be disarmed and detained. The crews of\nthese vessels had likewise to be detained for the time of\nthe war.",
                                        "(4) Asylum can, lastly, be abused by remaining in a\nneutral port an undue length of time in order to escape\nattack and capture by the other belligerent. Neutral\nterritorial waters are in fact an asylum for men-of-war\nwhich are pursued by the enemy, but, since nowadays\na right of pursuit into neutral waters, as asserted by\nBynkershoek, [676] is no longer recognised, it would be an\nabuse of asylum if the escaped vessel were allowed to\nmake a prolonged stay in the neutral waters. A neutral\nwho allowed such abuse of asylum would violate his\nduty of impartiality, for he would assist one of the\nbelligerents to the disadvantage of the other. [677] Therefore, [Pg 423] when after the battle off Port Arthur in August\n1904 the Russian battleship Cesarewitch , the cruiser Novik , and three destroyers escaped, and took refuge in\nthe German port of Tsing-Tau in Kiao-Chau, the Novik ,\nwhich was uninjured, had to leave the port after a few\nhours, [678] whereas the other vessels, which were too\ndamaged to leave the port, were disarmed and, together\nwith their crews, detained till the conclusion of peace.\nAnd when, at the end of May 1905, after the battle\nof Tsu Shima, three injured Russian men-of-war, the Aurora , Oleg , and Jemchug , escaped into the harbour\nof Manila, the United States of America ordered them\nto be disarmed and, together with their crews, to be\ndetained during the war.",

A neutral who sold arms and ammunition\nto a belligerent at a profit would violate his duty of\nimpartiality as also would one who transferred such\narms and ammunition to a belligerent as a present.\nThis is a settled rule so far as direct transactions regarding\nsuch supply between belligerents and neutrals\nare concerned. The case is different where a neutral\ndoes not directly and knowingly deal with a belligerent,\nalthough he may, or ought to, be aware that he is indirectly\nsupplying a belligerent. Different States have\nduring neutrality taken up different attitudes regarding\nsuch cases. Thus in 1825, during the War of\nIndependence which the Spanish South American\nColonies waged against their mother country, the\nSwedish Government sold three old men-of-war, the Försigtigheten , Euridice , and Camille to two merchants,\nwho on their part sold them to English merchants,\nrepresentatives of the Government of the Mexican insurgents.\nWhen Spain complained, Sweden rescinded [Pg 427] the contract. [686] Further, the British Government in 1863,\nduring the American Civil War, after selling an old\ngunboat, the Victor , to a private purchaser and subsequently\nfinding that the agents of the Confederate States\nhad obtained possession of her, gave the order that\nduring the war no more Government ships should be\nsold. [687] On the other hand, the Government of the\nUnited States of America, in pursuance of an Act passed\nby Congress in 1868 for the sale of arms which the end\nof the Civil War had rendered superfluous, sold in 1870,\nnotwithstanding the Franco-German War, thousands\nof arms and other war material which were shipped\nto France. [688] This attitude of the United States is now\ngenerally condemned, and article 6 of Convention XIII.\nmay be quoted against a repetition of such a practice\non the part of a neutral State.

It was formerly a moot point in the theory\nof International Law whether a neutral is obliged by\nhis duty of impartiality to prevent his subjects from\ngranting subsidies and loans to belligerents for the\npurpose of enabling them to continue the war. Several\nwriters [696] maintained either that a neutral was obliged\nto prevent such loans and subsidies altogether, or at\nleast that he must prohibit a public subscription on\nneutral territory for such loans and subsidies. On the\nother hand, a number of writers asserted that, since\nmoney is just as much an article of commerce as goods, [Pg 431] a neutral was in no wise obliged to prevent on his\nterritory public subscription by his subjects to loans\nfor the belligerents. In contradistinction to the theory\nof International Law, the practice of the States has\nbeyond doubt established the fact that neutrals need\nnot prevent on their territory subscription to loans\nfor belligerents. Thus in 1854, during the Crimean\nWar, France protested in vain against a Russian loan\nbeing raised in Amsterdam, Berlin, and Hamburg. In\n1870, during the Franco-German War, a French loan\nwas raised in London. In 1877, during the Russo-Turkish\nWar, no neutral prevented his subjects from\nsubscribing to the Russian loan. Again, in 1904, during\nthe Russo-Japanese War, Japanese loans were raised\nin London and Berlin, and Russian loans in Paris and\nBerlin. The Second Peace Conference, by enacting in\narticle 7 of Convention V. that a neutral is not bound\nto prevent the export ... of anything which can be\nof use to an army or fleet, has indirectly recognised\nthat a neutral need not prevent the subscription on\nhis territory to loans for belligerents.",

                                        "But matters differ somewhat in regard to subsidies\nto belligerents by subjects of neutrals. A neutral is\nnot indeed obliged to prevent individual subjects from\ngranting subsidies to belligerents, just as he is not\nobliged to prevent them from enlisting with either\nbelligerent. But if he were to allow on his territory a\npublic appeal for subscriptions to such subsidy, he\nwould certainly violate his duty of impartiality; for\nloans are a matter of commerce, subsidies are not.\nIt must, however, be emphasised that public appeals\nfor subscriptions of money for charitable purposes in\nfavour of the wounded, the prisoners, and the like,\nneed not be prevented, even if they are only made in\nfavour of one of the belligerents.",
                                        "The distinction between loans and subsidies is [Pg 432] certainly correct as the law stands at present. But\nthere is no doubt that the fact of belligerents having\nthe opportunity of getting loans from subjects of neutrals\nis apt to lengthen wars.

His duty of impartiality rather\nobliges him in the first instance to prevent, with the\nmeans at his disposal, the belligerent concerned from\ncommitting such violation; for instance, to repulse\nan attack of men-of-war of a belligerent on enemy\nvessels in neutral ports. Thus article 3 of Convention\nXIII. enacts:—\"When a ship has been captured in the\nterritorial waters of a neutral Power, such Power must,\nif the prize is still within its jurisdiction, employ the\nmeans at its disposal to release the prize with its officers\nand crew, and to intern the prize crew.\" And in case\nhe could not prevent and repulse a violation of his\nneutrality, the same duty obliges him to exact due\nreparation from the offender, [712] for otherwise he would\nfavour the one party to the detriment of the other. If\na neutral neglects this obligation, he is thereby committing\na violation of neutrality on his part for which\nhe may be made responsible by such belligerent as has\nsuffered through the violation of neutrality committed\nby the other belligerent and acquiesced in by the\nneutral. For instance, if belligerent men-of-war seize\nenemy vessels in ports of a neutral, and if the neutral,\nwho could not or did not prevent this, exacts no reparation\nfrom the belligerent concerned, the other [Pg 442] party may make the neutral responsible for the losses\nsustained.",

This duty is\nnowadays universally recognised, but before the nineteenth century it\ndid not exist, although the rule that belligerents must not commit\nhostilities on neutral territory, and in especial in neutral ports and\nwaters, was well recognised. That in spite of its recognition this rule\nwas in the eighteenth century frequently infringed by commanders of\nbelligerent fleets, may be illustrated by many cases. Thus, for\ninstance, in 1793, the French frigate Modeste was captured in the\nharbour of Genoa by two British men-of-war (see Hall, § 220). And in\n1801, during war against Sweden, a British frigate captured the Freden and three other Swedish vessels in the Norwegian harbour of Oster-Risoer\n(see Ortolan, II. pp. 413-418).]"

This rule is adopted from\nthe arbitral award in the case of the General Armstrong .\nIn 1814, during war between Great Britain and the\nUnited States of America, the American privateer General Armstrong , lying in the harbour of Fayal,\nan island belonging to the Portuguese Azores, defended\nherself against an attack of an English squadron, but\nwas nevertheless captured. The United States claimed\ndamages from Portugal because the privateer was\ncaptured in a neutral Portuguese port. Negotiations\nwent on for many years, and the parties finally agreed\nin 1851 upon arbitration to be given by Louis Napoleon,\nthen President of the French Republic. In 1852\nNapoleon gave his award in favour of Portugal, maintaining\nthat, although the attack on the privateer in\nneutral waters comprised a violation of neutrality,\nPortugal could not be made responsible, on account of\nthe fact that the attacked privateer chose to defend\nherself instead of demanding protection from the\nPortuguese authorities.

It is obvious that the duty of a neutral not\nto acquiesce in violations of neutrality committed by [Pg 443] one belligerent to the detriment of the other obliges\nhim to repair, so far as he can, the result of such wrongful\nacts. Thus, he must liberate [716] a prize taken in his\nneutral waters, or prisoners made on his territory, and\nthe like. In so far, however, as he cannot, or not\nsufficiently, undo the wrong done, he must exact reparation\nfrom the offender. Now, no general rule can\nbe laid down regarding the mode of exacting such reparation,\nsince everything depends upon the merits of\nthe individual case. Only as regards capture of enemy\nvessels in neutral waters has a practice grown up,\nwhich must be considered binding, and according to\nwhich the neutral must claim the prize, and eventually\ndamages, from the belligerent concerned, and must\nrestore her to the other party. Thus in 1800, during\nwar between Great Britain and the Netherlands,\nPrussia claimed before the British Prize Court the Twee Gebroeders , [717] a Dutch vessel captured by the\nBritish cruiser L'Espiègle in the neutral maritime belt\nof Prussia. Sir William Scott ordered restoration of\nthe vessel, yet he refused costs and damages, because\nthe captor had not violated Prussian neutrality intentionally\nbut only by mistake and misapprehension.\nThus again, in 1805, during war between Great Britain\nand Spain, the United States claimed before the British\nPrize Court the Anna , [718] a Spanish vessel captured by\nthe English privateer Minerva within their neutral\nmaritime belt. Thus, further, in 1864, during the\nAmerican Civil War, when the Confederate cruiser Florida was captured by the Federal cruiser Wachuset in the neutral Brazilian port of Bahia, Brazil claimed\nthe prize. As the latter had sunk while at anchor in\nHampton Roads, she could not be restored, but the\nUnited States expiated the violation of neutrality [Pg 444] committed by her cruiser by court-martialing the\ncommander; further, by dismissing her Consul at\nBahia for having advised the capture; and, finally,\nby sending a man-of-war to the spot where the violation\nof neutrality had taken place for the special purpose\nof delivering a solemn salute to the Brazilian flag.

Effective blockade is\nthe contrast to so-called fictitious or paper blockade,\nwhich was frequently practised during the seventeenth,\neighteenth, and at the beginning of the nineteenth\ncentury. [757] Fictitious blockade consists in the declaration\nand notification that a port or a coast is blockaded\nwithout, however, posting a sufficient number of men-of-war\non the spot to be really able to prevent egress\nand ingress of every vessel. It was one of the principles\nof the First and of the Second Armed Neutrality that\na blockade should always be effective, but it was not\ntill after the Napoleonic wars that this principle\ngradually found universal recognition.

                                        "(1) The Second Armed Neutrality of 1800 intended\nto restrict an attempt to break blockade to the employment\nof force or ruse by a vessel on the line of\nblockade for the purpose of passing through. This\nwas, on the whole, the practice of France, which\nmoreover, as stated before, required that the vessel\nshould previous to the attempt have received special\nwarning from one of the blockading men-of-war. Many\nwriters [774] took the same standpoint.",
                                        "(2) The practice of other States, as Japan, approved\nby many writers, [775] went beyond this and considered it [Pg 469] an attempt to break blockade when a vessel, with or\nwithout force or ruse, endeavoured to pass the line\nof blockade. This practice frequently saw an attempt\ncomplete in the fact that a vessel destined for a blockaded\nplace was found anchoring or cruising near the line of\nblockade.",
                                        "(3) The practice of Great Britain and the United\nStates of America went furthest, since it considered it\nan attempted breach of blockade when a vessel, not\ndestined according to her ship papers for a blockaded\nport, was found near it and steering for it; and,\nfurther, when a vessel destined for a port, the blockade\nof which was diplomatically notified, started on her\njourney knowing that the blockade had not been\nraised, except when the port from which the vessel\nsailed was so distant from the scene of war as to justify\nher master in starting for a destination known to be\nblockaded, on the chance of finding that the blockade\nhad been removed, and with an intention of changing\nher destination should that not prove to be the case. [776] This practice, further, applied the doctrine of continuous\nvoyages [777] to blockade, for it considered an\nattempt of breach of blockade to have been committed\nby such vessel as, although ostensibly destined for a\nneutral or an unblockaded port, is in reality intended,\nafter touching there, to go on to a blockaded port. [778]",
                                        "(4) During the Civil War the American Prize Courts\ncarried the practice further by condemning such vessels\nfor breach of blockade as knowingly carried to a neutral\nport cargo ultimately destined for a blockaded port,\nand by condemning for breach of blockade such cargo,\nbut not the vessel, as was ultimately destined for a\nblockaded port, when the carrying vessel was ignorant [Pg 470] of this ulterior destination of the cargo. Thus the Bermuda , [779] a British vessel with a cargo, part of which\nwas, in the opinion of the American Courts, ultimately\ndestined for the blockaded ports of the Confederate\nStates, was seized on her voyage to the neutral British\nport of Nassau, in the Bahama Islands, and condemned\nfor breach of blockade by the American Courts. The\nsame happened to the British vessel Stephen Hart , [780] which was seized on her voyage to the neutral port of\nCardenas, in Cuba. And in the famous case of the Springbok , [781] a British vessel also destined for Nassau,\nin the Bahama Islands, which was seized on her voyage\nto this neutral British port, the cargo alone was finally\ncondemned for breach of blockade, since, in the opinion\nof the Court, the vessel was not cognisant that the\ncargo was intended to reach a blockaded port. The\nsame happened to the cargo of the British vessel Peterhoff [782] destined for the neutral port of Matamaros,\nin Mexico. The British Government declined to intervene\nin favour of the British owners of the respective\nvessels and cargoes. [783]",

The term contraband is derived from the\nItalian \"contrabbando,\" which, itself deriving from the\nLatin \"contra\" and \"bannum\" or \"bandum,\" means\n\"in defiance of an injunction.\" Contraband of war [813] is the designation of such goods as by either belligerent\nare forbidden to be carried to the enemy on the ground\nthat they enable the latter to carry on the war with\ngreater vigour. But this definition is only a formal\none, as it does not state what kinds of goods belong\nto the class of contraband. This point was much\ncontroverted before the Declaration of London.\nThroughout the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth\ncenturies the matter stood as Grotius had explained it.\nAlthough he does not employ the term contraband, he\ntreats of the matter. He [814] distinguishes three different\nkinds of articles. Firstly, those which, as arms for\ninstance, can only be made use of in war, and which\nare, therefore, always contraband. Secondly, those, as\nfor example articles of luxury, which can never be made\nuse of in war and which, therefore, are never contraband.\nThirdly, those which, as money, provisions, ships, and\narticles of naval equipment, can be made use of in war\nas well as in peace, and which are on account of their [Pg 481] ancipitous use contraband or not according to the\ncircumstances of the case. In spite of Bynkershoek's\ndecided opposition [815] to this distinction by Grotius, the\npractice of most belligerents until the beginning of the\ntwentieth century has been in conformity with it. A\ngreat many treaties have from the beginning of the\nsixteenth century been concluded between many States\nfor the purpose of fixing what articles belonging to the\nclass of ancipitous use should, and what should not, be\nregarded between the parties as contraband, but these\ntreaties disagree with one another. And, so far as they\nwere not bound by a treaty, belligerents formerly\nexercised their discretion in every war according to the\nspecial circumstances and conditions in regarding or not\nregarding certain articles of ancipitous use as contraband.\nThe endeavour of the First and the Second Armed\nNeutrality of 1780 and 1800 to restrict the number and\nkinds of articles that could be regarded as contraband\nfailed, and the Declaration of Paris of 1856 uses the\nterm contraband without any attempt to define it.",

There are even several [822] writers who emphatically\ndeny that foodstuffs could ever be conditional\ncontraband. But the majority of writers\nhas always admitted that foodstuffs destined for the\nuse of the enemy army or navy might be declared\ncontraband. This has been the practice of Great\nBritain, [823] the United States of America, and Japan.\nBut in 1885, during her hostilities against China,\nFrance declared rice in general as contraband, on the\nground of the importance of this article to the Chinese\npopulation. And Russia in 1904, during the Russo-Japanese\nwar, declared rice and provisions in general\nas contraband; on the protest of Great Britain and\nthe United States of America, however, she altered her\ndecision and declared these articles conditional contraband\nonly.",

No argument against their character\nas conditional contraband can have any basis. But\nthey were frequently declared absolute contraband, as,\nfor instance, by article 36 of the United States Naval\nWar Code of 1900. Russia, which during the Russo-Japanese\nWar altered the standpoint taken up at first\nby her, and recognised the distinction between absolute\nand conditional contraband, nevertheless maintained [Pg 487] her declaration of horses and beasts of burden as\nabsolute contraband. The Declaration of London, by\narticle 22, No. 7, declares them as absolute contraband.",
                                        "(3) Since men-of-war are nowadays propelled by\nsteam power, the importance of coal , and eventually\nother fuel for waging war at sea is obvious. For this\nreason, Great Britain has ever since 1854 maintained\nthat coal, if destined for belligerent men-of-war or\nbelligerent naval ports, is contraband. But in 1859\nFrance and Italy did not take up the same standpoint.\nRussia, although in 1885 she declared that she would\nnever consent to coal being regarded as contraband,\nin 1904 declared coal, naphtha, alcohol, and every other\nkind of fuel, absolute contraband. And she adhered to\nthis standpoint, although she was made to recognise\nthe distinction between absolute and conditional contraband.",

                                        "(5) As regards raw cotton , it is asserted [824] that in\n1861, during the Civil War, the United States declared\nit absolute contraband under quite peculiar circumstances,\nsince it took the place of money sent abroad\nfor the purpose of paying for vessels, arms, and ammunition.\nBut this assertion is erroneous. [825] Be that as it [Pg 488] may, raw cotton should not, under ordinary circumstances,\nbe able to be considered absolute contraband.\nFor this reason Great Britain protested when Russia,\nin 1904 during the Russo-Japanese War, declared\ncotton in general as contraband; Russia altered her\nstandpoint and declared cotton conditional contraband\nonly.

Arms and ammunition\ndestined for a neutral are as little contraband as other\ngoods with the same destination.

On occasions a neutral vessel carrying such\narticles as are contraband if they have a hostile destination\nis, according to her papers, ostensibly bound\nfor a neutral port, but is intended, after having called\nand eventually having delivered her cargo there, to\ncarry the same cargo from there to an enemy port.\nThere is, of course, no doubt that such vessels are\ncarrying contraband whilst engaged in carrying the\narticles concerned from the neutral to the enemy port.\nBut during the American Civil War the question arose\nwhether they may already be considered to be carrying\ncontraband when on their way from the port of starting\nto the neutral port from which they are afterwards to\ncarry the cargo to an enemy port, since they are really\nintended to carry the cargo from the port of starting\nto an enemy port, although not directly, but circuitously,\nby a roundabout way. The American Prize Courts\nanswered the question in the affirmative by applying\nto the carriage of contraband the principle of dolus non\npurgatur circuitu and the so-called doctrine of continuous\nvoyages. [834] This attitude of the American Prize [Pg 500] Courts has called forth protests from many authorities, [835] British as well as foreign, but Great Britain has not\nprotested, and from the attitude of the British Government\nin the case of the Bundesrath and other vessels in\n1900 during the South African War it could safely,\nalthough indirectly only, be concluded that Great\nBritain considered the practice of the American Prize\nCourts correct and just, and that, when a belligerent,\nshe intended to apply the same principles. This could\nalso be inferred from § 71 of Holland's Manual of Naval\nPrize Law , which established the rule: \"The ostensible\ndestination of a vessel is sometimes a neutral port,\nwhile she is in reality intended, after touching, and\neven landing and colourably delivering over her cargo\nthere, to proceed with the same cargo to an enemy port.\nIn such a case the voyage is held to be 'continuous,'\nand the destination is held to be hostile throughout.\"\nAnd provided that the intention of the vessel is really\nto carry the cargo circuitously, by a roundabout way,\nto an enemy port, and further provided, that a mere\nsuspicion is not held for a proof of such intention, I\ncannot see why this application of the doctrine of continuous\nvoyages should not be considered reasonable,\njust, and adequate.",

Neutral vessels engaged in French and Spanish colonial\ntrade, thrown open to them during the war, sought to evade seizure by\nBritish cruisers and condemnation by British Prize Courts, according to\nthe rule of 1756, by taking their cargo to a neutral port, landing it\nand paying import duties there, and then re-lading it and carrying it to\nthe mother country of the respective colony. Thus in the case of the William (1806), 5 C. Rob. 385, it was proved that this neutral vessel\ntook a cargo from the Spanish port La Guira to the port of Marblehead in\nMassachusetts—the United States being neutral—landed the cargo, paid\nimport duties there, then took in the chief part of this cargo besides\nother goods, and sailed after a week for the Spanish port of Bilbao. In\nall such cases the British Prize Courts considered the voyages from the\ncolonial port to the neutral port and from there to the enemy port as\none continuous voyage and confirmed the seizure of the ships concerned.\nSee Remy, Théorie de la continuauté du voyage en matière de blocus et\nde contrebande (1902); Hansemann, Die Lehre von der einheitlichen\nReise im Rechte der Blockade und Kriegskonterbande (1910), and\nFauchille in R.G.

And [Pg 501] the question has arisen whether such vessels on their\nvoyage to the neutral port may be considered to be\ncarrying contraband of war. [836] As early as 1855, during\nthe Crimean War, the French Conseil-Général des Prises,\nin condemning the cargo of saltpetre of the Hanoverian\nneutral vessel Vrow Houwina , answered the question\nin the affirmative; [837] but it was not until the American\nCivil War that the question was decided on principle.\nSince from the British port of Nassau, in the Bahamas,\nand from other neutral ports near the coast of the Confederate\nStates, goods, first brought to these nearer\nneutral ports by vessels coming from more distant\nneutral ports were carried to the blockaded coast of\nthe Southern States, Federal cruisers seized several\nvessels destined and actually on their voyage to Nassau\nand other neutral ports because all or parts of their\ncargoes were ultimately destined for the enemy. And\nthe American Courts considered those vessels to be carrying\ncontraband, although they were sailing from one\nneutral port to another, on clear proof that the goods\nconcerned were destined to be transported by land or\nsea from the neutral port of landing into the enemy\nterritory. The leading cases are those of the Springbok and Peterhoff , which have been mentioned above in § 385 (4) , for the Courts found the seizure of these and [Pg 502] other vessels justified on the ground of carriage of\ncontraband as well as on the ground of breach of\nblockade. Thus, another application of the doctrine\nof continuous voyages came into existence, since vessels\nwhilst sailing between two neutral ports could only be\nconsidered to be carrying contraband when the transport\nfirst from one neutral port to another and afterwards\nfrom the latter to the enemy territory had been regarded\nas one continuous voyage.

This application of the doctrine of continuous\nvoyages under the new form of continuous transports\nhas likewise been condemned by many British and\nforeign authorities; but Great Britain did not protest\nin this case either—on the contrary, as was mentioned\nabove in § 385 (4) , she declined to interfere in favour of\nthe British owners of the vessels and cargoes concerned.\nAnd that she really considered the practice of the\nAmerican Courts just and sound became clearly apparent\nby her attitude during the South African War. When,\nin 1900, the Bundesrath , Herzog , and General , German\nvessels sailing from German neutral ports to the Portuguese\nneutral port of Lorenzo Marques in Delagoa Bay,\nwere seized by British cruisers under the suspicion\nof carrying contraband, Germany demanded their\nrelease, maintaining that no carriage of contraband\ncould be said to take place by vessels sailing from one\nneutral port to another. But Great Britain refused\nto admit this principle, maintaining that articles\nultimately destined for the enemy were contraband,\nalthough the vessels carrying them were bound for a\nneutral port.

Thus,\nGessner (p. 119) emphatically asserts that the destination\nof the carrying vessel is of no importance compared\nwith the destination of the carried goods themselves.\nBluntschli, although he condemns in § 835 the American\npractice regarding breach of blockade committed by a\nvessel sailing from one neutral port to another, expressly\napproves in § 813 of the American practice\nregarding carriage of contraband by a vessel sailing\nbetween two neutral ports, yet carrying goods with a\nhostile destination. Kleen (I. § 95, p. 388) condemns\nthe rule that the neutral destination of the vessel makes\nthe goods appear likewise neutral, and defends seizure\nin the case of a hostile destination of the goods on a\nvessel sailing between two neutral ports; he expressly\nstates that such goods are contraband from\nthe moment the carrying vessel leaves the port of\nloading. Fiore (III. No. 1649) reprobates the theory\nof continuous voyages as applied by British and\nAmerican Courts, but he asserts nevertheless that the\nhostile destination of certain goods carried by a vessel\nsailing to a neutral port justifies the vessel being regarded\nas carrying contraband, and the seizure thereof. Bonfils\n(No. 1569) takes up the same standpoint as Bluntschli,\nadmitting the application of the theory of continuous\nvoyages to carriage of contraband, but reprobating its\napplication to breach of blockade. And the Institute\nof International Law adopted the rule: [843] \" La destination\npour l'ennemi est présumée lorsque le transport va\nà l'un de ses ports, ou bien à un port neutre qui, d'après [Pg 505] des preuves évidentes et de fait incontestable, n'est qu'une\nétape pour l'ennemi, comme but final de la même opération\ncommerciale. \" Thus this representative body of authorities\nof all nations has fully adopted the American\napplication of the doctrine of continuous voyages to\ncontraband, and thereby recognised the possibility of\ncircuitous as well as indirect carriage of contraband.",

In Sweden the same was valid. [844] Thus, further, an Italian Prize Court during the war with\nAbyssinia in 1896 justified the seizure in the Red Sea\nof the Dutch vessel Doelwijk , [845] which sailed for the\nneutral French port of Djibouti, carrying a cargo of\narms and ammunition destined for the Abyssinian\narmy and to be transported to Abyssinia after having\nbeen landed at Djibouti.",

The penalty\nwas frequently confiscation not only of the contraband\ncargo itself, but also of all other parts of the cargo,\ntogether with the vessel. Only France made an exception,\nsince according to an ordonnance of 1584 she\ndid not even confiscate the contraband goods themselves,\nbut only seized them against payment of their value,\nand it was not until 1681 that an ordonnance proclaimed\nconfiscation of contraband, but with exclusion of the\nvessel and the innocent part of the cargo. [848] During the\nseventeenth century this distinction between contraband\non the one hand, and, on the other, the innocent goods\nand the vessel was clearly recognised by Zouche and\nBynkershoek, and confiscation of the contraband only\nbecame more and more the rule, certain cases excepted.\nDuring the eighteenth century the right to confiscate\ncontraband was frequently contested, and it is remarkable\nas regards the change of attitude of some States\nthat by article 13 of the Treaty of Friendship and\nCommerce [849] concluded in 1785 between Prussia and\nthe United States of America all confiscation was\nabolished. This article provided that the belligerent\nshould have the right to stop vessels carrying contraband\nand to detain them for such length of time as might be\nnecessary to prevent possible damage by them, but such\ndetained vessels should be paid compensation for the\narrest imposed upon them. It further provided that\nthe belligerent could seize all contraband against [Pg 509] payment of its full value, and that, if the captain of a\nvessel stopped for carrying contraband should deliver\nup all contraband, the vessel should at once be set free.\nI doubt whether any other treaty of the same kind was\nentered into by either Prussia or the United States. [850] And it is certain that, if any rule regarding penalty\nfor carriage of contraband was generally recognised\nat all, it was the rule that contraband goods could be\nconfiscated. But there always remained the difficulty\nthat it was controversial what articles were contraband,\nand that the practice of States varied much regarding\nthe question as to whether the vessel herself and innocent\ncargo carried by her could be confiscated. For beyond\nthe rule that absolute contraband could be confiscated,\nthere was no unanimity regarding the fate of the vessel\nand the innocent part of the cargo. Great Britain and\nthe United States of America hitherto confiscated the\nvessel when the owner of the contraband was also the\nowner of the vessel; they also confiscated such part\nof the innocent cargo as belonged to the owner of the\ncontraband goods; they, lastly, confiscated the vessel,\nalthough her owner was not the owner of the contraband,\nprovided he knew of the fact that his vessel was\ncarrying contraband, or provided the vessel sailed with\nfalse or simulated papers for the purpose of carrying\ncontraband. [851] Some States allowed such vessel carrying\ncontraband as was not herself liable to confiscation to\nproceed with her voyage on delivery of her contraband [Pg 510] goods to the seizing cruiser, [852] but Great Britain [853] and\nother States insisted upon the vessel being brought\nbefore a Prize Court in every case.",

                                        "§ 407. Before the Declaration of London the term unneutral service was used by several writers with\nreference to the carriage of certain persons and despatches\nfor the enemy on the part of neutral vessels.\nThe term has been introduced in order to distinguish\nthe carriage of persons and despatches for the enemy\nfrom the carriage of contraband, as these were often\nconfounded with each other. Since contraband consists [Pg 516] of certain goods only and never of persons or despatches,\na vessel carrying persons and despatches for the enemy\nis not thereby actually carrying contraband. [858] And\nthere is another important difference between the two.\nCarriage of contraband need not necessarily, and in most\ncases actually does not, take place in the direct service\nof the enemy. On the other hand, carriage of persons\nand despatches for the enemy always takes place in the\ndirect service of the enemy, and, consequently, represents\na much more intensive assistance of, and a much\nmore intimate connection with, the enemy than carriage\nof contraband. For these reasons a distinct treatment\nof carriage of contraband, on the one hand, and carriage\nof persons and despatches, on the other, was certainly\nconsidered desirable by many publicists. Those writers\nwho did not adopt the term unneutral service , on\naccount of its somewhat misleading character, preferred [859] the expression analogous of contraband , because\nin practice maritime transport for the enemy was always\ntreated in analogy with, although not as, carriage of\ncontraband.",
                                        "[Footnote 858: This was recognised in the case of the Yangtsze Insurance\nAssociation v. Indemnity Mutual Marine Assurance Company , L.R.\n(1908), 1 K.B. 910 and 2 K.B. 504.]",
                                        "[Footnote 859: It was also preferred in the first edition of this work.\nBut it was necessary to abandon further resistance on account of the\nfact that after the official adoption, in the translation of the\nDeclaration of London, of the term unneutral service it was useless to\noppose it.]",
                                        "The Declaration of London puts the whole matter\nupon a new and very much enlarged basis, for Chapter\nIII. treats in articles 45 to 47, under the heading De\nl'assistance hostile —the official English translation of\nwhich is unneutral service —not only of the carriage of\npersons for the enemy on the part of a neutral vessel,\nbut also of the transmission of intelligence in the interest\nof the enemy, the taking of a direct part in the hostilities,\nand a number of other acts on the part of a\nneutral vessel. Accordingly the Declaration of London [Pg 517] makes a distinction between two kinds of unneutral\nservice, meting out for the one a treatment analogous\nin a general way to contraband, and for the other a\ntreatment analogous to that of enemy merchant vessels.\nCarriage of individual members of the armed forces of\nthe enemy and a certain case of transmission of intelligence\nin the interest of the enemy constitute the first\nkind, and four groups of acts creating enemy character\nfor the vessel concerned constitute the second kind.

Thus, for instance, if the head of the enemy\nState or one of his cabinet ministers fled the country\nto avoid captivity, the neutral vessel that carried him\ncould have been punished, as could also the vessel\ncarrying an agent of the enemy sent abroad to negotiate\na loan and the like. However, the mere fact that\nenemy persons were on board a neutral vessel did not\nin itself prove that these persons were carried by the\nvessel for the enemy and in his service. This was the\ncase only when either the vessel knew of the character\nof the persons and nevertheless carried them, thereby\nacting in the service of the enemy, or when the vessel [Pg 518] was directly hired by the enemy for the purpose of\ntransport of the individuals concerned. Thus, for\ninstance, if able-bodied men booked their passages on\na neutral vessel to an enemy port with the secret intention\nof enlisting in the forces of the enemy, the\nvessel could not be considered as carrying persons for\nthe enemy; but she could be so considered if an agent\nof the enemy openly booked their passages. Thus,\nfurther, if the fugitive head of the enemy State booked\nhis passage under a false name, and concealed his\nidentity from the vessel, she could not be considered\nas carrying a person for the enemy; but she could be so\nconsidered if she knew whom she was carrying, because\nshe was then aware that she was acting in the service\nof the enemy. As regards a vessel directly hired by\nthe enemy, there could be no doubt that she was acting\nin the service of the enemy. Thus the American vessel Orozembo [861] was in 1807, during war between England\nand the Netherlands, captured and condemned, because,\nalthough chartered by a merchant in Lisbon\nostensibly to sail in ballast to Macao and to take from\nthere a cargo to America, she received by order of the\ncharterer three Dutch officers and two Dutch civil\nservants, and sailed, not to Macao, but to Batavia.\nAnd the American vessel Friendship [862] was likewise in\n1807, during war between England and France, captured\nand condemned, because she was hired by the French\nGovernment to carry ninety shipwrecked officers and\nsailors home to a French port.",

Thus, in 1802, during war [Pg 519] between Great Britain and France, the Swedish vessel Carolina [863] was condemned by Sir William Scott for\nhaving carried French troops from Egypt to Italy,\nalthough the master endeavoured to prove that the\nvessel was obliged by force to render the transport\nservice.

The importance of\nthis exception became apparent in\nthe case of the Trent which occurred\nduring the American War. On\nNovember 8, 1861, the Federal cruiser San Jacinto stopped the British mail\nsteamer Trent on her voyage from\nHavana to the British port of Nassau,\nin the Bahamas, forcibly took off\nMessrs. Mason and Slidell, together\nwith their secretaries, political agents\nsent by the Confederate States to\nGreat Britain and France, and then\nlet the vessel continue her voyage.\nGreat Britain demanded their immediate\nrelease, and the United\nStates at once granted this, although\nthe ground on which release was\ngranted was not identical with the\nground on which release was demanded.\nThe Government of the\nUnited States maintained that the\nremoval of these men from the vessel\nwithout bringing her before a Prize\nCourt for trial was irregular, and,\ntherefore, not justified, whereas release\nwas demanded on the ground\nthat a neutral vessel could not be\nprevented from carrying diplomatic\nagents sent by the enemy to neutrals.\nNow diplomatic agents in the proper\nsense of the term these gentlemen\nwere not, because although they were\nsent by the Confederate States, the\nlatter were not recognised as such,\nbut only as a belligerent Power. Yet\nthese gentlemen were political agents\nof a quasi-diplomatic character, and\nthe standpoint of Great Britain was\nfor this reason perhaps correct. The\nfact that the Governments of France,\nAustria, and Prussia protested through\ntheir diplomatic envoys in Washington\nshows at least that neutral vessels\nmay carry unhindered diplomatic\nagents sent by the enemy to neutrals,\nhowever doubtful it may be whether\nthe same is valid regarding agents\nwith a quasi-diplomatic character.\nSee Parliamentary Papers , 1862, North\nAmerica, N. 5; Marquardsen, Der\nTrent Fall (1862); Wharton, § 374;\nMoore, VII. § 1265; Phillimore, II.\n§§ 130-130 A ; Mountague Bernard, Neutrality of Great Britain during the\nAmerican Civil War (1870), pp. 187-205;\nHarris, The Trent Affair (1896).

Thus, the American vessel Rapid , [868] which was captured in 1810 during the war between\nGreat Britain and the Netherlands, on her voyage from\nNew York to Tonningen, for having on board a despatch\nfor a Cabinet Minister of the Netherlands hidden under\na cover addressed to a merchant at Tonningen, was\nreleased by the Prize Court.

If a neutral merchantman—see\nabove, §§ 85 , 181, and 254 —without Letters of\nMarque during war and from hatred of one of the\nbelligerents, were to attack and sink merchantmen of\nsuch belligerent, she would have to be considered, and\ncould therefore be treated as, a pirate.",

For\nthe time being she is, therefore, actually part and\nparcel of the enemy marine. For this reason she is\nconsidered to be rendering unneutral service, and to\nhave lost her neutral character, even if, at the moment\nan enemy cruiser searches her, she is engaged neither in\nthe transport of troops nor in the transmission of\nintelligence. The fact is decisive that she is for the\ntime being exclusively intended for such unneutral\nservice, whether or no she is at every moment really [Pg 526] engaged in rendering such service.

The Peace of Westminster in 1654\nbrought this war to an end, and in 1756 the Netherlands,\nthen neutral, claimed the right of convoy. But it was [Pg 536] not until the last quarter of the eighteenth century that\nthe right of convoy was more and more insisted upon\nby Continental neutrals. During the American War\nof Independence in 1780, the Netherlands again claimed\nthat right, and when they themselves in 1781 waged\nwar against Great Britain, they ordered their men-of-war\nand privateers to respect the right of convoy.\nBetween 1780 and 1800 treaties were concluded, in\nwhich Russia, Austria, Prussia, Denmark, Sweden,\nFrance, the United States of America, and other States\nrecognised that right. But Great Britain always\nrefused to recognise it, and in July 1800 the action of a\nBritish squadron in capturing a Danish man-of-war\nand her convoy of six merchantmen for resistance to\nvisitation called the Second Armed Neutrality into\nexistence. Yet Great Britain still resisted, and by\narticle 4 of the \"Maritime Convention\" of St. Petersburg\nof June 17, 1801, she conceded to Russia only that\nvessels under convoy should not be visited by privateers.\nDuring the nineteenth century more and more treaties\nstipulating the right of convoy were concluded, but\nthis right was not mentioned in the Declaration of\nParis of 1856, and Great Britain refused to recognise\nit throughout the century. However, Great Britain\nabandoned her opposition at the Naval Conference of\nLondon of 1908-9, and the Declaration of London\nproposes to settle the matter by articles 61 and 62 in\nthe following way:—",

Should\nthe commander of the belligerent man-of-war have [Pg 537] reason to suspect that the confidence of the commander\nof the convoy has been abused, he may not\nhimself resort to visit and search, but must communicate\nwith the commander of the convoy. The latter must\ninvestigate the matter, and must record the result of\nhis investigation in a report, a copy of which must be\ngiven to the commander of the belligerent cruiser.\nShould, in the opinion of the commander of the convoy,\nthe facts stated in the report justify the capture of one\nor more of the convoyed vessels, he must withdraw\nprotection from the offending vessels, and the belligerent\ncruiser may then capture them.",
                                        "In case a difference of opinion arises between the\ncommander of the convoy and the commander of the\nbelligerent cruiser—for instance, with regard to the\nquestion as to whether certain goods are absolute or\nconditional contraband or as to whether the port of\ndestination of a convoyed vessel is an ordinary commercial\nport or a port which serves as a base of supply\nfor the armed forces of the enemy and the like—the\ncommander of the belligerent cruiser has no power of\noverruling the decision of the commander of the convoy.\nHe can only protest and report the case to his\nGovernment, which will settle the matter by means\nof diplomacy."

Be that as it may, according\nto article 49 only such neutral prizes may be sunk as\nwould be liable to confiscation if brought before a\nPrize Court. Sinking of captured neutral vessels—apart\nfrom neutral vessels which have acquired enemy\ncharacter and may for this reason be sunk under the\nsame conditions as enemy vessels—is, therefore, chiefly\nadmitted in three [915] cases, namely: (1) When—see\narticle 40 of the Declaration of London—the vessel [Pg 550] carries contraband the value of which forms more than\nhalf the value of the cargo; (2) when a vessel has been\ncaptured for rendering those kinds of unneutral service\nwhich are enumerated by article 45 of the Declaration\nof London; (3) when—see article 21 of the Declaration\nof London—a vessel has been captured for breach of\nblockade. In no case, however, in which she is not\nliable to confiscation, may a neutral vessel under any\ncircumstances and conditions be destroyed; she must\nalways be abandoned if the capturing cruiser cannot\ntake her into a port of a Prize Court.",
                                        "[Footnote 915: Only such cases of possible confiscation of a neutral\nvessel are mentioned in the text as are in accordance with the\nDeclaration of London.

It will be the task of the\nInternational Prize Court to evolve a uniform practice with regard to\nsuch cases. Likewise the text does not enumerate the cases in which the\nsinking of a neutral vessel is permissible because she previously\nacquired enemy character; concerning this, see above, § 89 .]",
                                        "However this may be, when the captor feels compelled\nto resort to the destruction of a neutral prize, he\nmust place in safety all persons found on the captured\nvessel, and he must take on board all the captured ship's\npapers which are relevant for the purpose of deciding\nthe validity of the capture (article 50). And (article 51)\nif the captor fails to establish the fact before the Prize\nCourt that he destroyed the prize in the face of an\nexceptional necessity, the owners of the vessel and\ncargo must receive full compensation without any\nexamination of, and any regard to, the question as to\nwhether or no the capture itself was justifiable. Compensation\nmust likewise be paid in case the capture is\nheld by the Prize Court to be invalid, although the act\nof destruction has been held to be justifiable (article 52).\nAnd in any case, the owners of neutral goods not liable\nto condemnation which have been destroyed with the\nvessel, may always and under all circumstances and\nconditions claim damages (article 53).",
                                        "Thus many safeguards have been established against\narbitrariness in resorting to the destruction of neutral\nprizes. On the other hand, it would seem to be going\ntoo far to insist on the captor letting the prize go with\nher contraband on board, if he be compelled to abandon\nthe prize. For this reason article 54 empowers the [Pg 551] captor of a neutral vessel herself not liable to confiscation,\nto demand the handing over, or to proceed\nhimself to the destruction, of any goods liable to confiscation\nfound on board, if the taking of the vessel\ninto a port of a Prize Court would involve danger to\nthe captor or to the success of the operations in which\nhe is at the time of capture engaged. Details concerning\nsuch destruction have been given above in\n§ 406 a (2)."

The second appeal may never\nby decided by a National, but must always be decided\nby the International Prize Court.
